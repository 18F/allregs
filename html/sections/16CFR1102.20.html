                                Sec. 1102.20  Transmission of reports of harm to the identified manufacturer
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information transmitted. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, the Commission will transmit all information provided in a report of harm, provided such report meets the minimum requirements for publication in the Database, to the manufacturer or private labeler identified in a report of harm. The following information will not be transmitted to a manufacturer or private labeler:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and contact information for the submitter of the report of harm, unless such submitter provides express written consent (for example, by checking a box on the report of harm) to provide such information to the manufacturer or private labeler;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Photographs that could be used to identify a person; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Medical records, unless the person about whom such records pertain, or his or her parent, guardian, or appropriate legally authorized representative, consents to providing such records to the manufacturer or private labeler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation on use of contact information. A manufacturer or private labeler who receives name and contact information for the submitter of a report of harm and/or a victim must not use or disseminate such information to any other party for any other purpose other than verification of information contained in a report of harm. Verification of information contained in a report of harm must not include activities such as sales, promotion, marketing, warranty, or any other commercial purpose. Verification of information contained in a report of harm may include verification of the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identity of the submitter and/or the victim, including name, location, age, and gender;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consumer product, including serial or model number, date code, color, or size;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Harm or risk of harm related to the use of the consumer product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Description of the incident related to use of the consumer product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Date or approximate date of the incident; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Category of submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing. To the extent practicable, the Commission will transmit a report of harm to the manufacturer or private labeler within five business days of submission of the completed report of harm. If the Commission cannot determine whom the manufacturer or private labeler is from the report of harm, or otherwise, then it will not post the report of harm on the Database but will maintain the report for internal agency use. Examples of circumstances that may arise that may make transmission of the report of harm impracticable within five business days include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer or private labeler is out of business with no identifiable successor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The submitter misidentified a manufacturer or private labeler;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The report of harm contained inaccurate or insufficient contact information for a manufacturer or private labeler; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission cannot locate valid contact information for a manufacturer or private labeler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Method of transmission. The Commission will use the method of transmission and contact information provided by the manufacturer or private labeler. The Commission will transmit reports of harm to a manufacturer or private labeler who has registered with the Commission as described in paragraph (f) of this section. If a manufacturer or private labeler has not registered with the Commission, the Commission will send reports of harm through the United States mail to the firm's principal place of business, unless the Commission selects another equally effective method of transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Size limits of manufacturer comments. The Commission may, in its discretion, limit the data size of comments, which may include attachments submitted, where such comments and attachments may negatively impact the technological or operational performance of the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Manufacturer registration. Manufacturers and private labelers may register with the Commission to select a preferred method for receiving reports of harm that identify such firm as the manufacturer or private labeler. Manufacturers and private labelers that choose to register with the Commission must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Register with the Commission through a process identified for such registration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide and maintain updated contact information for the firm, including the name of the firm, title of a person to whom reports of harm should be directed, complete mailing address, telephone number, electronic mail address, and Web site address (if any); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Select a specified method to receive reports of harm that identify the firm as the manufacturer or private labeler of a consumer product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Manufacturer comments. A manufacturer or private labeler who receives a report of harm from the CPSC may comment on the information contained in such report of harm. The Commission, in its discretion, where it determines it is in the public interest, may choose not to publish a manufacturer comment in the Database. For example, it may not be in the public interest for the Commission to publish comments that, in the unlikely event, contain language reasonably described as lewd, lascivious, or obscene.</p>
