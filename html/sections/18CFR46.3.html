                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compilation and filing list. On or before January 31 of each  year, each public utility shall compile a list of the purchasers  described in paragraph (b) of this section and shall identify each  purchaser by name and principal business address. The public utility  must submit the list to the Secretary of the Commission in accordance  with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at http:// www.ferc.gov and make the list publicly available through its principal  business office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Largest purchasers. The list required under paragraph (a) of  this section shall include each purchaser who, during any of the three  (3) preceding calendar years, purchased (for purposes other than resale)  from a public utility one of the twenty (20) largest amounts of electric  energy measured in kilowatt hours sold (for purposes other than resale)  by such utility during such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules. If data for actual annual sales (for purposes  other than resale) are not available in the records of the public  utility, the utility may use estimates based on actual data available to  it. If one purchaser maintains several billing accounts with the public  utility, the kilowatt hours purchased in each account of that purchaser  shall be aggregated to arrive at the total for that purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification of largest purchasers. Each public utility shall  notify by January 31 of each year each purchaser which has been  identified on the list of largest purchasers under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Revision of the list. Each public utility relying upon any  estimates for its January 31st filing, shall revise the list compiled  under paragraph (b) of this section no later than March 1 of the year in  which the list was originally filed to reflect actual data not available  to the utility prior to that time. Any revised list shall be filed with  the Commission and made publicly available through the utility's  principal business office no later than March 1. A utility filing a  revised list shall indicate thereon the changes made to the list  previously filed under paragraph (b) of this section. On or before the  filing and publication of the revised list, the public utility shall  notify the newly-listed purchasers and any purchasers whose names were  removed from the list.
