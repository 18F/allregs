                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Minimizing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, the grantee must ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted with HTF funds. To the extent feasible, displaced residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex upon completion of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Temporary relocation. The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex upon completion of the project; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relocation assistance for displaced persons--(1) General. A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and 49 CFR part 24. A ``displaced person'' must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, the minority person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and 49 CFR part 24. A ``displaced person'' must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, the minority person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Displaced person. (i) For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``displaced person'' means a person (family individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership or association) that moves from real property or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted with HTF funds. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``displaced person'' means a person (family individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership or association) that moves from real property or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted with HTF funds. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date of the submission of an application to the grantee or HUD, if the applicant has site control and the application is later approved; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date the grantee approves the applicable site, if the applicant does not have site control at the time of the application; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Before the date described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if the grantee or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering the tenant the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a term of at least one year at a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tenant's monthly rent before such agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.628, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the grantee determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance. The effective date of any termination or refusal to renew must be preceded by at least 30 calendar days advance written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for the action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The person moved into the property after the submission of the application, but before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, incur a rent increase), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The grantee may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the formula for computing replacement housing assistance to be provided under this paragraph (c) to a tenant displaced from a dwelling as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term ``initiation of negotiations'' means the execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Optional relocation assistance. The grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms displaced by a project assisted with HTF funds where the displacement is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide relocation assistance to persons covered

under paragraph (c) of this section beyond that required. For any such assistance that is not required by State or local law, the grantee must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the optional relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Real property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Appeals. A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person may be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee.</p>
