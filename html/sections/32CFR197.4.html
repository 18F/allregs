                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy, pursuant to E.O. 12958, that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Anyone accessing classified material must possess the requisite  security clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information requested by historical researchers shall be  accessed at a DoD activity or facility under the control of the National  Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Usually such access will  occur at either the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) in  Suitland, Maryland, or NARA's Archives II in College Park, Maryland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to records by historical researchers shall be limited to  the specific records within the scope of the proposed historical  research over which the Department of Defense has classification  authority. Access shall also be limited to any other records for which  the written consent of other Agencies that have classification authority  over information contained in or revealed by the records has been  obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to unclassified OSD Component files by historical  researchers shall be permitted consistent with the restrictions of the  exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act that are contained in E.O.  12958 and explained in the appendix B to this part (5 U.S.C. 552). The  procedures for access to classified information shall be used if the  requested unclassified information is contained in OSD files whose  overall markings are classified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under E.O. 12958, or its successor, persons permanently assigned  within the Executive Branch may be authorized access to classified  information for official projects under DoD classification authority,  provided such access is essential to the accomplishment of a lawful and  authorized Government purpose and a written determination of the  trustworthiness of the persons has been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under E.O. 12958 and paragraph C6.2.2. of DoD 5200.01-R, persons  not permanently assigned within the Executive Branch who are engaged in  historical research projects or persons permanently assigned within the  Executive Branch engaged in personal, i.e. unofficial projects, may be  authorized access to classified information under DoD classification  authority. The authorization shall be based on a written determination  of the researcher's trustworthiness, on the proposed access being in the  interests of national security, and on the researcher signing a copy of  the letter (appendix E to this part) by which he or she agrees to  safeguard the information and to authorize a review of any notes and  manuscript for a determination that they contain no classified  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Access for former Presidential appointees is limited to records  they originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as  Presidential appointees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contractors working for Executive Branch Agencies may be allowed  access to classified OSD Component files. No copies of still classified  documents will be released directly to a contractor. All copies of  classified documents needed for a classified project will be forwarded  to the office of the Contracting Government Agency responsible for  monitoring the project. The monitoring office will be responsible for  ensuring that the contractor safeguards the documents. The information  is only used for the project for which it was requested, and that the  contractor returns the documents upon completion of the final project.  All copies of documents needed for an unclassified project will undergo  a mandatory declassification review before the copies are released to  the contractor to use in the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The records maintained in OSD Component office files and at the  WNRC cannot be segregated, requiring that authorization be received from  all agencies whose classified information is or is expected to be in the  requested files for access to be permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> All researchers must hold security clearances at the  classification level of the requested information. In addition, all DoD  employed requesters, to include DoD contractors, must have Critical  Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI) access and all other  Executive Branch and non-Executive   Branch requesters must have a Department of Energy issued ``Q''  clearance to access CNWDI information.</p>
