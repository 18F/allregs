                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In designating a National Marine Sanctuary, the Secretary shall  prepare the designation materials described in section 304 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a proposed Sanctuary includes waters within the exclusive  economic zone, the Secretary shall notify the appropriate Regional  Fishery Management Council(s) which shall have one hundred and twenty  (120) days from the date of such notification to make recommendations  and, if appropriate, prepare draft fishery regulations and to submit  them to the Secretary. In preparing its recommendations and draft  regulations, the Council(s) shall use as guidance the national standards  of section 301(a) of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1851) to the extent  that they are consistent and compatible with the goals and objectives of  the proposed Sanctuary designation. Fishery activities not proposed for  regulation under section 304(a)(5) of the Act may be listed in the draft  Sanctuary designation document as potentially subject to regulation,  without following the procedures specified in section 304(a)(5) of the  Act. If the Secretary subsequently determines that regulation of any  such fishery activity is necessary, then the procedures specified in  section 304(a)(5) of the Act shall be followed.
