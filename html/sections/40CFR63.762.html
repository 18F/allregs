                                Sec.  63.762  Affirmative defense for violations of emission standards
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions set forth in this subpart shall apply at all  times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)-(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in  this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil  penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by  malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be  assessed; however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the  requirements in the affirmative defense, the affirmative defense shall  not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce  such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of  evidence that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The violation:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of  air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to  operate in a normal or usual manner; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper  design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been  foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate  design, operation, or maintenance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation  occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent  practicable to make these repairs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including  any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or  a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,  personal injury, or severe property damage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in  operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air  pollution control practices; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All of the actions in response to the violation were  documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner  consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of  which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the  malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at  issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods  and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the  result of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative  defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all  necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set  forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense  report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation  report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial  occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the  end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation  report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the  initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may  be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess  emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the  relevant standard.
