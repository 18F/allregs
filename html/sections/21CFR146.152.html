Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the   applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter. In addition,  the name of each preservative shall be proceeded by a statement of the  percent by weight of the preservative used. If the food is packed in  container sizes that are less than 19 liters (5 gallons), the label  shall bear a statement indicating that the food is for further  manufacturing use only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so  conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of  purchase, the statement specified in paragraph (d) of this section for  naming the preservative ingredient used shall immediately and  conspicuously precede or follow the name of the food, without  intervening written, printed, or graphic matter.
