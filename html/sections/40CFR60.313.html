The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility, except as provided under Sec. 60.313(c)(2) and (c)(3). Each monthly calculation is considered a performance test. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) each calendar month will be determined by the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the mass of VOC's used (Mo+Md) during each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.015

Select the appropriate transfer efficiency from table 1. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis. Transfer efficiency values for application methods not listed below shall be determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the accuracy of the transfer efficiency claims.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Transfer Efficiencies------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Transfer</p><p class="depth0">Application methods                      efficiency</p><p class="depth0"><em>(T)</em>------------------------------------------------------------------------Air atomized spray..........................................        0.25Airless spray...............................................         .25Manual electrostatic spray..................................         .60Nonrotational automatic electrostatic spray.................         .70Rotating head electrostatic spray (manual and automatic)....         .80Dip coat and flow coat......................................         .90Electrodeposition...........................................         .95------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where more than one application method is used within a single surface coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the composition and volume of each coating applied by each method through a means acceptable to the Administrator and compute the weighted average transfer efficiency by the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.017
