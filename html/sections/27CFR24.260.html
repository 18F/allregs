                                Sec. 24.260  Serial numbers or filling date.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each container larger than four liters or each case used for removing wine for consumption or sale will be marked with a serial number or filling date at the time of filling or when such containers or cases are prepared for removal. Serial numbers will commence with ``1'' and continue until the numeral ``1,000,000'' is reached, whereupon the series may recommence with the numeral ``1.'' However, the proprietor may initiate a new series after the numeral ``1,000,000'' has been reached provided no numeral will be used more than once during a 12-month period. If desired, a separate series of numbers with letter prefixes may be used for containers larger than four liters and for cases, or for cases filled on different bottling lines, or for removals from different loading docks. The proprietor may mark containers larger than four liters or the cases with the filling date in lieu of using a serial number or use both a serial number and the filling date. However, if the proprietor desires to change from the use of a serial number to use of a filling date, or vice versa, a notice will be sent to the appropriate TTB officer before making the change. Where United States or foreign wine is recased, the cases will be marked with the date of recasing, preceded by the letter ``R'', in lieu of serial number or filling date.
