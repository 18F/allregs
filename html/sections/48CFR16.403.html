                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. A fixed-price incentive contract is a fixed-price  contract that provides for adjusting profit and establishing the final  contract price by application of a formula based on the relationship of  total final negotiated cost to total target cost. The final price is  subject to a price ceiling, negotiated at the outset. The two forms of  fixed-price incentive contracts, firm target and successive targets, are  further described in 16.403-1 and 16.403-2 below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A fixed-price incentive contract is appropriate  when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A firm-fixed-price contract is not suitable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other  circumstances of the acquisition are such that the contractor's  assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive  profit incentive for effective cost control and performance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the contract also includes incentives on technical  performance and/or delivery, the performance requirements provide a  reasonable opportunity for the incentives to have a meaningful impact on  the contractor's management of the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Billing prices. In fixed-price incentive contracts, billing  prices are established as an interim basis for payment. These billing  prices may be adjusted, within the ceiling limits, upon request of  either party to the contract, when it becomes apparent that final  negotiated cost will be substantially different from the target cost.
