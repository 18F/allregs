                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Life insurance company taxable income defined. Section 802(b)  defines the term life insurance company taxable income, for purposes of  part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, as the sum of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The taxable investment income (as defined in section 804), or,  if smaller, the gain from operations (as defined in section 809),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the gain from operations exceeds the taxable investment  income, an amount equal to 50 percent of such excess, plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and  this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. For the taxable year 1959, Y, a life insurance company,  has taxable investment income of $250,000, and a gain from operations of  $175,000. Y made no subtractions from the policyholders surplus account  during such taxable year. For the taxable year 1959, Y has life  insurance company taxable income of $175,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that for  the taxable year 1959, Y has a gain from operations of $400,000. For the  taxable year 1959, Y has life insurance company taxable income of  $325,000, computed by adding taxable investment income ($250,000) and 50  percent ($75,000) of the amount ($150,000) by which the gain from  operations ($400,000) exceeds the taxable investment income ($250,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. For the taxable year 1959, W, a life insurance company,  has taxable investment income of zero (0) and a gain from operations of  $90,000. W made no subtractions from the policyholders surplus account  during such taxable year. For the taxable year 1959, W has life  insurance company taxable   income of $45,000, computed by adding taxable investment income (0) and  50 percent ($45,000) of the amount ($90,000) by which the gain from  operations ($90,000) exceeds the taxable investment income (0).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. For the taxable year 1961, Z, a life insurance company,  has taxable investment income of $100,000, a policyholders surplus  account of $50,000 as of the beginning of such taxable year, a loss from  operations (as defined in section 809(b)(2)) of $25,000, and  subtractions from the policyholders surplus account in the amount of  $20,000. For the taxable year 1961, Z has life insurance company taxable  income of $20,000, as only the amount ($20,000) subtracted from the  policyholders surplus account is taken into account.
