                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(i)</em> in that  only one-sixth of the policy term fell within the cost accounting period  which ended December 31, 1980, and therefore only one-sixth of the  premium should have been included in cost in that cost accounting  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractor B has a retrospectively rated worker's compensation  insurance program. The policy term corresponds with the contractor's  cost accounting period. Premium refunds are normally received and  applied in the following cost accounting period. The contractor's  practice is to include the entire gross premium in insurance cost in the  cost accounting period in which it is paid and to credit the refund  against insurance cost in the cost accounting period in which it is  received. This practice conforms with 9904.416-50(a)(1)(i). The  contractor could also, under the provisions of 9904.416-50(a)(1)(vi),  have followed a consistent practice of estimating such refunds in  advance and including the estimated net premium in insurance cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor C establishes a self-insured program of life  insurance for active and retired persons. The contractor pays death  benefits directly to the beneficiaries of deceased employees and  includes such payments in insurance costs at the time of payment. This  practice complies with 9904.416-50(a)(2)(iii) which requires that only  the actual losses be recognized unless a trusteed reserve or fund is  established in accordance with 9904.416-50(a)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Instead of paying death benefits directly, contractor D  purchases annual group term life insurance on active and retired persons  and charges the premiums to insurance costs (with proper recognition for  refunds and dividends). Contractor D's retired persons wish to be  protected against possible discontinuance of the program. Contractor D,  therefore, establishes a trusteed fund. As each employee retires,  contractor D deposits in the fund an amount which is equal to the  premium on a paid-up policy for that employee, and he advises the  trustee that the fund is to be used to continue to pay premiums on  retired persons in the event the program is discontinued. The contractor  also continues to purchase group term insurance on both active employees  and retired persons and charges both the premiums and the deposits to  insurance costs. This practice does not comply with 9904.416- 50(a)(1)(iv)(D) which requires that if payments to accomplish the stated  objectives of the reserve or funds are made from a source other than the  reserve or fund, the payments into the fund shall be reduced  accordingly.</p><p class="depth2">Note: In this instance the contractor could comply with the standard  by paying from the fund that portion of the group term premium which  represented the retired persons or by reducing the deposits to the fund  by an equivalent amount in accordance with 9904.416-50(a)(1)(iv)(D).  This practice would also comply with the requirement of 9904.416- 50(a)(1)(v)(C) that the amount added to the fund not be greater than an  amount which would be required to fairly allocate the cost over the  working lives of the active employees in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contractor E wishes to provide assurance of his life insurance  program continuance to both active and retired employees. He establishes  a trusteed fund in accordance with 9904.416-50(a)(1) (iv) and (v) and  thereafter pays into the fund each year for each active employee an  actuarially determined amount which will accumulate to the equivalent of  the premium on a paid-up life insurance policy at retirement. He charges  the annual payments to insurance costs. Benefits are paid directly from  the fund (or the fund is used to pay the annual premiums on group term  life insurance for all employees). This practice also complies with the  requirement of 9904.416-50(a)(1)(v)(C) that the amount added to the fund  not be greater than an amount which would be required to fairly allocate  the cost over the working lives of the active employees in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contractor F has a fire insurance policy which provides that the  first   $50,000 of any fire loss will be borne by the contractor. Because the  risk of loss is dispersed among many physical units of property and the  average potential loss per unit is relatively low, the actual losses in  any period may be expected not to differ significantly from the  projected average loss. Therefore, the contractor intends to let the  actual losses represent the projected average loss for this exposure to  risk. Property with an actual cash value of $80,000 is destroyed in a  fire. The contractor charges the $50,000 of the loss not covered by the  policy to insurance costs for contract costing purposes. The practice  complies with the requirement of 9904.416-50(a)(2). However, had the  contractor's plan been to make a self-insurance charge for such losses,  then any difference between the self-insurance charge and actual losses  in that cost accounting period would not have been allocable as an  insurance cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contractor G is preparing to enter into a Government contract to  produce explosive devices. The contractor is unable to purchase adequate  insurance protection and must act as a self-insurer. There is a  significant possibility of a major loss, against which the Government  will not undertake to indemnify the contractor. The contractor,  therefore, intends to make a self-insurance charge for this exposure to  risk. The contractor may, in accordance with 9904.416-50(a)(2)(i), use  data obtained from other contractors or any other reasonable method of  estimating the projected average loss in order to determine the self- insurance charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contractor H purchases liability insurance for all of its motor  vehicles in a single, company-wide policy which contains a $50,000  deductible provision. However, the company's management policy provides  that when a loss is incurred in a segment, only the first $5,000 of the  loss will be charged to the segment; the balance of the loss will be  absorbed at the home-office level and reallocated among all segments.  Because the risk of loss is dispersed among many physical units and the  maximum potential loss per occurrence is limited, the actual losses in  any cost accounting period may be expected not to differ significantly  from the projected average loss. Therefore, the contractor intends to  let the actual losses represent the projected average loss for this  exposure to risk. An analysis of the loss experience shows that many  past losses exceeded $5,000. Contractor H's practice of allocating the  loss in excess of $5,000 to the home office is a violation of 9904.416- 50(b)(1). The limit of $5,000 cannot realistically be considered a  measure of a ``catastrophic'' loss when losses frequently exceed this  amount, and the use of a limit this low would obscure segment loss  experience.</p>
