This limitation does  not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In bankruptcy cases, GSA will ascertain the impact of the  Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or  contemplated collections by offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory centralized administrative offset. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> GSA is required  to refer past due, legally enforceable non-tax debts that are over 180  days delinquent to the Secretary for collection by centralized  administrative offset. Debts that are less than 180 days delinquent also  may be referred to the Secretary for this purpose. See paragraph (b)(5)  of this section for debt certification requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who  owe debts referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section will be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be  made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials  include disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the  Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other  Government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States  designated by the Secretary. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the  name and TIN of a payee and all other requirements for offset have been  met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in  writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a  past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice will include a  description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset  was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of GSA as  the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within  GSA who will respond to questions regarding the offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt,  the intention of GSA to use administrative offset to collect the debt,  and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(7);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The debtor has been given--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records related to  the debt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The opportunity for a review within GSA of the determination of  indebtedness (see paragraph (e) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section  may be omitted when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile  Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and  other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not  supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets  accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted  under paragraph (c) of this section, GSA first learns of the existence  of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before  payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and  an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for  review are omitted, GSA will give the debtor such notice and an  opportunity for review as soon as practicable and will promptly refund  any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When GSA previously has given a debtor any of the required  notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see,  e.g., Sec. 105-55.010), the Agency need not duplicate such notice and  review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, GSA will  certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> GSA has complied with all due process requirements under 31  U.S.C. 3716(a) and Agency regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt  from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary shall exempt  payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative  offset when requested in writing by the Administrator. Also, the  Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset  upon the written request of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  301 et seq.), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 et  seq.), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other  than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury  regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security  Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of  Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive  the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of  1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and  verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative  offset upon receipt of a certification from GSA that the due process  requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. The  certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this  section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only  the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required  to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C.  3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Non-centralized administrative offset. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally, non- centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that  GSA conducts, at the Agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation  with another agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor.  Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative  offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable  non-tax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized  administrative offset. In these cases, GSA may make a request directly  to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to  collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for GSA to  request the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal  employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service to satisfy  an unpaid advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such offsets will occur only after--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in  paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payment authorizing agency has received written  certification from GSA that the debtor owes the past due, legally  enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that GSA has fully  complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment authorizing agencies will comply with offset requests by  GSA to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would  not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the  program of the payment authorizing agency, or would otherwise be  contrary to law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative  offset, GSA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in  accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined  by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the  applicable statute of limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future  benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.  Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded  the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, GSA may  request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments  under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in  accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808.  Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and ``flag'' a  debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests,  or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will  satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration  of the   time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Review requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A debtor may seek review of a debt by  sending a signed and dated petition for review to the official named in  the demand letter. A copy of the petition must also be sent to the  Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) at 1800 F Street NW.,  Washington, DC 20405.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford  a debtor a review within the Agency, the hearing official will provide  the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the  debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the hearing official  determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by  review of the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of  the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Witnesses will be asked to testify under oath or affirmation,  and a written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available  to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. Arrangements for the taking of the  transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges  associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility  of GSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this  section, the hearing official will accord the debtor a ``paper  hearing,'' that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration  based upon a review of the written record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Hearings will be conducted by a Board Judge of the CBCA. GSA  must provide proof that a valid non-tax debt exists, and the debtor must  provide evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is  incorrect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an oral hearing is provided, the debtor may choose to have it  conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW.,  6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location designated by the  hearing official, or may choose a hearing by telephone. All personal and  travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person  hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred  during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the debtor is an employee of GSA, the employee may represent  himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her  choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for  representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel  expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A written decision will be issued by the hearing official no  later than 60 days from the date the petition for review is received by  GSA. The decision will state the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hearing officials analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the  debtor's and/or GSA's grounds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount and validity of the debt; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Repayment schedule, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action  for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure  Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Waiver requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under certain circumstances, a waiver  of a claim against an employee of GSA arising out of an erroneous  payment of pay, allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation  expenses and allowances may be granted in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> GSA procedures for waiving a claim of erroneous payment of pay  and allowances can be found in GSA Order CFO 4200.1, ``Waiver of Claims  for Overpayment of Pay and Allowances''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> GSA will follow the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5584 when considering  a request for waiver of erroneous payment of travel, transportation, or  relocation expenses and allowances.
