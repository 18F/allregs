                            <p class="depth0">Federal implementation of the Act will be consistent with the  President's policy of decentralized decisionmaking and administrative  responsibility which gives fullest possible consideration to State and  local rural development goals and priorities. As a result of section  817(4) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L.  93-86) which prohibits prior approval by any State officials of any loan  or grant under any program authorized by title I of the Rural  Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419), it has been necessary to  substantially modify the planned administration of programs under  section 603 of the Rural Development Act.</p>
