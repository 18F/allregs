For guidance see Sec. 86.129-80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fuel temperature profile--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be  tested for running losses, as specified in Sec. 86.134, a vehicle must  have a fuel temperature profile. The following procedure is used to  generate the fuel temperature profile, which serves as a target for  controlling fuel temperatures during the running loss test. This profile  represents the fuel temperature change that occurs during on-road  driving. If a vehicle has more than one fuel tank, a profile shall be  established for each tank. Manufacturers may also simultaneously  generate a profile for vapor temperatures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a manufacturer uses a vehicle model to develop a profile to  represent multiple models, the vehicle model selected must have the  greatest expected fuel temperature increase during driving of all those  models it represents. Also, manufacturers must select test vehicles with  any available vehicle options that increase fuel temperatures during  driving (for example, any feature that limits underbody airflow).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturers may conduct testing to develop fuel temperature  profiles in a laboratory setting, subject to approval by the  Administrator. The laboratory facility should simulate outdoor testing  to reproduce fuel and vapor temperature behavior over the   specified driving schedule. The design of the laboratory facility should  include consideration of any parameters that may affect fuel  temperatures, such as solar loading, pavement heat, and relative wind  velocities around and underneath the test vehicle. Indoor testing to  develop the fuel temperature profiles must be conducted with little or  no vehicle-specific adjustment of laboratory parameters. Manufacturers  would need to maintain an ongoing demonstration of correlation between  laboratory and outdoor measurement of fuel temperatures. Specifically,  fuel temperatures and pressures from indoor driving should be at least  as high as measured when driving outdoors according to the procedures  described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Small-volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.094-14(b)(1),  may use an alternate method for generating fuel temperature profiles,  subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Administrator may conduct testing to establish any vehicle's  temperature profiles or to verify compliance with fuel tank pressure  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle instrumentation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vehicle must be equipped with  temperature sensors and pressure transducers, as described in  Sec. 86.107-96 (e) and (f), and a driver's aid, which shall be  configured to provide the test driver with the desired vehicle speed vs.  time trace and the actual vehicle speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A computer, data logger, or strip chart data recorder shall  record the following parameters at a minimum during the test run:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Desired speed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Actual speed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Instantaneous average liquid fuel temperature (Tliq);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vapor space pressure (the Administrator may omit measurement of  fuel tank pressure).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The data recording system described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of  this section shall be capable of resolving time to [1 s, capable of  resolving temperature to [2 F, capable of resolving pressure to [1.0  inch of water, and capable of resolving speed to [1 mph. The temperature  and pressure signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 minute;  speed signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 second.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ambient conditions. The procedure shall be run under the  following ambient conditions. Conditions should be representative of  sunny summer days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Starting ambient temperature (Tamb, o) shall be at  least 95 F, steady or increasing (no more than 2 F drop) during the  procedure. Ambient temperature shall be measured and recorded in regular  intervals of at least once every 5 minutes. Measure ambient temperature  with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for Siting  Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The sensors shall be  mounted 5 [1 feet (1.5 [0.3 meters) above ground level. The sensors  shall be protected from radiation from the sun, sky, earth, and any  other surrounding objects, but at the same time be adequately  ventilated. The sensors shall be installed in such a position as to  ensure that measurements are representative of the free air circulation  in the locality and not influenced by artificial conditions such as  large buildings, cooling towers, and expanses of concrete and tarmac.  Keep any grass and vegetation within 100 feet (30 meters) of the sensor  clipped to a height of about 10 inches (25 centimeters) or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Wind conditions shall be calm to light with maximum wind speed  of 15 mph. In the case of temporary gusting, wind speeds between 15 and  25 mph may occur for up to 5 percent of the total driving time without  invalidating the data collection. Wind speed shall be measured and  recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. Measure wind  speed with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for  Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The site should  be relatively level, but small gradual slopes are acceptable. The sensor  shall be mounted 30 to 33 feet (9 to 10 meters) above the average ground  height within a radius of 500 feet (150 meters). The sensor height shall  not exceed 33 feet, except as necessary to be at least 15 feet (5  meters) above the height of any obstruction (e.g. vegetation, buildings,  etc.) within a 500 foot (150 meter) radius. An object is considered to  be an obstruction if the included lateral   angle from the sensor to the ends of the object is 10 degrees or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Road surface temperature shall be at least 125 F throughout  the driving period. Pavement temperature shall be measured and recorded  in regular intervals of at least once per minute. The track temperature  may be measured with an embedded sensor, a portable temperature probe,  or an infrared pyrometer that can provide an accuracy of [2 F.  Temperatures must be measured on a surface representative of the surface  where the vehicle is driven.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Conditions shall be sunny or mostly sunny with a maximum cloud  cover of 25 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reported cloud cover, wind speed, and ambient temperature should  be consistent with that reported by the nearest weather station; the  Administrator may request justification of any discrepancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Profile determination procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Drain the fuel tank(s) and  fill with test fuel to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082- 2. The test fuel should meet the specifications of Sec. 86.113, except  that fuel with a lower volatility may be used, subject to Administrator  approval. Manufacturers using a lower volatility fuel must generate a  vapor temperature profile for demonstrating compliance with the limit on  fuel tank pressure during the running loss test (see Sec. 86.134-96).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vehicle shall be moved to the location where the data is to  be collected. It may be driven a maximum distance of 5 miles and may  also be transported by other means. The vehicle shall be stabilized by  one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vehicle shall be parked for a minimum of 12 hours in an open  area on a surface that is representative of the test road, without any  artificial heating or cooling of the fuel. The orientation of the front  of the vehicle during parking (e.g., N, SW, etc.) shall be documented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The vehicle may be soaked in a temperature-controlled  environment to stabilize fuel temperatures. Before starting the drive,  the vehicle shall be stabilized with fuel temperatures 95 [3 F for at  least one hour. The fuel temperature may not exceed 98 F at any time  before the beginning of the driving schedule, during which only whole- vehicle heating and cooling may be used to control fuel temperatures. If  a manufacturer uses the provisions of paragraph (d)(7)(v) of this  section to establish a lower initial fuel temperature for the running  loss test, the fuel in the test vehicle may not be stabilized at a  temperature higher than the newly established initial fuel temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once the ambient conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3) of  this section are met and the vehicle has been stabilized according to  paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the vehicle's engine may be  started. The vehicle's air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be  set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum  discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with  automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set  to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system  set at 72 F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The vehicle may be operated at minimum throttle for a period up  to 60 seconds prior to the start of the driving schedule, as necessary  to move from the parking location onto the road surface. The driver's  aid shall be started and the vehicle operated over the driving cycle  specified in Sec. 86.134-96(b) with the transmission operated in the  same manner as specified in Sec. 86.128-79. The data recording system  shall provide a record of the required parameters over the entire period  of driving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records required. In addition to the vehicle data recording, the  following parameters shall be documented for the determination of the  fuel temperature profile:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Date and time of vehicle fueling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Odometer reading at vehicle fueling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Date and time vehicle was parked, parking location and  orientation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Odometer reading at parking;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Date and time engine was started;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Time of initiation of first UDDS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Time of completion of the driving cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Ambient temperatures throughout the period of driving  (Tamb);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Wind speed throughout the period of driving;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Track surface temperatures throughout the period of driving  cycle (Tsur);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Percent cloud cover during the period of driving; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Ambient temperature, wind speed, and percent cloud cover  reported by the nearest weather station for the time corresponding most  closely to the period of driving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fuel tank pressure. Tank pressure shall not exceed 10 inches of  water at any time during the temperature profile determination unless a  pressurized system is used and the manufacturer demonstrates that vapor  would not be vented to the atmosphere upon fuel cap removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Calculation of temperature profiles. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The traces from the  driving schedule shall be verified to meet the speed tolerance  requirements of Sec. 86.115. The following conditions shall be verified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Tamb, i=Tamb, o-2 F.  Where,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>i=instantaneous measurement throughout the drive; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>o=initial measurement at the start of the specified driving  schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tamb, o=95 F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tsur, i-Tamb, i=30 F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Wmax<=15 mph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to comply with any of these requirements shall result  in invalidation of the data and require that the procedure be repeated,  beginning with the fuel drain at paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If all these requirements are met, the following calculations  shall be performed to determine a profile for liquid fuel temperatures  and, if applicable, for vapor temperatures: Ti, profile = Ti-To.  Where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ti,profile = the series of temperatures that comprise  the relative temperature profile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ti = the series of observed liquid fuel or vapor  temperatures during the drive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To = the liquid fuel or vapor temperature observed at  the start of the specified driving schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The relative temperature profile consists of the set of  temperatures at each 1-minute interval. If temperatures are sampled more  frequently than once per minute, the temperature data points may  represent a rolling average of temperatures sampled for up to one-minute  intervals. If multiple valid test runs are conducted for any model, then  all the collected data shall be used to calculate a composite profile,  based on the average temperatures at each point. The absolute  temperature profile is determined by adding 95 F (35 C) to each point  of the relative profile. Other methodologies for developing corrected  liquid fuel and vapor space temperature profiles may be used if  demonstrated to yield equivalent results and approved in advance by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Manufacturers may use a lower initial fuel temperature for the  running loss test, if approved in advance by the Administrator. To  demonstrate the need for such an adjustment, manufacturers would be  expected to determine the maximum fuel temperature experienced by a  vehicle during an extended park or after driving one UDDS cycle when  exposed to the ambient conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section. To use this provision, manufacturers would have to show maximum  fuel temperatures no greater than 92 F.
