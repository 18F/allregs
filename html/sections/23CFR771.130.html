                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A draft EIS, final EIS, or supplemental EIS may be supplemented  at any time. An EIS shall be supplemented whenever the Administration  determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Changes to the proposed action would result in significant  environmental impacts that were not evaluated in the EIS; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New information or circumstances relevant to environmental  concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts would result  in significant environmental impacts not evaluated in the EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, a supplemental EIS will not be necessary where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The changes to the proposed action, new information, or new  circumstances result in a lessening of adverse environmental impacts  evaluated in the EIS without causing other environmental impacts that  are significant and were not evaluated in the EIS; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administration decides to approve an alternative fully  evaluated in an approved final EIS but not identified as the preferred  alternative. In such a case, a revised ROD shall be prepared and  circulated in accordance with Sec. 771.127(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the Administration is uncertain of the significance of the  new impacts, the applicant will develop appropriate environmental  studies or, if the Administration deems appropriate, an EA to assess the  impacts of the changes, new information, or new circumstances. If, based  upon the studies, the Administration determines that a supplemental EIS  is not necessary, the Administration shall so indicate in the project  file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A supplement is to be developed using the same process and  format (i.e., draft EIS, final EIS, and ROD) as an original EIS, except  that scoping is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A supplemental draft EIS may be necessary for major new fixed  guideway capital projects proposed for FTA funding if there is a  substantial change in the level of detail on project impacts during  project planning and development. The supplement will address site- specific impacts and refined cost estimates that have been developed  since the original draft EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In some cases, a supplemental EIS may be required to address  issues of limited scope, such as the extent of proposed mitigation or  the evaluation of location or design variations for a limited portion of  the overall project. Where this is the case, the preparation of a  supplemental EIS shall not necessarily:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prevent the granting of new approvals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the withdrawal of previous approvals; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require the suspension of project activities; for any activity  not directly affected by the supplement. If the changes in question are  of such magnitude to require a reassessment of the entire action, or  more than a limited portion of the overall action, the Administration  shall suspend any activities which would have an adverse environmental  impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives, until the  supplemental EIS is completed.
