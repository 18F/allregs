                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where available Federal appropriations are inadequate to cover  the subsidy cost, a non-Federal infrastructure partner may pay to the  Administrator a Credit Risk Premium adequate to cover that portion of  the subsidy cost not covered by Federal appropriations. Where there is  no Federal appropriation, the Credit Risk Premium must cover the entire  subsidy cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the Credit Risk Premium required for each direct  loan or loan guarantee, if any, shall be established by the  Administrator. The   Credit Risk Premium shall be determined based on the credit risk and  anticipated recovery in the event of default, including the recovery of  collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Credit Risk Premium must be paid before the disbursement of  a direct or guaranteed loan. Where the borrower draws down the direct or  guaranteed loan in several increments, the borrower may pay a portion of  the total Credit Risk Premium for each increment equal to the proportion  of that increment to the total amount of the direct or guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each direct loan and loan guarantee made by the Administrator  will be included in one cohort of direct loans or one cohort of loan  guarantees, respectively, made during that same fiscal year, or longer  period, as may be determined by the Administrator. When all obligations  in a cohort have been satisfied or liquidated, the amount of Credit Risk  Premiums, paid by applicants or infrastructure partners, remaining in  the cohort, after deductions made to mitigate losses from any loan or  loan guarantee in the cohort, together with interest accrued thereon,  will be repaid on a pro rata basis to each original payor of a Credit  Risk Premium for any obligation which was fully satisfied. If the  Administrator's estimate of the default risk cost of each loan is  accurate, the aggregate of Credit Risk Premiums associated with each  cohort of loans will fully offset all losses in the cohort and none will  remain to be returned to the payees.</p>
