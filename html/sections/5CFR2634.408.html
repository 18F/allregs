                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules on communications between the independent fiduciaries and the interested parties. (1) There shall be no direct or indirect communications with respect to the qualified trust between an interested party or the party's representative and the independent trustee or any other designated fiduciary with respect to the trust unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of the blind trust, the proposed communication is approved in advance by the Director and it relates to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The general financial interest and needs of the interested party including, but not limited to, a preference for maximizing income or long-term capital gain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Notification to the independent trustee by the employee that the employee is prohibited by a subsequently applicable statute, Executive order, or regulation from holding an asset, and to direction to the independent trustee that the trust shall not hold that asset; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Instructions to the independent trustee to sell all of an asset which was initially placed in the trust by an interested party, and which in the determination of the employee creates a real or apparent conflict due to duties the employee subsequently assumed (but nothing herein requires such instructions); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of the diversified trust, the proposed communication is approved in advance by the Director and it relates to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The general financial interest and needs of the interested party including, but not limited to, a preference for maximizing income or long-term capital gain; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Information, documents, and funds concerning income tax obligations arising from sources other than the property held in trust that are required by the independent trustee to enable him to file, on behalf of an interested party, the personal income tax returns and similar tax documents which may contain information relating to the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person initiating a communication approved under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section shall file a copy of the communication with the Director within five days of the date of its transmission.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a): By the terms of paragraph (3)(C)(vi) of section 102(f) of the Act, communications which solely consist of requests for distributions of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust are not required to be in writing. Further, there is no statutory mechanism for pre-screening of proposed communications. However, experience of the Office of Government Ethics over the years dictates the necessity of prohibiting any oral communications between the trustee and an interested party with respect to the trust and pre-screening all proposed written communications, to prevent inadvertent prohibited communications and preserve confidence in the Federal qualified trust program. Accordingly, under its authority pursuant to paragraph (3)(D) of section 102(f) of the Act, the Office of Government Ethics will not approve proposed trust instruments that do not contain language conforming to this policy, except in unusual cases where compelling necessity is demonstrated to the Director, in his or her sole discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Required reports from the independent trustee to the interested parties--(1) Quarterly reports. The independent trustee shall, without identifying specifically an asset or holding, report quarterly to the interested parties and their representatives the aggregate market value of the assets representing the interested party's interest in the trust. The independent trustee must follow the model document for this report and shall file a copy of the report, within five days of the date of its transmission, with the Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual report. In the case of a qualified blind trust, the independent trustee shall, without identifying specifically an asset or holding, report annually to the interested parties and their representatives the aggregate amount of the trust's income attributable to the interested party's beneficial interest in the trust, categorized in accordance with Sec. 2634.302(b) to enable the employee to complete the public financial disclosure form. In the case of a qualified diversified trust, the independent trustee shall, without identifying specifically an asset or holding, report annually to the interested parties and their representatives the aggregate amount actually distributed from the trust to the interested party or applied for the party's benefit. Additionally, in the case of the blind trust, the independent trustee shall report on Schedule K-1 the net income or loss of the trust and any other information necessary to enable the interested party to complete an individual

tax return. The independent trustee must follow the model document for each report and shall file a copy of the report, within five days of the date of its transmission, with the Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Report of sale of asset. In the case of the qualified blind trust, the independent trustee shall promptly notify the employee and the Director when any particular asset transferred to the trust by an interested party has been completely disposed of or when the value of that asset is reduced to less than $1,000. The independent trustee shall file a copy of the report, within five days of the date of its transmission, with the Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Communications regarding trust and beneficiary taxes. The Act establishes special tax filing procedures to be used by the independent trustee and the trust beneficiaries in order to maintain the substantive separation between trust beneficiaries and trust administrators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Trust taxes. Because a trust is a separate entity distinct from its beneficiaries, an independent trustee must file an annual fiduciary tax return for the trust (IRS Form 1041). The independent trustee is prohibited from providing the interested parties and their representatives with a copy of the trust tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beneficiary taxes. The trust beneficiaries must report income received from the trust on their individual tax returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For beneficiaries of qualified blind trusts, the independent trustee sends a modified K-1 summarizing trust income in appropriate categories to enable the beneficiaries to file individual tax returns. The independent trustee is prohibited from providing the interested parties or their representatives with the identity of the assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For beneficiaries of qualified diversified trusts, the Act requires the independent trustee to file the individual tax returns on behalf of the trust beneficiaries. The interested parties shall give the independent trustee a power of attorney to prepare and file, on their behalf, the personal income tax returns and similar tax documents which may contain information relating to the trust. Appropriate Internal Revenue Service power of attorney forms shall be used for this purpose. The beneficiaries must transmit to the trustee materials concerning taxable transactions and occurrences outside of the trust, pursuant to the requirements in each trust instrument which detail this procedure. This communication must be approved in advance by the Director in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Some qualified trust beneficiaries may pay estimated income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In order to pay the proper amount of estimated taxes each quarter, the beneficiaries of a qualified blind trust will need to receive information about the amount of income, if any, generated by the trust each quarter. To assist the beneficiaries, the independent trustee is permitted to send, on a quarterly basis, information about the amount of income generated by the trust in that quarter. This communication must be approved in advance by the Director in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In order to pay the proper amount of estimated taxes each quarter, the independent trustee of a qualified diversified trust will need to receive information about the amount of income, if any, earned by the beneficiaries on assets that are not in the trust. To assist the independent trustee, the beneficiaries are permitted to send, on a quarterly basis, information about the amount of income they earned in that quarter on assets that are outside of the trust. This communication must be approved in advance by the Director in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Responsibilities of the independent trustee and other fiduciaries. (1) Any independent trustee or any other designated fiduciary of a qualified trust shall not knowingly and willfully, or negligently:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclose any information to an interested party or that party's representative with respect to the trust that may not be disclosed under title I of the Act, the implementing regulations or the trust instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquire any holding:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Directly from an interested party or that party's representative without

the prior written approval of the Director; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ownership of which is prohibited by, or not in accordance with, title I of the Act, the implementing regulations, the trust instrument, or with other applicable statutes and regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Solicit advice from any interested party or any representative of that party with respect to such trust, which solicitation is prohibited by title I of the Act, the implementing regulations, or the trust instrument; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fail to file any document required by the implementing regulations or the trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The independent trustee and any other designated fiduciary, in the exercise of their authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the trust, shall not consult or notify any interested party or that party's representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The independent trustee shall not acquire by purchase, grant, gift, exercise of option, or otherwise, without the prior written approval of the Director, securities, cash, or other property from any interested party or any representative of an interested party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certificate of Compliance. An independent trustee and any other designated fiduciary shall file, with the Director by May 15th following any calendar year during which the trust was in existence, a properly executed Certificate of Compliance in the form prescribed in appendix B to this part. In addition, the independent trustee and such fiduciary shall maintain and make available for inspection by the Office of Government Ethics, as it may from time to time direct, the trust's books of account and other records and copies of the trust's tax returns for each taxable year of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Responsibilities of the interested parties and their representatives. (1) Interested parties to a qualified trust and their representatives shall not knowingly and willfully, or negligently:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solicit or receive any information about the trust that may not be disclosed under title I of the Act, the implementing regulations or the trust instrument; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fail to file any document required by this subpart or the trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The interested parties and their representatives shall not take any action to obtain, and shall take reasonable action to avoid receiving, information with respect to the holdings and the sources of income of the trust, including a copy of any trust tax return filed by the independent trustee, or any information relating to that return, except for the reports and information specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of any qualified trust, the interested party shall, within thirty days of transferring an asset, other than cash, to a previously established qualified trust, file a report with the Director, which identifies each asset, categorized as to value in accordance with Sec. 2634.301(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any portfolio asset transferred to the trust by an interested party shall be free of any restriction with respect to its transfer or sale, except as fully described in schedules attached to the trust instrument, and as approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> During the term of the trust, the interested parties shall not pledge, mortgage, or otherwise encumber their interests in the property held by the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Amendment of the trust. The independent trustee and the interested parties may amend the terms of a qualified trust only with the prior written approval of the Director and upon a showing of necessity and appropriateness.</p>
