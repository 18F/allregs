                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the  provisions of this subpart apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each new and existing magnetic tape manufacturing operation  located at a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A magnetic tape manufacturing operation for which the owner or  operator chooses to use the provisions of Sec.  63.703(b) and (h) to  obtain a Federally enforceable limit on its potential to emit HAP.</p><p class="depth3">Explanatory Note: A reason the owner or operator would make the  choice described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is if the plant  site, without this limit, would be a major source. The owner or operator  could use this limit, which would establish the potential to emit from  magnetic tape manufacturing operations, in conjunction with the  potential to emit from the other HAP emission points at the stationary  source, to be an area source. Note, however, that an owner or operator  is not required to use the provisions in Sec.  63.703(b) and (h) to  determine the potential to emit HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart does not apply to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research or laboratory facilities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any coating operation that produces a quantity of magnetic tape  that is 1 percent or less of total production (in terms of total square  footage coated) from that coating operation in any 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The affected source subject to this standard is the magnetic  tape manufacturing operation, as defined in Sec.  63.702.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An owner or operator of an existing affected source subject to  the provisions of this subpart shall comply according to the following  schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 3 years after the effective date of the standard, if the  owner or operator is required to install a new add-on air pollution  control device to meet the requirements of Sec.  63.703(c) or (g); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 2 years after the effective date of the standard, if a  new add-on air pollution control device is not needed to comply with  Sec.  63.703(c) or (g) of these standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The compliance date for an owner or operator of a new affected  source subject to the provisions of this subpart is immediately upon  startup of the affected source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The provisions of this subpart apply during periods of startup  and shutdown, and whenever magnetic tape manufacturing operations are  taking place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Owners or operators of affected sources subject to the  provisions of this subpart shall also comply with the requirements of  subpart A as identified in Table 1, according to the applicability of  subpart A to such sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In any title V permit for an affected source, all research or  laboratory facilities that are exempt from the requirements of this  subpart shall be clearly identified.</p>
