The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which FSS licensees may relocate existing FS licensees using these frequencies to other frequency bands, media or facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FSS licensees may negotiate with FS licensees authorized to use frequencies in the 18.3-19.30 GHz bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the FS licensees would:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relocate their operations to other frequency bands, media or facilities; or alternatively</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accept a sharing arrangement with the FSS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FSS operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> FS operations in the 18.3-18.58 GHz band that remain co-primary under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(d), 78.18(a)(4) and 101.147(r) of this chapter will continue to be co-primary with the FSS users of this spectrum until November 19, 2012 or until the relocation of the fixed service operations, whichever occurs sooner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FS operations in the 18.3-18.58 GHz band that remain co-primary under the provisions of Sec.

Under the relocation procedures, the incumbent is required to relocate, provided that the FSS licensee meets the conditions of Sec. 101.91.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Negotiation periods are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year negotiation period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public safety incumbents will have a three-year negotiation period.
