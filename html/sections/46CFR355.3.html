                                Sec. 355.3  Criteria to be applied in support of stock data in affidavit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to  be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required  percentage of shares of stock of each class or series) in the Affidavit  as those observed for the primary corporation. If, on the other hand,  the ``fair inference rule'' is applied with respect to stock ownership  (see Collier Advertising Service, Inc. v. Hudson River Day Line, 14 Fed.  Supp. 335), the extent of U.S. citizen ownership of stock should be  ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 percent for foreign  operation and 95 percent for coastwise operation) in order that the  veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5)  may be relied upon by the Maritime Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When applying the fair inference rule (where there are more than  30 stockholders, except where one or more of such number actually owns  the controlling or 75 percent interest) in order to prove U.S. citizen  ownership in the required percentages (1) for foreign operation, 65  percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to  be held by persons with registered addresses within the United States to  prove that 51 percent or controlling interest is vested in citizens of  the United States and (2) for coastwise operation, 95 percent of the  shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by  persons having registered addresses within the United States to prove  that 75 percent of the interest in the corporation is vested in citizens  of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the primary corporation is consecutively owned by several  ``parent'' corporations (holders of 100 percent of the stock of each or  all classes or series of stock issued and outstanding), the facts should  be given in proper sequence either by chart or in narrative form,  revealing the facts of stock ownership. The information with respect to  the ultimate parent should include data relative to the basis upon which  controlling or 75 percent (depending upon whether the primary  corporation operates in the domestic or foreign commerce) is  established, together with the names of the owners of record or  beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of each class or series of stock,  if more than one class or series, and statement that such owners are  citizens of the United States. In any case where different classes or  series of stock exist, each class or series shall be treated depending  upon whether ``closely held'' or ``publicly held,'' individually in  applying the fair inference rule, if applicable, or giving the relevant  information with respect to United States citizens owning of record 51  percent or 75 percent of the interest.</p>
