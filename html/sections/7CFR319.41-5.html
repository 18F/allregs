                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The entry of the articles covered by Sec. 319.41-1 is  conditioned on their freedom from the European corn borer and other  injurious insects and plant diseases, and upon their freedom from   contamination with plant materials prohibited entry under other  quarantines. All shipments of these articles shall be subject to  inspection at the port of arrival by an inspector of the Plant  Protection and Quarantine Programs, in order to determine their freedom  from such insects and diseases and from contaminating materials, and to  such sterilization, grinding, or treatment in accordance with part 305  of this chapter, as the inspector may prescribe. Should an importation  be found on inspection to be so infested or infected or contaminated  that, in the judgment of the inspector, it can not be made safe by  sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this  chapter, the entire shipment may be refused entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When entry under sterilization or other treatment in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter is permitted, the importation will be  released to the permittee for such treatment, upon the filing with the  appropriate customs official of a bond in the amount of $5,000, or in an  amount equal to the invoice value, if such value be less than $5,000,  with approved sureties, and conditioned that the importation shall be  sterilized or otherwise treated under the supervision of the inspector;  that no bale or container shall be broken, opened, or removed from the  port of arrival unless and until a written notice is given to said  customs official by an inspector that the importation has been properly  sterilized or treated; and that the importation shall be redelivered to  said customs official within 30 days after its arrival.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Should a shipment requiring sterilization or other treatment in  accordance with part 305 of this chapter under the provisions of the  regulation in this subpart arrive at a port where facilities for such  sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this  chapter are not maintained, such shipment shall either be promptly  shipped under safeguards and by routing prescribed by the inspector to  an approved port where facilities for sterilization or other treatment  in accordance with part 305 of this chapter are available, or it shall  be refused entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of  articles enumerated in Sec. 319.41-1 are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Broomcorn. All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to  prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary  handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are  not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall  be subject to such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with  part 305 of this chapter as the inspector may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Articles made of broomcorn. Brooms or similar articles made of  broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture  involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the  included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such  articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and  of other injurious insects and plant diseases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shelled corn and other seeds. If shipments of shelled corn and  seeds of the other plants from countries other than those named in Sec.  319.41-1 (b)(2) are found upon inspection at the port of arrival to be  appreciably fouled with cobs or other portions of the plants the  inspector may require sterilization or other treatment in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter or may refuse entry.
