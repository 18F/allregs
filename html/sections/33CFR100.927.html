                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulated Area. The regulated area includes all U.S. navigable waters of the Maumee River, Toledo, OH, between a line starting from a point on land just north of the Cherry Street Bridge at position 41[deg]39[min]5.27[sec] N; 083[deg]31[min]34.01[sec] W straight across the river along the Cherry Street bridge to position 41[deg]39[min]12.83[sec] N; 083[deg]31[min]42.58[sec] W and a line extending from a point of land just south of International Park at position 41[deg]38[min]46.62[sec] N; 083[deg]31[min]50.54[sec] W straight across the river to the shore just south of the mouth of Swan Creek at position 41[deg]38[min]47.37[sec] N; 083[deg]32[min]2.05[sec] W (NAD 83).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Enforcement period. This section will be enforced annually on the third or fourth Saturday of July. The exact dates and times would be issued annually via a Notice of Enforcement. However, for 2014, this section will be enforced from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on July 19, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special Local Regulations. (1) The Coast Guard will patrol the regatta area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. Vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander and when so directed by that officer. Vessels will be operated at a no wake speed to reduce the wake to a minimum, in a manner which will not endanger participants in the event or any other craft and remain vigilant for event participants and safety craft. Additionally, vessels must yield right-of-way for event participants and event safety craft and must follow directions given by the Coast Guard's Patrol Commander. The rules contained in the above two sentences do not apply to participants in the event or vessels of the patrol operating in the performance of their assigned duties. Commercial vessels will have right-of-way over event participants and event safety craft. The races will stop for oncoming freighter or commercial traffic and will resume after the vessel has completed its passage through the regulated area. The Patrol Commander may direct the anchoring, mooring, or movement of any boat or vessel within the regatta area. A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander shall serve as a signal to stop. Vessels so signaled must stop and comply with the orders of the Patrol Commander. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both. The Patrol Commander may establish vessel size and speed limitations and operating conditions and may restrict vessel operation within the regatta area to vessels having particular operating characteristics. The Patrol Commander may terminate the marine event or the operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Coast Guard will patrol the regatta area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander.

The Patrol Commander will be aboard either a Coast Guard or Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel. The Patrol Commander may be contacted on Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) by the call sign ``Coast Guard Patrol Commander.''
