The Grantor may terminate the grant in whole, or in  part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever it is  determined that the Grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of  the grant. The grantee may appeal this decision in accordance with the  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Appeal Procedure  contained in subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.

The two parties shall agree upon the termination  conditions, including the effective date and, in case of partial  termination, the portion to be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedure for termination of grant for cause. FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall notify the Grantee in  writing of the determination and the reasons for and the effective date  of the whole or partial termination in accordance with 7 CFR 1900.53.</p><p class="depth0">18. Extension and/or revision of this grant agreement may be  approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  provided, in its opinion, the extention and/or revision is justified and  there is a likelihood that the Grantee can accomplish the goals set out  and approved in the application docket during the period of the  extension and/or revision as specified in 7 CFR 1944.538.</p><p class="depth0">Part C--Grantee agrees:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To comply with property management standards for expendable and  nonexpendable personal property established by Attachment N of OMB  Circular A-102 or Attachment N of 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA  through 2 CFR part 400 for State and local governments or nonprofit  organizations respectively. ``Personal property'' means property of any  kind except real property. It may be tangible--having physical  existence--or intangible-having no physical existence, such as patents,  inventions, and copyrights. ``Nonexpendable personal property'' means  tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year  and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A Grantee may use its  own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such  definition would at least include all tangible personal property as  defined above. ``Expendable personal property'' refers to all tangible  personal property other than nonexpendable personal property. When  nonexpendable tangible personal property is acquired by a Grantee with  project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but  shall vest in the Grantee subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Right to transfer title. For items of nonexpendable personal  property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reserve the right to  transfer title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by  the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under  existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following  standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or  otherwise made known to the Grantee in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall  issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of  the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 fails to issue disposition  instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the Grantee shall apply  the standards of paragraph 1(c) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be  subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property  discussed in paragraph 1(a)(iv) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or  to a third party and   the Grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the Grantee  shall be reimbursed by the benefitting Federal agency with an amount  which is computed by applying the percentage of the Grantee  participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to  the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable  shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of other tangible nonexpendable property for which the  Grantee has title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Grantee shall use the property in the project or program for  which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or  program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer  needed for the original project or program, the Grantee shall use the  property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in  the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Activities sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal  property is held for use on the project or program for which it was  acquired, the Grantee shall make it available for use on other projects  or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the  project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First  preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or  programs sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored  by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal  Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal  Government shall be permissible if authorized by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354. User charges should be considered if  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of other nonexpendable property. When the Grantee no  longer needs the property, the property may be used for other activities  in accordance with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonexpendable property with a unit acquisition cost of less than  $1,000. The Grantee may use the property for other activities without  reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain  the proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of  $1,000 or more. The Grantee may retain the property for other use  provided that compensation is made to FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be  computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost  of the original project or program to the current fair market value of  the property. If the Grantee has no need for the property and the  property has further use value, the Grantee shall request disposition  instructions from the original Grantor agency. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 shall determine whether the property can  be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists  within that agency, the availability of the property shall be reported,  in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Property Management  Regulations (FPMR) to the General Services Administration by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine whether a  requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue instructions  to the Grantee no later than 120 days after the Grantee request and the  following procedures shall govern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued  within 120 calendar days after the Grantee's request, the Grantee shall  sell the property and reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds  the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original  project or program. However, the Grantee shall be permitted to deduct  and retain from the Federal shares $100 or ten percent of the proceeds,  whichever is greater, for the Grantee's selling and handling expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the Grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other  than as described in paragraph 1(a)(iv) above, the Grantee shall be  reimbursed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for  such costs incurred in its disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable  personal property shall include the following procedural requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A description of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock  number, national stock number, or other identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sources of the property including grant or other agreement  number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Whether title vests in the Grantee or the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was  furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal  participation in the cost of the project or program for which the  property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the  Federal Government).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Location, use, and condition of the property and the date the  information was reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Unit acquisition cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales  price or the method used to determine current fair market value when a  Grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to  indicate Federal ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results  reconciled with the property records at least once every two years. Any  difference between quantities determined by the physical inspection and  those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine  the causes of the difference. The Grantee shall, in connection with the  inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need  for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate  safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss,  damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and  fully documented; if the property was owned by the Federal Government,  the Grantee shall promptly notify FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the  property in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When the Grantee is authorized or required to sell the property,  proper sales procedures shall be established which will provide for  competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible  return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Expendable personal property shall vest in the Grantee upon  acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of such property exceeding  $1,000 in total aggregate fair market value, upon termination or  completion of the grant and if the property is not needed for any other  federally sponsored project or program, the Grantee shall retain the  property for use on nonfederally sponsored activities, or sell it, but  must in either case compensate the Federal Government for its share. The  amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as  nonexpendable personal property.</p><p class="depth0">2. To provide a financial management system which will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial  results of each grant. Financial reporting will be on an accrual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Records which identify adequately the source and application of  funds for grant-supported activities. Those records shall contain  information pertaining to grant awards and authorizations, obligations,  unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays, and income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective control over and accountability for all funds,  property, and other assets. Grantee shall adequately safeguard all such  assets and shall assure that they are solely for authorized purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Accounting records supported by source documentation.</p><p class="depth0">3. To retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical  records, and all other records pertinent to the grant for a period of at  least three years after the submission of the final Project Performance  report pursuant to paragraph B(9)(c) of this agreement except in the  following situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If any litigation, claim, or audit is commenced before the  expiration of the three year period, the records shall be retained until  all litigations, claims, or audit findings involving the records have  been resolved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Records for nonexpandable property acquired with Federal funds  shall be retained for three years after final disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When records are transferred to or maintained by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the three year retention  requirement is not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Microfilm copies may be substituted in lieu of original records. The  Grantor and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of  their duly auhthorized representatives, shall have access to any books,  documents, papers, and records of the Grantee which are pertinent to the  specific grant program for the purpose of making audits, examinations,  excerpts, and transcripts.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Beyond the responsibilities of the State Office in the selection  of grantees and the administration of the program, and as stated in  Sec. 1944.502 of this subpart, the TSA program provides an opportunity  for the State Director to give priority to applicants serving the rural  areas of greatest need as well as use the program cooperatively with  other Federal and State agencies in addressing the housing needs of the  residents of a proposed TSA service area. Therefore, the State Office  should be prepared, before receipt of preapplications, to advise the  District Directors, potential applicants and other Federal and State  agencies which part(s) of the State has the greatest need for the TSA  program. The State Director should identify target areas in a similar  manner to the process used by the Administrator pursuant to  Sec. 1944.525 of this subpart. Proposals which are clearly inappropriate  and do not meet the basic priorities of Sec. 1944.529 (a) of this  subpart should not be encouraged due to the complexity of the  preapplication submission.</p><p class="depth0">D. In addition to the instructions of Sec. 1944.526 of this subpart,  the State Office should follow the procedures outlined below:</p><p class="depth0">1.

The State Office must provide written comments to be attached to  the preapplication(s) justifying the selection(s) and addressing the  items in Sec. 1944.529 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">5. The State Office will forward the original SF 424.1 and  accompanying documents of the selected preapplication(s) as quickly as  possible to the National Office, Attention: Special Authorities  Division, Multi-Family Housing. In no case should the State Office  forward their selected TSA preapplication(s) later than thirty (30) days  after the closing date for receipt of preapplications.</p><p class="depth0">6. Preapplications not selected by the State Office will be returned  to the applicants through the appropriate District Offices with notice  of appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0">7. In accordance with Sec. 1944.525 of this subpart, State Offices  will be advised of the number of preapplications to be submitted from  each state to the National Office.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sections 1944.531 and 1944.533 of this subpart detail the  responsibilities of the State Office after tentative selection or  concurrence of the TSA grantees by the National Office. Those  preapplicants not selected will be promptly notified and their  preapplication returned with notice of appeal rights. Form AD-622,  ``Notice of Preapplication Review Action,'' will be mailed from the  State Office to the applicants. District Offices will receive a copy  from the State Office.</p><p class="depth0">F.
