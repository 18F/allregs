                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transboundary movements of hazardous wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless they occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements must be executed by the exporter and the owner or operator of the recovery facility, and must specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the name and EPA ID number, where available, of paragraph (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The generator of each type of waste;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each person who will have physical custody of the wastes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each person who will have legal control of the wastes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The recovery facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify which party to the contract will assume responsibility for alternate management of the wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export. In such cases, contracts must specify that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person having actual possession or physical control over the wastes will immediately inform the exporter and the competent authorities of the countries of export and import and, if the wastes are located in a country of transit, the competent authorities of that country; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person specified in the contract will assume responsibility for the adequate management of the wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracts must specify that the importer will provide the notification required in Sec. 262.82(c) prior to the re-export of controlled wastes to a third country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contracts or equivalent arrangements must include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of any countries concerned, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth2">Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries do. It is the responsibility of the exporter to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, transporters or importers may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contracts or equivalent arrangements must contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Upon request by EPA, U.S. exporters, importers, or recovery facilities must submit to EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Information contained in the contracts or equivalent arrangements for which a claim of confidentiality is asserted in accordance with 40 CFR 2.203(b) will be treated as confidential and will be disclosed by EPA only as provided in 40 CFR 260.2.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (g):</p><p class="depth2">Although the United States does not require routine submission of contracts at this time, the OECD Decision allows Member countries to impose such requirements. When other OECD Member countries require submission of partial

or complete copies of the contract as a condition to granting consent to proposed movements, EPA will request the required information; absent submission of such information, some OECD Member countries may deny consent for the proposed movement.</p>
