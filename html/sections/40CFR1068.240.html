                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The prohibitions in Sec.  1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to a new engine if it is exempt under this section as a replacement engine. For purposes of this section, a replacement engine is a new engine that is used to replace an engine that has already been placed into service (whether the previous engine is replaced in whole or in part with a new engine).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. You are eligible for the exemption for new replacement engines only if you are a certificate holder. Note that this exemption does not apply for locomotives (40 CFR 1033.601) and that unique provisions apply to marine compression-ignition engines (40 CFR 1042.615).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section describe different approaches for exempting new replacement engines where the engines are specially built to correspond to an engine model from an earlier model year that was subject to less stringent standards than those that apply for current production (or is no longer covered by a certificate of conformity). You must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for any number of replacement engines you produce in excess of what we allow under paragraph (c) of this section. You must designate engines you produce under this section as tracked engines under paragraph (b) of this section or untracked engines under paragraph (c) of this section by the deadline for the report specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (e) of this section describes a simpler approach for exempting partially complete new replacement engines that are built under a certificate of conformity that is valid for producing engines for the current model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all the different approaches described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, the exemption applies only for equipment that is 40 years old or less at the time of installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Previous-tier replacement engines with tracking. You may produce any number of new engines to replace an engine already placed into service in a piece of equipment, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine being replaced must have been either not originally subject to emission standards or originally subject to less stringent emission standards than those that apply to a new engine meeting current standards. The provisions of this paragraph (b) also apply for engines that were originally certified to the same standards that apply for the current model year if you no longer have a certificate of conformity to continue producing that engine configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following requirements and conditions apply for engines exempted under this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must determine that you do not produce an engine certified to meet current requirements that has the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the equipment. If the engine being replaced was made by a different company, you must make this determination also for engines produced by this other company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of premature engine failure, if the old engine was subject to emission standards, you must make the new replacement engine in a configuration identical in all material respects to the old engine and meet the requirements of Sec.  1068.265. You may alternatively make the new replacement engine in a configuration identical in all material respects to another certified engine of the same or later model year as long as the engine is not certified with a family emission limit higher than that of the old engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For cases not involving premature engine failure, you must make a separate determination for your own product line addressing every tier of emission standards that is more stringent than the emission standards for the engine being replaced. For example, if the engine being replaced was built before the Tier 1 standards started to apply and engines of that power category are currently subject to Tier 3 standards, you must also consider whether any Tier 1 or Tier 2 engines that you produce have the appropriate physical and performance characteristics for replacing the old engine; if you produce a Tier 2 engine with the appropriate physical and performance characteristics, you must use it as the replacement engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You must keep records to document your basis for making the determinations in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An old engine block replaced by a new engine exempted under this paragraph (b) may be reintroduced into U.S. commerce as part of an engine that meets either the current standards for new engines, the provisions for new replacement engines in this section, or another valid exemption. Otherwise, you must destroy the old engine block or confirm that it has been destroyed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the old engine was subject to emission standards, the replacement engine must meet the appropriate emission standards as specified in Sec.  1068.265. This generally means you must make the new replacement engine in a previously certified configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, you must add a permanent label, consistent with Sec.  1068.45, with your corporate name and trademark and the following additional information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Add the following statement if the new engine may only be used to replace an engine that was not subject to any emission standards under this chapter:</p><p class="depth4">THIS REPLACEMENT ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.240. SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE AN UNREGULATED ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY. THIS ENGINE MAY NOT BE INSTALLED IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE THAN 40 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add the following statement if the new engine may replace an engine that was subject to emission standards:</p><p class="depth4">THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA EMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR [Identify the appropriate emission standards (by model year, tier, or emission levels) for the replaced engine] ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 1068.240. SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE A [Identify the appropriate emission standards for the replaced engine, by model year(s), tier(s), or emission levels)] ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY. THIS ENGINE MAY NOT BE INSTALLED IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE THAN 40 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Engines exempt under this paragraph (b) may not be introduced into U.S. commerce before you make the determinations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except as specified in this paragraph (b)(6). We may waive this restriction for engines excluded under paragraph (c)(5) of this section that you ship to a distributor. Where we waive this restriction, you must take steps to ensure that the engine is installed consistent with the requirements of this paragraph (b). For example, at a minimum you must report to us annually whether engines we allowed you to ship to a distributor under this paragraph (b)(6) have been placed into service or remain in inventory. After an engine is placed into service, your report must describe how the engine was installed consistent with the requirements of this paragraph (b). Send these reports to the

Designated Compliance Officer by the deadlines we specify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Previous-tier replacement engines without tracking. You may produce a limited number of new replacement engines that are not from a currently certified engine family under the provisions of this paragraph (c). If you produce new engines under this paragraph (c) to replace engines subject to emission standards, the new replacement engine must be in a configuration identical in all material respects to the old engine and meet the requirements of Sec.  1068.265. You may make the new replacement engine in a configuration identical in all material respects to another certified engine of the same or later model year as long as the engine is not certified with a family emission limit higher than that of the old engine. The provisions of this paragraph (c) also apply for engines that were originally certified to the same standards that apply for the current model year if you no longer have a certificate of conformity to continue producing that engine configuration. This would apply, for example, for engine configurations that were certified in an earlier model year but are no longer covered by a certificate of conformity. The following provisions apply to engines exempted under this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may produce a limited number of replacement engines under this paragraph (c) representing 0.5 percent of your annual production volumes for each category and subcategory of engines identified in Table 1 to this section (1.0 percent through 2013). Calculate this number by multiplying your annual U.S.-directed production volume by 0.005 (or 0.01 through 2013) and rounding to the nearest whole number. Determine the appropriate production volume by identifying the highest total annual U.S.-directed production volume of engines from the previous three model years for all your certified engines from each category or subcategory identified in Table 1 to this section, as applicable. In unusual circumstances, you may ask us to base your production limits on U.S.-directed production volume for a model year more than three years prior. You may include stationary engines and exempted engines as part of your U.S.-directed production volume. Include U.S.-directed engines produced by any parent or subsidiary companies and those from any other companies you license to produce engines for you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Count every exempted new replacement engine from your total U.S.-directed production volume that you produce in a given calendar year under this paragraph (c), including partially complete engines, except for the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engines built to specifications for an earlier model year under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Partially complete engines exempted under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer a report by March 31 of the year following any year in which you produced exempted replacement engines under this paragraph (c). In your report include the total number of replacement engines you produce under this paragraph (c) for each category or subcategory, as appropriate, and the corresponding total production volumes determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If you send us a report under this paragraph (c)(3), you must also include the total number of replacement engines you produced under paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section. You may include this information in production reports required under the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Add a permanent label as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For partially complete engines, you may alternatively add a permanent or removable label as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may not use the provisions of this paragraph (c) for any engines in the following engine categories or subcategories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Land-based nonroad compression-ignition engines we regulate under 40 CFR part 1039 with a per-cylinder displacement at or above 7.0 liters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Marine compression-ignition engines we regulate under 40 CFR part 1042 with a per-cylinder displacement at or above 7.0 liters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Locomotive engines we regulate under 40 CFR part 1033.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Partially complete engines. The following requirements apply if you ship a

partially complete replacement engine under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide instructions specifying how to complete the engine assembly such that the resulting engine conforms to the applicable certificate of conformity or the specifications of Sec.  1068.265. Where a partially complete engine can be built into multiple different configurations, you must be able to identify all the engine models and model years for which the partially complete engine may properly be used for replacement purposes. Your instructions must make clear how the final assembler can determine which configurations are appropriate for the engine they receive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must label the engine as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you have a reasonable basis to believe that the fully assembled engine will include the original emission control information label, you may add a removable label to the engine with your corporate name and trademark and the statement: ``This replacement engine is exempt under 40 CFR 1068.240.'' This would generally apply if all the engine models that are compatible with the replacement engine were covered by a certificate of conformity and they were labeled in a position on the engine or equipment that is not included as part of the partially complete engine being shipped for replacement purposes. Removable labels must meet the requirements specified in Sec.  1068.45.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you do not qualify for using a removable label in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you must add a permanent label in a readily visible location, though it may be obscured after installation in a piece of equipment. Include on the permanent label your corporate name and trademark, the engine's part number (or other identifying information), and the statement: ``THIS REPLACEMENT ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.240. THIS ENGINE MAY NOT BE INSTALLED IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE THAN 40 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION.''</p><p class="depth4">If there is not enough space for this statement, you may alternatively add: ``REPLACEMENT'' or ``SERVICE ENGINE.'' For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), engine part numbers permanently stamped or engraved on the engine are considered to be included on the label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Partially complete current-tier replacement engines. The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply for partially complete engines you produce from a current line of certified engines or vehicles. This applies for engine-based and equipment-based standards as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where engine-based standards apply, you may introduce into U.S. commerce short blocks or other partially complete engines from a currently certified engine family as replacement components for in-use equipment powered by engines you originally produced. You must be able to identify all the engine models and model years for which the partially complete engine may properly be used for replacement purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where equipment-based standards apply, you may introduce into U.S. commerce engines that are identical to engines covered by a current certificate of conformity by demonstrating compliance with currently applicable standards where the engines will be installed as replacement engines. These engines might be fully assembled, but we would consider them to be partially complete engines because they are not yet installed in the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emission credits. Replacement engines exempted under this section may not generate or use emission credits under the standard-setting part nor be part of any associated credit calculations.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec.   1068.240--Engine Categories and Subcategories for New</p><p class="depth2">Replacement Engines Exempted Without Tracking------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Standard-setting         Engine</p><p class="depth2">Engine category               part \1\          subcategories------------------------------------------------------------------------Highway CI......................  40 CFR part 86....  disp. < 0.6 L/cyl.</p><p class="depth2">0.6 <= disp. < 1.2</p><p class="depth2">L/cyl.</p><p class="depth2">disp. =</p><p class="depth2">1.2 L/cyl.</p><p class="depth2">Nonroad CI, Stationary CI, and    40 CFR part 1039,   disp. < 0.6 L/cyl.</p><p class="depth2">Marine CI.                        or 40 CFR part     0.6 <= disp. < 1.2</p><p class="depth2">1042.
