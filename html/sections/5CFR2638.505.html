                                Sec. 2638.505  Director's decision and order.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> will be  based on the Director's finding under Sec. 2638.504(e) that an ethics  violation has occurred or is occurring and reason to believe that the  violation is continuing. The procedures contained in this section do not  apply to findings or orders for action made to obtain compliance with  the financial disclosure requirements in title II of the Ethics Act. For  those findings and orders, the procedures contained in section 206 of  the Act shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. The employee will be served, personally or by United  States mail, with notice of proceedings to determine whether a violation  of an ethics provision is occurring and whether corrective action is  necessary to end the violation. A copy of the notice shall be provided  to the head of the employee's agency and the designated agency ethics  official thereof. The notice shall specify the employee's right to  present evidence or arguments either in writing or, at the employee's  written request, at a hearing conducted on the record. The notice shall  be signed by the Director and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief statement setting forth the basis for a possible ethics  violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where applicable, a copy of the Director's finding under  Sec. 2638.504(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the authority under which proceedings are to be  conducted, together with a copy of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date by which the employee must, by written notification to  the Director, elect to present evidence and arguments either at a  hearing or in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separation of functions. Once the Director has issued a notice  of proceedings and if the respondent employee has elected to have a  hearing conducted on the record, the General Counsel of the Office of  Government Ethics shall designate attorneys of the Office of Government  Ethics to participate on behalf of the Office in the proceedings,  including the investigation and presentation of the evidence at the  hearing. During this time period, the General Counsel of the Office of  Government Ethics shall serve as Advisor to the Director and will not  supervise Office of Government Ethics attorneys who are charged with the  investigation and presentation of the evidence in the pending matter. A  Deputy General Counsel shall supervise the Office attorneys responsible  for the investigation and presentation of the evidence during this time  period. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of  investigative or advocacy functions for the Office of Government Ethics  shall, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the  decision, recommended decision or Office review except as witness or  counsel in the proceedings. The Deputy General Counsel may request the  views or report of the designated agency ethics official of the  employee's agency when necessary to develop the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written submissions. Where the respondent employee elects to  submit evidence and arguments in writing, he will be given a period of  30 calendar days from the date of the notice within which to make a  submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hearings. If the respondent employee demands a hearing conducted  on the record, he will be given written notice of the time and place of  the hearing. The hearing will be convened within a reasonable period of  time and will be conducted on the record. An administrative law judge  who has been appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 shall act as the presiding  official at the hearing. Hearings will be as informal as may be  reasonably appropriate under all the circumstances. Evidence and  testimony, although not ordinarily admissible under rules of evidence,  may be received subject to the discretion of the administrative law  judge. Immaterial, irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence may be  excluded. The parties may stipulate as to any facts or testimony. The  testimony of witnesses shall be under oath and witnesses shall be  subject to cross-examination. The administrative law judge shall make  such   rulings with respect to the conduct of the hearings as circumstances may  require to ensure the orderly and expeditious presentation of evidence  in a manner fair to the parties and consistent with these regulations  and requirements of due process of law. The following procedures will  apply to the hearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conference. The respondent employee or the designated attorney  for the Office of Government Ethics may request, and the administrative  law judge, on his own initiative or in response to a request, may set a  prehearing conference for such purposes as the administrative law judge  deems necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public hearings. Hearings shall generally be open to the public.  However, the administrative law judge may order a hearing or any part  thereof closed, on his own initiative or upon motion of a party or other  affected person, where to do so would be in the best interests of  national security, the respondent employee, a witness, the public or  other affected persons. Unless specifically excluded by the  administrative law judge, the designated agency ethics official of the  employee's agency shall be permitted to attend a closed hearing. Any  order closing the hearing or any part thereof shall set forth the  reasons for the administrative law judge's decision. Any objections  thereto shall be made a part of the record. If a party or affected  person's request to close the hearing or any part thereof is denied by  the administrative law judge, that request shall be immediately  appealable to the Director and the hearing shall be held in abeyance  pending resolution of the appeal. The notice of appeal shall be filed in  writing, not to exceed 10 pages exclusive of attachments, with the  Director within 3 working days of the administrative law judge's denial  of the request. The Director shall provide an opportunity for an oral  hearing on the appeal conducted on the record and shall decide the  appeal within 3 working days following receipt of the notice of appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuances and delays. The authority to adjourn the hearing  shall rest with the administrative law judge. Continuances will be  allowed only for the most compelling reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hearing record. Testimony and arguments shall be recorded  verbatim and preserved for a reasonable period of time. When requested,  transcripts of the testimony and arguments and copies of all documentary  exhibits will be made available to the respondent employee upon the  payment of the reasonable costs thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Representation. A party is entitled to appear in person or by or  with counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Witnesses. The administrative law judge does not have the  authority to subpoena witnesses. However, the respondent employee and  the Office of Government Ethics may call witnesses whose testimony is  relevant and necessary to the proceedings. Witnesses who are to testify  or to produce documents in their official capacities will be assigned to  do so by their agencies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 6322 and will be paid  travel expenses under 5 U.S.C. 5702. Witnesses who are not Federal  employees may be issued invitational travel orders under 5 U.S.C. 5703  based on a determination by the administrative law judge that their  testimony is essential to the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Proof. The Office of Government Ethics has the burden of proof  to establish that the respondent employee is committing a violation of  an ethics provision and that corrective action is necessary to end the  violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Evidence. A party is entitled to present his case or defense by  oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to  conduct cross-examination. The respondent employee and the designated  attorney for the Office of Government Ethics may offer evidence,  arguments, testimony of witnesses, affidavits or sworn statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recommended decision. At the conclusion of the hearing, the  administrative law judge may request that the parties submit proposed  findings and conclusions within a reasonable period of time. After  receipt of the proposed findings and conclusions, if any, the  administrative law judge shall certify the entire record to the Director  for decision. When so certifying the record, the administrative law  judge shall   make a recommended decision that includes his written findings of fact  and conclusions of law with respect to material issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Decision and order. The Director's decision shall include  written findings and conclusions with respect to all material issues and  shall be supported by substantial evidence of record. The order shall  state the corrective action, if any, to be taken by the respondent  employee in order to remedy a violation of an ethics provision and shall  establish a reasonable period of time within which the respondent  employee must commence and complete the corrective action. A copy of the  decision and order shall be furnished to the respondent employee and to  the head of the agency and the designated agency ethics official, or  where the respondent employee is the head of an agency, to the  President.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preliminary to issuing a decision and order, the Director may  request that comments on the recommended decision be provided by the  designated agency ethics official of the employee's agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the respondent employee has elected to have a hearing  conducted on the record, the Director shall issue a decision and order  as soon as practicable following receipt of the certified record and the  administrative law judge's recommended decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the respondent employee has elected to make a written  submission under paragraph (d) of this section or has chosen to make no  submission and has not requested a hearing, the Director will issue a  decision and order as soon as practicable following receipt of all  materials of record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to the decision and order and any finding issued  under Sec. 2638.504(e), the record will include, where applicable, all  written submission under Sec. 2638.504(d) and Sec. 2638.505(d), a record  of the hearing, all documentary evidence introduced at the hearing, any  proposed findings and conclusions submitted by the parties and the  administrative law judge's recommended decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Compliance with the order. The respondent employee shall comply  with the Director's order by commencing and completing the corrective  action within the time specified in the order and by furnishing the  Director with satisfactory evidence of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice of noncompliance. Where the respondent employee fails to  comply with the Director's order within the time specified in the order,  the Director will provide the head of the respondent employee's agency  with written notice of the respondent employee's failure to comply.  Where the respondent employee is the head of the agency, the Director  shall submit such notification to the President.  [55 FR 1667, Jan. 18, 1990, as amended at 55 FR 21846, May 30, 1990]</p>
