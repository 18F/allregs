                                Sec. 21.122  Pyridine bases.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Alkalinity. One ml of pyridine bases dissolved in 10 ml of water  is titrated with 1 N H2SO4 until a drop of the  mixture placed upon Congo paper shows a distinct blue border, which soon  disappears. A minimum of 9.5 ml of the acid must be required for the end  point. (Congo paper: filter paper treated with 0.1 percent aqueous  solution of Congo red and dried.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distillation range. One hundred ml of the denaturant are  distilled in the following manner: The sample is placed in a short- necked glass flask of about 200 ml capacity which is rested on an  asbestos plate having a circular opening of 30 mm in diameter. The neck  of this flask is fitted with a fractionating tube 12 mm in diameter and  170 mm long and having a bulb just 1 cm below the side tube which is  connected with a Liebig condenser having a water jacket not less than  400 mm in length. A standardized thermometer is placed in the  fractionating tube so that the mercury bulb is suspended in the center  of the fractionating bulb. Heat is applied slowly and in such manner  that 5 ml of distillate is collected per minute in a graduated cylinder.  At least 50 ml must distill at or below 140 [deg]C. and at least 90 ml  below 160 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reactions. Dissolve 1 ml of pyridine bases in 100 ml of water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ten ml of this solution are treated with 5 ml of 5 percent  aqueous solution of anhydrous fused CaCl2 and the mixture  vigorously shaken. An abundant crystalline separation should occur  within 10 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ten ml of the pyridine solution mixed with 50 ml of Nessler's  reagent must give a white precipitate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Water content. Twenty ml of pyridine bases are shaken with 20 ml  of a caustic soda solution having a specific gravity of 1.40 (15.56  [deg]/15.56 [deg]C.) and the mixture allowed to stand until completely  separated into two layers. The amount of pyridine base layer should be  18.5 ml, minimum.  [T.D. ATF-133, 48 FR 24673, June 2, 1983. Redesignated by T.D. ATF-442,  66 FR 12854, Mar. 1, 2001]</p>
