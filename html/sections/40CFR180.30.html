                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under FFDCA section 408(h), judicial review is available in the  United States Courts of Appeal as to the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(f)(1)(C) requiring the  submission of data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on  objections to establishment, modification, or revocation of a tolerance  or exemption under FFDCA section 408(d)(4), or any regulation that is  the subject of such an order.

The underlying action here is the establishment, modification,  suspension, or revocation of a tolerance or exemption upon the  initiative of EPA including EPA actions pursuant to FFDCA sections  408(b)(2)(B)(v), 408(b)(2)(E)(ii), 408(d)(4)(C)(ii), 408(l)(4), and  408(q)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on  objections to the revocation or modification of a tolerance or exemption  under FFDCA section 408(f)(2) for noncompliance with requirements for  the submission of data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on  objections to rules issued under FFDCA sections 408(n)(3) and 408(d) or  (e) regarding determinations pertaining to State authority to establish  regulatory limits on pesticide chemical residues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on  objections to orders issued under FFDCA section 408(n)(5)(C) authorizing  States to establish regulatory limits not identical to certain  tolerances or exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any issue as to which review is or was obtainable under  paragraph (a) of this section shall not be the subject of judicial  review under any other provision of law. In part, this means that, for  the Agency actions subject to the objection procedure in FFDCA section  408(g)(2), judicial review is not available unless an adversely affected  party exhausts these objection procedures, and any petition procedures  preliminary thereto.
