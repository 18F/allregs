If a surgical  procedure has been performed to obtain a portion of a lung, the evidence  shall include a copy of the surgical note and the pathology report of  the gross and microscopic examination of the surgical specimen. If an  autopsy has been performed, a complete copy of the autopsy report shall  be submitted to the Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a miner who died prior to March 31, 1980, an  autopsy or biopsy report shall be considered even when the report does  not substantially comply with the requirements of this section. A  noncomplying report concerning a miner who died prior to March 31, 1980,  shall be accorded the appropriate weight in light of all relevant  evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A negative biopsy is not conclusive evidence that the miner does  not have pneumoconiosis. However, where positive findings are obtained  on biopsy, the results will constitute evidence of the presence of  pneumoconiosis.</p>
