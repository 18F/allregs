                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary may consider various criteria when determining whether  or not reasonable notice has been given by a live poultry dealer to a  poultry grower for suspension of delivery of birds. These criteria  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether a live poultry dealer provides a poultry grower written  notice at least 90 days prior to the date it intends to suspend delivery  of birds under a poultry growing arrangement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether the written notice adequately states the reason for the  suspension of delivery, the length of the suspension of delivery, and  the anticipated date the delivery of birds will resume; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether a catastrophic or natural disaster, or other emergency,  such as an unforeseen bankruptcy, has occurred that has prevented a live  poultry dealer from providing reasonable notice.
