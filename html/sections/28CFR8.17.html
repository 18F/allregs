                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following definitions, regulations, and criteria in this  subpart are designed to establish and implement procedures required by  section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law 100-690, 102  Stat. 4181. They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures  relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory  authority. These regulations do not affect the existing legal and  equitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property  seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested  parties from their existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing  their interests through such courses of action. These regulations are  intended to reflect the intent of Congress to minimize the adverse  impact on those entitled to legal or equitable relief occasioned by the  prolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violations  of law involving personal use quantities of controlled substances. The  definition of personal use quantities of a controlled substance as  contained herein is intended to distinguish between those small  quantities that are generally considered to be possessed for personal  consumption and not for further distribution, and those larger  quantities generally considered to be intended for further distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>  requires either that administrative forfeiture be completed within 21  days of the seizure of the property, or alternatively, that procedures  be established that provide a means by which an individual entitled to  relief may initiate an expedited administrative review of the legal and  factual basis of the seizure for forfeiture. Should an individual  request relief pursuant to these regulations and be entitled to the  return of the seized property, such property shall be returned  immediately following that determination, and in no event later than 20  days after the filing of a petition for expedited release by an owner,  and the administrative forfeiture process shall cease. Should the  individual not be entitled to the return of the seized property,  however, the administrative forfeiture of that property shall proceed.  The owner may, in any event, obtain release of property pending the  administrative forfeiture by submitting to the agency making the  determination property sufficient to preserve the Government's vested  interest for purposes of the administrative forfeiture.</p>
