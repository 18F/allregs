                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delivery under Article 14, UCMJ. When delivery of any member of the Navy or Marine Corps to the civilian authorities of a State is authorized, the member's commanding officer shall, before making such delivery, obtain from the Governor or other duly authorized officer of such State a written agreement. The State official completing the agreement must show that he is authorized to bind the State to the terms of the agreement. When indicating in the agreement the naval or Marine Corps activity to which the member delivered is to be returned by the State, care should be taken to designate the closest appropriate activity (to the command to which the member is attached) that possesses special court-martial jurisdiction. The Department of the Navy considers this agreement substantially complied with when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The member is furnished transportation (under escort in cases of delivery in accordance with Sec. 720.12) to a naval or Marine Corps activity as set forth in the agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The member is provided cash to cover incidental expenses en route thereto; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of the Navy is so informed.
As soon as practicable, a copy of the delivery agreement shall be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery under Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act. Special forms are used when delivering prisoners under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act. The Act is infrequently used and most requests are pursuant to Article 14, UCMJ. See Sec. 720.12 for a detailed discussion of the Detainers Act.</p>
