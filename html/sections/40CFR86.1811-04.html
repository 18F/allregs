This  section applies to 2004 and later model year LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs fueled  by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied  petroleum gas fuels, except as noted. Additionally, this section  contains provisions applicable to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and  zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). Multi-fueled vehicles must comply with  all requirements established for each consumed fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This section also applies to LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs of model years  prior to 2004, when manufacturers certify such vehicles to Tier 2  exhaust emission requirements to utilize alternate phase-in schedules,  as allowed under paragraph (k)(6) of this section, and/or to earn early  NOX credits for use in complying with the Tier 2 fleet  average NOX standard which takes effect in the 2004 model  year for LDV/LLDTs and 2008 for HLDT/MDPVs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except where otherwise specified, this section applies instead  of Secs. 86.1811-01, 86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, 86.1814-01, 86.1814-02,  86.1815-01, and 86.1815-02.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Except where otherwise specified, the provisions of this section  apply equally to LDVs and all categories of LDTs, and to all MDPVs.
