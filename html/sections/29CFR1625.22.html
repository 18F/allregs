In Title II of OWBPA, Congress addressed waivers of rights and claims under the ADEA, amending section 7 of the ADEA by adding a new subsection (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 7(f)(1) of the ADEA expressly provides that waivers may be valid and enforceable under the ADEA only if the waiver is ``knowing and voluntary''. Sections 7(f)(1) and 7(f)(2) of the ADEA set out the minimum requirements for determining whether a waiver is knowing and voluntary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other facts and circumstances may bear on the question of whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary, as, for example, if there is a material mistake, omission, or misstatement in the information furnished by the employer to an employee in connection with the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The rules in this section apply to all waivers of ADEA rights and claims, regardless of whether the employee is employed in the private or public sector, including employment by the United States Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Wording of Waiver Agreements. (1) Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the ADEA provides, as part of the minimum requirements for a knowing and voluntary waiver, that:</p><p class="depth0">The waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The entire waiver agreement must be in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver agreements must be drafted in plain language geared to the level of understanding of the individual party to the agreement or individuals eligible to participate. Employers should take into account such factors as the level of comprehension and education of typical participants. Consideration of these factors usually will require the limitation or elimination of technical jargon and of long, complex sentences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The waiver agreement must not have the effect of misleading, misinforming, or failing to inform participants and affected individuals. Any advantages or disadvantages described shall be presented without either exaggerating the benefits or minimizing the limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA, relating to exit incentive or other employment termination programs offered to a group or class of employees, also contains a requirement that information be conveyed ``in writing in a manner calculated to be understood by the average participant.'' The same standards applicable to the similar language in section 7(f)(1)(A) of the ADEA apply here as well.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(B) of the ADEA provides, as part of the minimum requirements for a knowing and voluntary waiver, that ``the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims under this Act.'' Pursuant to this subsection, the waiver agreement must refer to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) by name in connection with the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(E) of the ADEA requires that an individual must be ``advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waiver of future rights. (1) Section 7(f)(1)(C) of the ADEA provides that:</p><p class="depth0">A waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum . . . the individual does not waive rights or claims

that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The waiver of rights or claims that arise following the execution of a waiver is prohibited. However, section 7(f)(1)(C) of the ADEA does not bar, in a waiver that otherwise is consistent with statutory requirements, the enforcement of agreements to perform future employment-related actions such as the employee's agreement to retire or otherwise terminate employment at a future date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consideration. (1) Section 7(f)(1)(D) of the ADEA states that:</p><p class="depth0">A waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum * * * the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual already is entitled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Consideration in addition'' means anything of value in addition to that to which the individual is already entitled in the absence of a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a benefit or other thing of value was eliminated in contravention of law or contract, express or implied, the subsequent offer of such benefit or thing of value in connection with a waiver will not constitute ``consideration'' for purposes of section 7(f)(1) of the ADEA. Whether such elimination as to one employee or group of employees is in contravention of law or contract as to other employees, or to that individual employee at some later time, may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An employer is not required to give a person age 40 or older a greater amount of consideration than is given to a person under the age of 40, solely because of that person's membership in the protected class under the ADEA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time periods. (1) Section 7(f)(1)(F) of the ADEA states that:</p><p class="depth0">A waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual is given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the individual is given a period of at least 45 days within which to consider the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(G) of the ADEA states:</p><p class="depth0">A waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum . . . the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement, and the agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term ``exit incentive or other employment termination program'' includes both voluntary and involuntary programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The 21 or 45 day period runs from the date of the employer's final offer. Material changes to the final offer restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period; changes made to the final offer that are not material do not restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period. The parties may agree that changes, whether material or immaterial, do not restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The 7 day revocation period cannot be shortened by the parties, by agreement or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An employee may sign a release prior to the end of the 21 or 45 day time period, thereby commencing the mandatory 7 day revocation period. This is permissible as long as the employee's decision to accept such shortening of time is knowing and voluntary and is not induced by the employer through fraud, misrepresentation, a threat to withdraw or alter the offer prior to the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, or by providing different terms to employees who sign the release prior to the expiration of such time period. However, if an employee signs a release before the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, the employer may expedite the processing of the consideration provided in exchange for the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Informational requirements. (1) Introduction. (i) Section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA provides that:</p><p class="depth0">A waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum . . . if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the employer (at the commencement of the period specified in subparagraph (F)) [which provides time periods for employees to consider the waiver] informs the individual in writing in a manner calculated to

be understood by the average individual eligible to participate, as to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any class, unit, or group of individuals covered by such program, any eligibility factors for such program, and any time limits applicable to such program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the program, and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected for the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA addresses two principal issues: to whom information must be provided, and what information must be disclosed to such individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA references two types of ``programs'' under which employers seeking waivers must make written disclosures: ``exit incentive programs'' and ``other employment termination programs.'' Usually an ``exit incentive program'' is a voluntary program offered to a group or class of employees where such employees are offered consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individuals are already entitled (hereinafter in this section, ``additional consideration'') in exchange for their decision to resign voluntarily and sign a waiver. Usually ``other employment termination program'' refers to a group or class of employees who were involuntarily terminated and who are offered additional consideration in return for their decision to sign a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA references two types of ``programs'' under which employers seeking waivers must make written disclosures: ``exit incentive programs'' and ``other employment termination programs.'' Usually an ``exit incentive program'' is a voluntary program offered to a group or class of employees where such employees are offered consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individuals are already entitled (hereinafter in this section, ``additional consideration'') in exchange for their decision to resign voluntarily and sign a waiver. Usually ``other employment termination program'' refers to a group or class of employees who were involuntarily terminated and who are offered additional consideration in return for their decision to sign a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The question of the existence of a ``program'' will be decided based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. A ``program'' exists when an employer offers additional consideration for the signing of a waiver pursuant to an exit incentive or other employment termination (e.g., a reduction in force) to two or more employees. Typically, an involuntary termination program is a standardized formula or package of benefits that is available to two or more employees, while an exit incentive program typically is a standardized formula or package of benefits designed to induce employees to sever their employment voluntarily. In both cases, the terms of the programs generally are not subject to negotiation between the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Regardless of the type of program, the scope of the terms ``class,'' ``unit,'' ``group,'' ``job classification,'' and ``organizational unit'' is determined by examining the ``decisional unit'' at issue. (See paragraph (f)(3) of this section, ``The Decisional Unit.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A ``program'' for purposes of the ADEA need not constitute an ``employee benefit plan'' for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). An employer may or may not have an ERISA severance plan in connection with its OWBPA program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The purpose of the informational requirements is to provide an employee with enough information regarding the program to allow the employee to make an informed choice whether or not to sign a waiver agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To whom must the information be given. The required information must be given to each person in the decisional unit who is asked to sign a waiver agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The decisional unit. (i)(A) The terms ``class,'' ``unit,'' or ``group'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(i) of the ADEA and ``job classification or organizational unit'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(ii) of the ADEA refer to examples of categories or groupings of employees affected by a program within an employer's particular organizational structure. The terms are not meant to be an exclusive list of characterizations of an employer's organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> The terms ``class,'' ``unit,'' or ``group'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(i) of the ADEA and ``job classification or organizational unit'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(ii) of the ADEA refer to examples of categories or groupings of employees affected by a program within an employer's particular organizational structure. The terms are not meant to be an exclusive list of characterizations of an employer's organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The terms ``class,'' ``unit,'' or ``group'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(i) of the ADEA and ``job classification or organizational unit'' in section 7(f)(1)(H)(ii) of the ADEA refer to examples of categories or groupings of employees affected by a program within an employer's particular organizational structure. The terms are not meant to be an exclusive list of characterizations of an employer's organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When identifying the scope of the ``class, unit, or group,'' and ``job classification or organizational unit,'' an employer should consider its organizational structure and decision-making process. A ``decisional unit'' is that portion of the employer's organizational structure from which the employer chose the persons who would be offered consideration for the signing of a waiver and those who would not be offered consideration for the signing of a waiver. The term ``decisional unit'' has been developed to reflect the process by which an employer chose certain employees for a program and ruled out others from that program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> The variety of terms used in section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA demonstrates that employers often use differing terminology to describe their organizational structures. When identifying the population of the decisional unit, the employer acts on a case-by-

case basis, and thus the determination of the appropriate class, unit, or group, and job classification or organizational unit for purposes of section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA also must be made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The variety of terms used in section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA demonstrates that employers often use differing terminology to describe their organizational structures. When identifying the population of the decisional unit, the employer acts on a case-by-

case basis, and thus the determination of the appropriate class, unit, or group, and job classification or organizational unit for purposes of section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA also must be made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The examples in paragraph (f)(3)(iii), of this section demonstrate that in appropriate cases some subgroup of a facility's work force may be the decisional unit. In other situations, it may be appropriate for the decisional unit to comprise several facilities. However, as the decisional unit is typically no broader than the facility, in general the disclosure need be no broader than the facility. ``Facility'' as it is used throughout this section generally refers to place or location. However, in some circumstances terms such as ``school,'' ``plant,'' or ``complex'' may be more appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Often, when utilizing a program an employer is attempting to reduce its workforce at a particular facility in an effort to eliminate what it deems to be excessive overhead, expenses, or costs from its organization at that facility. If the employer's goal is the reduction of its workforce at a particular facility and that employer undertakes a decision-making process by which certain employees of the facility are selected for a program, and others are not selected for a program, then that facility generally will be the decisional unit for purposes of section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> However, if an employer seeks to terminate employees by exclusively considering a particular portion or subgroup of its operations at a specific facility, then that subgroup or portion of the workforce at that facility will be considered the decisional unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Likewise, if the employer analyzes its operations at several facilities, specifically considers and compares ages, seniority rosters, or similar factors at differing facilities, and determines to focus its workforce reduction at a particular facility, then by the nature of that employer's decision-making process the decisional unit would include all considered facilities and not just the facility selected for the reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following examples are not all-inclusive and are meant only to assist employers and employees in determining the appropriate decisional unit. Involuntary reductions in force typically are structured along one or more of the following lines:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facility-wide: Ten percent of the employees in the Springfield facility will be terminated within the next ten days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Division-wide: Fifteen of the employees in the Computer Division will be terminated in December;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Department-wide: One-half of the workers in the Keyboard Department of the Computer Division will be terminated in December;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Reporting: Ten percent of the employees who report to the Vice President for Sales, wherever the employees are located, will be terminated immediately;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Job Category: Ten percent of all accountants, wherever the employees are located, will be terminated next week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the examples in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, the decisional units are, respectively:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Springfield facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Computer Division;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Keyboard Department;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All employees reporting to the Vice President for Sales; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> All accountants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> While the particular circumstances of each termination program will determine the decisional unit, the following examples also may assist in determining when the decisional unit is other than the entire facility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A number of small facilities with interrelated functions and employees in a specific geographic area may comprise a single decisional unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a company utilizes personnel for a common function at more than one facility, the decisional unit for that function (i.e., accounting) may be broader than the one facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A large facility with several distinct functions may comprise a number of decisional units; for example, if a single facility has distinct internal functions with no employee overlap (i.e., manufacturing, accounting, human resources), and the program is confined to a distinct function, a

smaller decisional unit may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)(A)</em> For purposes of this section, higher level review of termination decisions generally will not change the size of the decisional unit unless the reviewing process alters its scope. For example, review by the Human Resources Department to monitor compliance with discrimination laws does not affect the decisional unit. Similarly, when a regional manager in charge of more than one facility reviews the termination decisions regarding one of those facilities, the review does not alter the decisional unit, which remains the one facility under consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of this section, higher level review of termination decisions generally will not change the size of the decisional unit unless the reviewing process alters its scope. For example, review by the Human Resources Department to monitor compliance with discrimination laws does not affect the decisional unit. Similarly, when a regional manager in charge of more than one facility reviews the termination decisions regarding one of those facilities, the review does not alter the decisional unit, which remains the one facility under consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> However, if the regional manager in the course of review determines that persons in other facilities should also be considered for termination, the decisional unit becomes the population of all facilities considered. Further, if, for example, the regional manager and his three immediate subordinates jointly review the termination decisions, taking into account more than one facility, the decisional unit becomes the populations of all facilities considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> This regulatory section is limited to the requirements of section 7(f)(1)(H) and is not intended to affect the scope of discovery or of substantive proceedings in the processing of charges of violation of the ADEA or in litigation involving such charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Presentation of information. (i) The information provided must be in writing and must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual eligible to participate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The information provided must be in writing and must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual eligible to participate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Information regarding ages should be broken down according to the age of each person eligible or selected for the program and each person not eligible or selected for the program. The use of age bands broader than one year (such as ``age 20-30'') does not satisfy this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In a termination of persons in several established grade levels and/or other established subcategories within a job category or job title, the information shall be broken down by grade level or other subcategory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If an employer in its disclosure combines information concerning both voluntary and involuntary terminations, the employer shall present the information in a manner that distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary terminations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the terminees are selected from a subset of a decisional unit, the employer must still disclose information for the entire population of the decisional unit. For example, if the employer decides that a 10% RIF in the Accounting Department will come from the accountants whose performance is in the bottom one-third of the Division, the employer still must disclose information for all employees in the Accounting Department, even those who are the highest rated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> An involuntary termination program in a decisional unit may take place in successive increments over a period of time. Special rules apply to this situation. Specifically, information supplied with regard to the involuntary termination program should be cumulative, so that later terminees are provided ages and job titles or job categories, as appropriate, for all persons in the decisional unit at the beginning of the program and all persons terminated to date. There is no duty to supplement the information given to earlier terminees so long as the disclosure, at the time it is given, conforms to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The following example demonstrates one way in which the required information could be presented to the employees. (This example is not presented as a prototype notification agreement that automatically will comply with the ADEA. Each information disclosure must be structured based upon the individual case, taking into account the corporate structure, the population of the decisional unit, and the requirements of section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA): Example: Y Corporation lost a major construction contract and determined that it must terminate 10% of the employees in the Construction Division. Y decided to offer all terminees $20,000 in severance pay in exchange for a waiver of all rights. The waiver provides the section 7(f)(1)(H) of the ADEA information as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The decisional unit is the Construction Division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All persons in the Construction Division are eligible for the program. All persons who are being terminated in our November RIF are selected for the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All persons who are being offered consideration under a waiver agreement must sign the agreement and return it to the Personnel Office within 45 days after receiving the waiver. Once the signed waiver is returned to the Personnel Office, the employee has 7 days to revoke the waiver agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The following is a listing of the ages and job titles of persons in the Construction Division who were and were not selected for termination and the offer of consideration for signing a waiver:
