                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Unless otherwise stated in subpart S, T, or any  other subpart of this part, the procedures described in this subpart are  available in all adjudicatory proceedings under the Shipping Act of  1984.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial disclosures. Except as otherwise stipulated or ordered  by the Commission or presiding officer, and except as provided in this  subpart related to disclosure of expert testimony, all parties must,  within 7 days of service of a respondent's answer to the complaint or  Order of Investigation and Hearing and without awaiting a discovery  request, provide to each other:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each  individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing  party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be  solely for impeachment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy, or a description by category and location, of all  documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that  the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may  use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely  for impeachment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of any damages claimed by the disclosing party who  must also make available for inspection and copying the documents or  other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from  disclosure, on which the estimate is based, including materials bearing  on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For parties served or joined later. A party that is first served  or otherwise joined after the answer is made must make the initial  disclosures within 5 days after an order of intervention is granted,  unless a different time is set by stipulation or order of presiding  officer. All parties must also produce to the late-joined party any  initial disclosures previously made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure of expert testimony. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A party must  disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use in  the proceeding to present evidence as an expert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Witnesses who are required to provide a written report. Unless  otherwise stipulated or ordered by the presiding officer, if the witness  is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the  proceeding or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve  giving expert testimony, the disclosure must be accompanied by a written  report, prepared and signed by the witness. The report must contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A complete statement of all opinions the witness will express  and the basis and reasons for them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The witness's qualifications, including a list of all  publications authored in the previous 10 years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A list of all other proceedings or cases in which, during the  previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert in a trial, an  administrative proceeding, or by deposition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and  testimony in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Witnesses who are not required to provide a written report.  Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the presiding officer, if the  witness is not required to provide a written report   under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the disclosure must state:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject matter on which the witness is expected to present  evidence as an expert; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is  expected to testify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Time to disclose expert testimony. The time for disclosure of  expert testimony must be addressed by the parties when they confer as  provided in paragraph (h) of this section and, if applicable, must be  included in the proposed discovery schedule submitted to the presiding  officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Scope of discovery and limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise limited by  the presiding officer, or as otherwise provided in this subpart, the  scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding  any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or  defense--including the existence, description, nature, custody,  condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and  the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable  matter. For good cause, the presiding officer may order discovery of any  matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant  information need not be admissible at hearing if the discovery appears  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on frequency and extent. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specific limitations on  electronically stored information. A party need not provide discovery of  electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies  as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion  to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom  discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably  accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the  presiding officer may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if  the requesting party shows good cause. The presiding officer may specify  conditions for the discovery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When required. On motion or on its own, the presiding officer  may limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by  these rules if the presiding officer determines that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,  or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less  burdensome, or less expensive;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain  the information by discovery in the action; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its  likely benefit, considering the needs of the proceeding, the amount in  controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at  stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving  the issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scope of discovery and limits--experts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party may depose  any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be  presented in a proceeding. If a report is required of the witness, the  deposition may be conducted only after the report is provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drafts of any report or disclosure required by these rules are  not discoverable regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Communications between the party's attorney and any expert  witness required to provide a report are not discoverable regardless of  the form of communications, except to the extent that the communications  relate to compensation for the expert's study or testimony; identify  facts or data that the party's attorney provided and that the expert  considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or identify  assumptions that the party's attorney provided and that the expert  relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A party may not by interrogatories or deposition discover facts  known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially  employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare  for a proceeding and who is not expected to be presented as a witness;  provided, however, that the presiding officer may permit such discovery  and may impose such conditions as deemed appropriate upon a showing of  exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party  to obtain facts or   opinions on the same subject by other means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Completion of discovery. Discovery must be completed within 150  days of the service of a respondent's answer to the complaint or Order  of Investigation and Hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duty of the parties to confer. In all proceedings in which the  procedures of this subpart are used, it is the duty of the parties to  confer within 15 days after receipt of a respondent's answer to a  complaint or Order of Investigation and Hearing in order to: establish a  schedule for the completion of discovery, including disclosures and  discovery related to experts, within the 150-day period prescribed in  paragraph (g) of this section; resolve to the fullest extent possible  disputes relating to discovery matters; and expedite, limit, or  eliminate discovery by use of admissions, stipulations and other  techniques. The parties must submit the schedule to the presiding  officer not later than 5 days after the conference. Nothing in this rule  should be construed to preclude the parties from conducting discovery  and conferring at an earlier date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conferences by order of the presiding officer. The presiding  officer may at any time order the parties or their attorneys to  participate in a conference at which the presiding officer may direct  the proper use of the procedures of this subpart or make such orders as  may be necessary to resolve disputes with respect to discovery and to  prevent delay or undue inconvenience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resolution of disputes. After making every reasonable effort to  resolve discovery disputes, a party may request a conference or rulings  from the presiding officer on such disputes. If necessary to prevent  undue delay or otherwise facilitate conclusion of the proceeding, the  presiding officer may order a hearing to commence before the completion  of discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Protective orders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A party or any person from  whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order. The motion  must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred  or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to  resolve the dispute without Commission or presiding officer action. The  Commission or presiding officer may, for good cause, issue an order to  protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or  undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Forbidding the disclosure or discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specifying terms, including time and place, for the disclosure  or discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by  the party seeking discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope  of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Designating the persons who may be present while the discovery  is conducted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on  Commission or presiding officer order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research,  development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed  only in a specified way; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified  documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the  Commission or presiding officer directs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ordering discovery. If a motion for a protective order is denied  in whole or in part, the Commission or presiding officer may, on just  terms, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Supplementing responses. A party who has made a disclosure under  paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, or who has responded to an  interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission, must  supplement or correct its disclosure or response:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In a timely manner if the party learns that in some material  respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if  the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made  known to the other parties during the discovery process or in written  communication; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As ordered by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Stipulations. Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, the  parties   may stipulate that other procedures governing or limiting discovery be  modified, but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery  must have presiding officer's approval if it would interfere with the  time set for completing discovery, for adjudicating a motion, or for  hearing. [Rule 201.]  [49 FR 44369, Nov. 6, 1984, as amended at 78 FR 45071, July 26, 2013]</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 80 FR 57307, Sept. 23, 2015, Sec.  502.201(c) was amended by removing the words ``five (5) days'' or ``five  days'' or ``5 days'' and adding, in their place, the words ``seven (7)  days'', effective Nov. 30, 2015.</p>
