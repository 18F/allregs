                                Sec. 660.721  Recreational fishing bag limits and filleting requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to recreational fishing for albacore tuna in  the U.S. EEZ off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington and for  bluefin tuna in the U.S. EEZ off the coast of California. In addition to  individual fishermen, the operator of a U.S. sportsfishing vessel that  fishes for albacore or bluefin tuna is responsible for ensuring that the  bag and possession limits of this section are not exceeded. The bag  limits of this section apply on the basis of each 24-hour period at sea,  regardless of the number of trips per day. The provisions of this  section do not authorize any person to take and retain more than one  daily bag limit of fish during 1 calendar day. Federal recreational HMS  regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state  recreational HMS regulations relating to federally-managed HMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Albacore Tuna Daily Bag Limit. Except pursuant to a multi-day  possession permit referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, a  recreational fisherman may take and retain, or possess onboard no more  than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ten albacore tuna if any part of the fishing trip occurs in the  U.S. EEZ south of a line running due west true from 34[deg]27[min] N.  latitude (at Point Conception, Santa Barbara County) to the U.S.-Mexico  border.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Twenty-five albacore tuna if any part of the fishing trip occurs  in the U.S. EEZ north of a line running due west true from  34[deg]27[min] N. latitude (at Point Conception, Santa Barbara County)  to the California-Oregon border.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bluefin Tuna Daily Bag Limit. A recreational fisherman may take  and retain, or possess on board no more than two bluefin tuna during any  part of a fishing trip that occurs in the U.S. EEZ off California south  of a line running due west true from the California--Oregon border  [42[deg]00[min] N. latitude].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Possession Limits. If the State of California requires a multi- day possession permit for albacore or bluefin tuna harvested by a  recreational fishing vessel and landed in California, aggregating daily  trip limits for multi-day trips would be deemed consistent with Federal  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Boat Limits Off the coast of California, boat limits apply,  whereby each fisherman aboard a vessel may continue to use recreational  angling gear until the combined daily limits of HMS for all licensed and  juvenile anglers aboard has been attained (additional state restrictions  on boat limits may apply). Unless otherwise prohibited, when two or more  persons are angling for HMS species aboard a vessel in the EEZ, fishing  may continue until boat limits are reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions on Filleting of Tuna South of Point Conception.  South of a line running due west true from Point Conception, Santa  Barbara County (34[deg]27[min] N. latitude) to the U.S.-Mexico border,  any tuna that has been filleted must be individually bagged as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bag must be marked with the species' common name; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fish must be cut into the following six pieces with all skin  attached: the four loins, the collar removed as one piece with both  pectoral fins attached and intact, and the belly cut to include the vent  and with both pelvic fins attached and intact.
