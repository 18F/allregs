For  longer absences, the PHA administrative plan establishes the PHA policy  on how long the family may be absent from the assisted unit. However,  the family may not be absent from the unit for a period of more than 180  consecutive calendar days in any circumstance, or for any reason. At its  discretion, the PHA may allow absence for a lesser period in accordance  with PHA policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Housing assistance payments terminate if the family is absent  for longer than the maximum period permitted. The term of the HAP  contract and assisted lease also terminate.</p><p class="depth2">(The owner must reimburse the PHA for any housing assistance payment  for the period after the termination.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Absence means that no member of the family is residing in the  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The family must supply any information or certification  requested by the PHA to verify that the family is residing in the unit,  or relating to family absence from the unit. The family must cooperate  with the PHA for this purpose.

The PHA absence policy includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How the PHA determines whether or when the family may be absent,  and for how long. For example, the PHA may establish policies on  absences because of vacation, hospitalization or imprisonment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any provision for resumption of assistance after an absence,  including readmission or resumption of assistance to the family.</p>
