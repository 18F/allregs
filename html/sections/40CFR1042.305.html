                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to prepare and test production-line  engines. You must assemble the test engine in a way that represents the  assembly procedures for other engines in the engine family. You must ask  us to approve any deviations from your normal assembly procedures for  other production engines in the engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test procedures. Test your production-line engines using the  applicable testing procedures in subpart F of this part to show you meet  the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this part. For  Category 1 and Category 2 engines, the not-to-exceed standards apply for  this testing of Category 1 and Category 2 engines, but you need not do  additional testing to show that production-line engines meet the not-to- exceed standards. The mode cap standards apply for the testing of  Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modifying a test engine. Once an engine is selected for testing  (see Sec.  1042.310), you may adjust, repair, prepare, or modify it or  check its emissions only if one of the following is true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You document the need for doing so in your procedures for  assembling and inspecting all your production engines and make the  action routine for all the engines in the engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart otherwise specifically allows your action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We approve your action in advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Engine malfunction. If an engine malfunction prevents further  emission testing, ask us to approve your decision to either repair the  engine or delete it from the test sequence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Setting adjustable parameters. Before any test, we may require  you to adjust any adjustable parameter on a Category 1 engine to any  setting within its physically adjustable range. We may adjust or require  you to adjust any adjustable parameter on a Category 2 or Category 3  engine to any setting within its specified adjustable range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may require you to adjust idle speed outside the physically  adjustable range as needed, but only until the engine has stabilized  emission levels (see paragraph (e) of this section). We may ask you for  information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We may specify adjustments within the physically adjustable  range or the specified adjustable range by considering their effect on  emission levels. We may also consider how likely it is that someone will  make such an adjustment with in-use engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Stabilizing emission levels. You may stabilize emission levels  (or establish a Green Engine Factor for Category 2 engines) before you  test production-line engines, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may stabilize emission levels by operating the engine in a  way that represents the way production engines will be used, using good  engineering judgment, for no more than the greater of two periods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 300 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of hours you operated your emission-data engine for  certifying the engine family (see 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, or the  applicable regulations governing how you should prepare your test  engine).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Category 2 or Category 3 engines, you may ask us to approve  a Green Engine Factor for each regulated pollutant for each engine  family. Use the Green Engine Factor to adjust measured emission levels  to establish a stabilized low-hour emission level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Damage during shipment. If shipping an engine to a remote  facility for production-line testing makes necessary an adjustment or  repair, you must wait until after the initial emission test to do this  work. We may waive this requirement if the test would be impossible or  unsafe, or if it would permanently damage the engine. Report to us in  your written report under Sec.  1042.345 all adjustments or repairs you  make on test engines before each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Retesting after invalid tests. You may retest an engine if you  determine an emission test is invalid under subpart F of this part.  Explain in your written report reasons for invalidating any test and the  emission results from all tests. If we determine that you improperly  invalidated a test, we may require you to ask for our approval for  future testing before substituting results of the new tests for invalid  ones.
