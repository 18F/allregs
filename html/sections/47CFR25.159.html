For purposes  of this paragraph, an applicant has an ``attributable interest'' in  another entity if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It holds equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or  nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the  aggregate, exceed thirty-three (33) percent of the total asset value  (defined as the aggregate of all equity plus all debt) of that entity,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section,  ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, i.e.,  all agreements, such as warrants, stock options, and convertible  debentures, will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder  already have been fully exercised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that a licensee misses three or more milestones  within any three-year period, the Commission will presume that the  licensee obtained one or more of those licenses for speculative  purposes. Unless the licensee rebuts this presumption, it will not be  permitted to apply for a GSO-like satellite or an NGSO-like satellite  system   in any frequency band if it has two or more satellite applications  pending, or two licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems of any kind. This  limit will remain in effect until the licensee provides adequate  information to demonstrate that it is very likely to construct its  licensed facilities if it were allowed to file more applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of this section, ``frequency band'' means one of  the paired frequency bands available for satellite service listed in  Sec. 25.202.
