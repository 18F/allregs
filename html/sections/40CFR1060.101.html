                                Sec.  1060.101  What evaporative emission requirements apply under this part?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Products subject to this part must meet emission standards and related requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 1060.102 describes permeation emission control requirements for fuel lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1060.103 describes permeation emission control requirements for fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 1060.104 describes running loss emission control requirements for fuel systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 1060.105 describes diurnal emission control requirements for fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following general requirements apply for components and equipment subject to the emission standards in Sec. Sec.  1060.102 through 1060.105:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustable parameters. Components or equipment with adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibited controls. The following controls are prohibited:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems so they cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems with features that disable, deactivate, or bypass the emission controls, either actively or passively. For example, you may not include a manual vent that the operator can open to bypass emission controls. You may ask us to allow such features if needed for safety reasons or if the features are fully functional during emission tests described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission credits. Equipment manufacturers are allowed to comply with the emission standards in this part using evaporative emission credits only if the exhaust standard-setting part explicitly allows it for evaporative emissions. See the exhaust standard-setting part and subpart H of this part for information about complying with evaporative emission credits. For equipment manufacturers to generate or use evaporative emission credits, components must be certified to a family emission limit, which serves as the standard for those components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This paragraph (f) specifies requirements that apply to equipment manufacturers subject to requirements under this part, whether or not they are subject to and certify to any of the emission standards in Sec. Sec.  1060.102 through 1060.105. Equipment manufacturers meeting these requirements will be deemed to be certified as in conformity with the requirements of this paragraph (f) without submitting an application for certification, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fuel caps, vents, and carbon canisters. You are responsible for ensuring that proper caps and vents are installed on each new piece of equipment that is subject to emission standards under this part. The following particular requirements apply to equipment that is subject to running loss or diurnal emission standards, including portable marine fuel tanks:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All equipment must have a tethered fuel cap. Fuel caps must also include a visual, audible, or other physical indication that they have been properly sealed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may not add vents unless they are specified in or allowed by the applicable certificates of conformity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the emission controls rely on carbon canisters, they must be installed in a way that prevents exposing the carbon to water or liquid fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel-line fittings. The following requirements apply for fuel-line fittings that will be used with fuel lines that must meet permeation emission standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use good engineering judgment to ensure that all fuel-line fittings will remain securely connected to prevent fuel leakage throughout the useful life of the equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel lines that are intended to be detachable (such as those for portable marine fuel tanks) must be self-sealing when detached from the fuel tank or engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refueling. For any equipment using fuel tanks that are subject to diurnal or permeation emission standards under this part, you must design and build your equipment such that operators can reasonably be expected to fill the fuel tank without spitback or spillage during the refueling event. The following examples illustrate designs that meet this requirement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Equipment that is commonly refueled using a portable gasoline container should have a fuel tank inlet that is larger than a typical dispensing spout. The fuel tank inlet should be located so the operator can place the nozzle directly in the fuel tank inlet and see the fuel level in the tank while pouring the fuel from an appropriately sized refueling container (either through the tank wall or the fuel tank inlet). We will deem you to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(i) if you design your equipment to meet applicable industry standards related to fuel tank inlets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Marine SI vessels with a filler neck extending to the side of the boat should be designed for automatic fuel shutoff. Alternatively, the filler neck should be designed such that the orientation of the filler neck allows dispensed fuel that collects in the filler neck to flow back into the fuel tank. A filler neck that ends with a horizontal

or nearly horizontal segment at the opening where fuel is dispensed would not be an acceptable design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Components and equipment must meet the standards specified in this part throughout the applicable useful life. Where we do not specify procedures for demonstrating the durability of emission controls, use good engineering judgment to ensure that your products will meet the standards throughout the useful life. The useful life is one of the following values:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The useful life in years specified for the components or equipment in the exhaust standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The useful life in years specified for the engine in the exhaust standard-setting part if the exhaust standards are specified for the engine rather than the equipment and there is no useful life given for components or equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Five years if no useful life is specified in years for the components, equipment, or engines in the exhaust standard-setting part.</p>
