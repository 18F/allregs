The requester shall articulate in sufficient  detail why the records are required so the custodian of the records may  make an informed decision regarding their release;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The intended use of the record generally relates to the purpose  for which the record is maintained; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Only those records as are minimally required to accomplish the  intended use are disclosed. The entire record is not released if only a  part of the record will be responsive to the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rank, position, or title alone does not authorize access to  personal information about others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disclosures required by the FOIA. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All records must be  disclosed if their release is required by FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552), as  implemented by 32 CFR part 286. The FOIA requires records be made  available to the public unless withholding is authorized pursuant to one  of nine exemptions or one of three law enforcement exclusions under the  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DoD Component must be in receipt of a FOIA request and a  determination made that the records are not withholdable pursuant to a  FOIA exemption or exclusion before the records may be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Records that have traditionally been released to the public by  the Components may be disclosed whether or not a FOIA request has been  received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The standard for exempting most personal records, such as  personnel, medical, and similar records, is FOIA Exemption 6 (32 CFR  part 286.12(e)). Under that exemption, records can be withheld when  disclosure, if other than to the individual about whom the information  pertains, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of the  individual's personal privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The standard for exempting personal records compiled for law  enforcement purposes, including personnel security investigation  records, is FOIA Exemption 7(C) (32 CFR part 286.12(g)). Under that  exemption, records can be withheld when disclosure, if other than to the  individual about whom the information pertains, would result in an  unwarranted invasion of the individual's personal privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If records or information are exempt from disclosure pursuant to  the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this  section, and the records are contained in a system of records (See  Sec. 310.10(a) of subpart B, the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) prohibits  release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Personal information that is normally releasable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DoD  civilian employees. (A) Some examples of personal information regarding  DoD civilian employees that normally may be released without a clearly  unwarranted invasion of personal privacy include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Present and past position titles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Present and past grades.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Present and past annual salary rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Present and past duty stations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Office and duty telephone numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Position descriptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All disclosures of personal information regarding Federal  civilian employees shall be made in accordance with OPM release policies  (see 5 CFR part 293.311).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Military members. (A) While it is not possible to identify  categorically information that must be released or withheld from  military personnel records in every instance, the following items of  personal information regarding military members normally may be  disclosed without a clearly unwarranted invasion of their personal  privacy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Full name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date of rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gross salary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Past duty assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Present duty assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Future assignments that are officially established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Office or duty telephone numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Source of commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Promotion sequence number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Awards and decorations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Attendance at professional military schools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Duty status at any given time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Home of record (identification of the state only).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Length of military service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Basic Pay Entry Date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Official Photo.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All disclosures of personal information regarding military  members shall be made in accordance with 32 CFR part 286.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Civilian employees not under the authority of OPM. (A) While  it is not possible to identify categorically those items of personal  information that must be released regarding civilian employees not  subject to 5 CFR parts 293, 294, and 297, such as nonappropriated fund  employees, normally the following items may be released without a  clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Full name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grade or position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date of grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gross salary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Present and past assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Future assignments, if officially established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Office or duty telephone numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All releases of personal information regarding civilian  personnel in this category shall be made in accordance with 32 CFR part  286.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When military or civilian personnel are assigned, detailed, or  employed by the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence  Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, or the National Geospatial- Intelligence agency, information about such personnel may only be  disclosed as authorized by Public Law 86-36 (``National Security Agency- Officers and Employees'') and 10 U.S.C 424 (``Disclosure of  Organizational and Personnel Information: Exemption for Specified  Intelligence Agencies''). When military and civilian personnel are  assigned, detailed or employed by an overseas unit, a sensitive unit, or  to a routinely deployable unit, information about such personnel may  only be disclosed as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 130b (``Personnel in  Overseas, Sensitive, or Routinely Deployed Units: Nondisclosure of  Personally Identifying Information'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Information about military or civilian personnel that otherwise  may be disclosable consistent with Sec. 310.22(b)(5) may not be  releasable if a requester seeks listings of personnel currently or  recently assigned/detailed/employed within a particular component, unit,  organization or office with the Department of Defense if the disclosure  of such a list would pose a privacy or security threat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosures for established routine uses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be  disclosed outside the Department of Defense pursuant to a routine use  that has been established for the system of records that contains the  records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A routine use shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be compatible with the purpose for which the record was  collected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the persons or organizations to whom the record may be  released;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify specifically the intended uses of the information by  the persons or organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Have been published in the Federal Register (see  Sec. 310.32(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a Federal statute or an E.O. of the President directs records  contained in a system of records be disclosed outside the Department of  Defense, the statute or E.O. serves as authority for the establishment  of a routine use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> New or altered routine uses must be published in the Federal  Register at least 30 days before any records may be disclosed pursuant  to the terms of the routine use (see subpart G of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In addition to the specific routine uses established for each of  the individual system notices, blanket routine uses have been  established (see appendix 3) that are applicable to all DoD system of  records. However, in order for the blanket routine uses to apply to a  specific system of records, the system notice shall expressly state that  the blanket routine uses apply. These blanket routine uses are published  only at the beginning of the listing of system notices for each  Component in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disclosures to the Bureau of the Census. Records in DoD systems  of records may be disclosed without the consent of the individuals to  whom they pertain to the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning  or carrying out a census survey or related activities pursuant to the  provisions of 13 U.S.C. 6 (``Information from other Federal Departments  and Agencies'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Disclosures for statistical research or reporting. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records  may be disclosed for statistical research or reporting but only after  the intended recipient provides, in writing, the purpose for which the  records are sought and assurances that the records will be used only for  statistical research or reporting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The records shall be transferred to the requester in a form that  is not individually identifiable. DoD Components disclosing records  under this provision are required to assure information being disclosed  cannot reasonably be used in any way to make determinations about  individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The records will not be used, in whole or in part, to make any  determination about the rights, benefits, or entitlements of specific  individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The written statement by the requester shall be made part of the  Component's accounting of disclosures (See paragraph (a) of 310.25).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA), General Services Administration (GSA). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be  disclosed to the NARA if they:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Have historical or other value to warrant continued  preservation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For evaluation by the Archivist of the United States, or his or  her designee, to determine if a record has such historical or other  value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Records transferred to a Federal Records Center (FRC) for  safekeeping and storage do not fall within this category. These records  are owned by the Component and remain under the control of the  transferring Component. FRC personnel are considered agents of the  Component that retains control over the records. No disclosure  accounting is required for the transfer of records to the FRCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disclosures for law enforcement purposes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be  disclosed to another Agency or an instrumentality of any Governmental  jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a  civil or criminal law enforcement activity, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The civil or criminal law enforcement activity is authorized by  law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The head of the law enforcement activity or a designee has made  a written request specifying the particular records desired and the law  enforcement purpose (such as criminal investigations, enforcement of a  civil law, or a similar purpose) for which the record is sought; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is no Federal statute that prohibits the disclosure of  the records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Blanket requests for any and all records pertaining to an  individual shall not be honored absent justification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a record is released to a law enforcement activity under  this subparagraph, the disclosure accounting (see Sec. 310.25) for the  release shall not be made available to the individual to whom the record  pertains if the law enforcement activity requests that the disclosure  not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The blanket routine use for law enforcement (appendix C, section  A) applies to all DoD Component systems notices (see paragraph (b)(6) of  this section). This permits Components, on their own initiative, to  report indications of violations of law found in a system of records to  a law enforcement activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disclosures may be made to Federal, State, or local, but not  foreign law enforcement agencies. Disclosures to Foreign law enforcement  agencies may be made if a routine use has been established for the  system of records from which the records are to be released.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Emergency disclosures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be disclosed if  disclosure is made under compelling circumstances affecting the health  or safety of any individual. The affected individual need not be the  subject of the record disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When such a disclosure is made, the Component shall notify the  individual who is the subject of the record. Notification sent to the  last known address of the individual as known to the Component is  sufficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The specific data to be disclosed is at the discretion of the  Component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Emergency medical information may be released by telephone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclosures to Congress. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be disclosed to either  House of the Congress or to any committee, joint committee or  subcommittee of Congress if the release pertains to a matter within the  jurisdiction of the committee. Disclosure is only authorized when in  response to an official request on behalf of either House, committee,  subcommittee, or joint committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests from members of Congress who are seeking records in  their individual capacity or on behalf of a constituent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requests made in their individual capacity. Request for records  shall be processed under the provisions of DoD 5400.7-R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requests made on behalf of constituents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The blanket routine use for ``Congressional Inquiries'' (see  appendix C, section D) applies to all systems. When an individual  requests the assistance of the Congressional member, the   blanket routine use permits the disclosure of records pertaining to the  individual without the express written consent of the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If necessary, accept constituent letters requesting a member of  Congress to investigate a matter pertaining to the individual as written  authorization to provide access to the records to the congressional  member or his or her staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When a Congressional inquiry indicates that the request is being  made on the basis of a request from the individual to whom the record  pertains, consent can be inferred even if the constituent request is not  provided the Component. The verbal statement by a Congressional staff  member is acceptable to establish that a request has been received by  the Member of Congress from the person to whom the records pertain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the constituent inquiry is being made on behalf of someone  other than the individual to whom the record pertains, the Member of  Congress shall be provided only that information releasable under DoD  5400.7-R. Advise the Congressional member that the written consent of  the individual to whom the record pertains is required before any  additional information may be disclosed. Do not contact individuals to  obtain their consents for release to Congressional members unless a  Congressional office specifically requests that this be done.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Nothing in paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(A) of this section prohibits a  Component, when appropriate, from providing the record directly to the  individual and notifying the Congressional office that this has been  done without providing the record to the Congressional member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> See paragraph (e) of Sec. 310.20 for the policy on assessing  fees for Members of Congress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Make a disclosure accounting each time a record is disclosed to  either House of Congress, to any committee, joint committee, or  subcommittee of Congress, or to any congressional member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Disclosures to the General Accountability Office. Records may be  disclosed to the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized  representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the  General Accountability Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Disclosures under court orders. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records may be disclosed  without the consent of the person to whom they pertain under a court  order signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a record is disclosed under this provision, make reasonable  efforts to notify the individual to whom the record pertains, if the  legal process is a matter of public record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the process is not a matter of public record at the time it  is issued, seek information as to when the process is to be made public  and make reasonable efforts to notify the individual at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notification sent to the last known address of the individual as  reflected in the records is considered a reasonable effort to notify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Make a disclosure accounting each time a record is disclosed  under a court order or compulsory legal process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Disclosures to consumer reporting agencies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain personal  information may be disclosed to consumer reporting agencies as provided  in the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under the provisions of paragraph (l)(1) of this section, the  following information may be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, taxpayer identification number (SSN), and other  information necessary to establish the identity of the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount, status, and history of the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Agency or program under which the claim arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711(e)) requires  the system notice for the system of records from which the information  will be disclosed, indicates that the information may be disclosed to a  consumer reporting agency.</p>
