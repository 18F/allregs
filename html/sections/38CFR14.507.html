Advice, recommendations, or conclusions on matters  of Government or Department policy, contained within a written legal  opinion, shall not be binding on Department officials and employees  merely because of their being contained within a written legal opinion.  Written legal opinions will be maintained in the Office of the General  Counsel. Written legal opinions involving veterans' benefits under laws  administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which pertain to a  particular benefit matter, in addition to being maintained in the Office  of the General Counsel, will be filed in the individual claim folder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A written legal opinion of the General Counsel involving  veterans' benefits under laws administered by the Department of Veterans  Affairs which, in the judgment of the General Counsel or the Deputy  General Counsel acting as or for the General Counsel, necessitates  regulatory change, interprets a statute or regulation as a matter of  first impression, clarifies or modifies a prior opinion, or is otherwise  of significance beyond the matter at issue, may be designated a  ``precedent opinion'' for purposes of such benefits. Written legal  opinions designated as precedent opinions under this section shall be  considered by Department of Veterans Affairs to be subject to the  provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1). An opinion designated as a precedent  opinion is binding on Department officials and employees in subsequent  matters involving a legal issue decided in the precedent opinion, unless  there has been a material change in a controlling statute or regulation  or the opinion has been overruled or modified by a subsequent precedent  opinion or judicial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, the term written legal opinion of  the General Counsel means a typed or printed   memorandum or letter signed by the General Counsel or by the Deputy  General Counsel acting as or for the General Counsel, addressed to an  official or officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs stating a  conclusion on a legal issue pertaining to Department of Veterans Affairs  activities.
