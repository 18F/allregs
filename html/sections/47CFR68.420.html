                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where it appears from the defendant's answer, or from other communications with the parties, that an informal complaint has been satisfied, the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau on delegated authority may, in its discretion, consider the informal complaint closed, without response to the complainant or defendant. In all other cases, the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau shall inform the parties of its review and disposition of a complaint filed under this subpart. Where practicable, this information (the nature of which is specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, shall be transmitted to the complainant and defendant in the manner requested by the complainant, (e.g., letter, facsimile transmission, telephone (voice/TRS/TTY), Internet e-mail, ASCII text, audio-cassette recording, or Braille).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event the Commission or the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau determines, based on a review of the information provided in the informal complaint and the defendant's answer thereto, that no further action is required by the Commission or the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau with respect to the allegations contained in the informal complaint, the informal complaint shall be closed and the complainant and defendant shall be duly informed of the reasons therefor. A complainant, unsatisfied with the defendant's response to the informal complaint and the staff decision to terminate action on the informal complaint, may file a complaint with the Commission or the Enforcement Bureau as specified in Sec. Sec. 68.400 through 68.412.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau on delegated authority determines, based

on a review of the information presented in the informal complaint and the defendant's answer thereto, that a material and substantial question remains as to the defendant's compliance with the requirements of this subpart, the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau may conduct such further investigation or such further proceedings as may be necessary to determine the defendant's compliance with the requirements of this subpart and to determine what, if any, remedial actions and/or sanctions are warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau on delegated authority determines, based on a review of the information presented in the informal complaint and the defendant's answer thereto, that the defendant has failed to comply with or is presently not in compliance with the requirements of this subpart, the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau on delegated authority may order or prescribe such remedial actions and/or sanctions as are authorized under the Act and the Commission's rules and which are deemed by the Commission or the Consumer Information Bureau on delegated authority to be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.
