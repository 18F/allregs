                                Sec. 1.1232-1  Bonds and other evidences of indebtedness;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and the regulations thereunder.  Section 1232(c) treats as ordinary income a portion of any gain realized  upon the disposition of (i) coupon obligations which were acquired   after August 16, 1954, and before January 1, 1958, without all coupons  maturing more than 12 months after purchase attached, and (ii) coupon  obligations which were acquired after December 31, 1957, without all  coupons maturing after the date of purchase attached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirement that obligations be capital assets. In order for  section 1232 to be applicable, an obligation must be a capital asset in  the hands of the taxpayer. See section 1221 and the regulations  thereunder. Obligations held by a dealer in securities (except as  provided in section 1236) or obligations arising from the sale of  inventory or personal services by the holder are not capital assets.  However, obligations held by a financial institution, as defined in  section 582(c) (relating to treatment of losses and gains on bonds of  certain financial institutions) for investment and not primarily for  sale to customers in the ordinary course of the financial institution's  trade or business, are capital assets. Thus, with respect ot obligations  held as capital assets by such a financial institution which are  corporate obligations to which section 1232(a)(3) applies, there is  ratable inclusion of original issue discount as interest in gross income  under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1232-3A, and gain on a sale or exchange  (including retirement) may be subject to ordinary income treatment under  section 582(c) and paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.1232-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Face-amount certificates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  section 1232, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4, the  term other evidence of indebtedness includes face amount certificates as  defined in section 2(a)(15) and 4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940  (15 U.S.C. 80a-2 and 80a-4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts received in taxable years beginning prior to January 1,  1964. Amounts received in taxable years beginning prior to January 1,  1964 under face amount certificates which were issued after December 31,  1954, are subject to the limitation on tax under section 72(e)(3). See  paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.72-11 (relating to limit on tax attributable to  receipt of a lump sum received as an annuity payment). However, section  72(e)(3) does not apply to any such amounts received in taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1963.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(A)</em> as consideration paid  for purposes of computing the investment in the contract under section  72, see Sec. 1.72-6(c)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain deposits in financial institutions. For purposes of  section 1232, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4, the  term other evidence of indebtedness includes certificates of deposit,  time deposits, bonus plans, and other deposit arrangements with banks,  domestic building and loan associations, and similar financial  institutions. For application of section 1232 to such deposits, see  paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1232-3A. However, section 1232, this section,  and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4 shall not apply to such  deposits made prior to January 1, 1971. For treatment of renewable  certificates of deposit, see paragraph (e)(4) of Sec. 1.1232-3A.
