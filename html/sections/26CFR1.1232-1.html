                                Sec. 1.1232-1  Bonds and other evidences of indebtedness;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 1232 applies to any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness (referred to in this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4 as an obligation) (1) which is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer, and (2) which is issued by any corporation, or by any government or political subdivision thereof. In general, section 1232(a)(1) provides that the retirement of an obligation, other than certain obligations issued before January 1, 1955, is considered to be an exchange and, therefore, is usually subject to capital gain or loss treatment. In general, section 1232(a)(2)(B) provides that in the case of a gain realized on the sale or exchange of certain obligations issued at a discount after December 31, 1954, which are either corporate bonds issued on or before May 27, 1969, or government bonds, the amount of gain equal to such discount or, under certain circumstances, the amount of gain equal to a specified portion of such discount, constitutes ordinary income. In the case of certain corporate obligations issued after May 27, 1969, in general, section 1232(a)(3) provides for the inclusion as interest in gross income of a ratable portion of original issue discount for each taxable year over the life of the obligation, section 1232(a)(3)(E) provides for an increase in basis equal to the original issue discount included in gross income, and section 1232(a)(2)(A) provides that any gain realized on such an obligation held more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) shall be considered gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977). For the requirements for reporting original issue discount on certain obligations issued after May 27, 1969, see section 6049(a) and the regulations thereunder. Section 1232(c) treats as ordinary income a portion of any gain realized upon the disposition of (i) coupon obligations which were acquired

after August 16, 1954, and before January 1, 1958, without all coupons maturing more than 12 months after purchase attached, and (ii) coupon obligations which were acquired after December 31, 1957, without all coupons maturing after the date of purchase attached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirement that obligations be capital assets. In order for section 1232 to be applicable, an obligation must be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. See section 1221 and the regulations thereunder. Obligations held by a dealer in securities (except as provided in section 1236) or obligations arising from the sale of inventory or personal services by the holder are not capital assets. However, obligations held by a financial institution, as defined in section 582(c) (relating to treatment of losses and gains on bonds of certain financial institutions) for investment and not primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the financial institution's trade or business, are capital assets. Thus, with respect ot obligations held as capital assets by such a financial institution which are corporate obligations to which section 1232(a)(3) applies, there is ratable inclusion of original issue discount as interest in gross income under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1232-3A, and gain on a sale or exchange (including retirement) may be subject to ordinary income treatment under section 582(c) and paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.1232-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Face-amount certificates--(1) In general. For purposes of section 1232, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4, the term other evidence of indebtedness includes face amount certificates as defined in section 2(a)(15) and 4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2 and 80a-4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 1232, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4, the term other evidence of indebtedness includes face amount certificates as defined in section 2(a)(15) and 4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2 and 80a-4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts received in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1964. Amounts received in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1964 under face amount certificates which were issued after December 31, 1954, are subject to the limitation on tax under section 72(e)(3). See paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.72-11 (relating to limit on tax attributable to receipt of a lump sum received as an annuity payment). However, section 72(e)(3) does not apply to any such amounts received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certificates issued after December 31, 1975. In the case of a face-amount certificate issued after December 31, 1975 (other than such a certificate issued pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on such date and at all times thereafter), the provisions of section 1232(a)(3) (relating to the ratable inclusion of original issue discount in gross income) shall apply. See section 1232-3A(f). For treatment of any increase in basis under section 1232(a)(3)(A) as consideration paid for purposes of computing the investment in the contract under section 72, see Sec. 1.72-6(c)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain deposits in financial institutions. For purposes of section 1232, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4, the term other evidence of indebtedness includes certificates of deposit, time deposits, bonus plans, and other deposit arrangements with banks, domestic building and loan associations, and similar financial institutions. For application of section 1232 to such deposits, see paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1232-3A. However, section 1232, this section, and Sec. Sec. 1.1232-2 through 1.1232-4 shall not apply to such deposits made prior to January 1, 1971. For treatment of renewable certificates of deposit, see paragraph (e)(4) of Sec. 1.1232-3A.
