                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ODNI exempts the following system of records from the  requirements of subsections (c)(3); (d)(1), (2), (3), (4); (e)(1);  (e)(4)(G), (H), (I); and (f) of the Privacy Act, to the extent that  information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to  subsections (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Act:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ONCIX Counterintelligence Damage Assessment Records (ODNI/ONCIX- 001).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) (accounting of disclosures) because an  accounting of disclosures from records concerning the record subject  would specifically reveal an investigative interest on the part of the  ODNI as well as the recipient agency and could: result in release of  properly classified national security or foreign policy information;  compromise ongoing efforts to investigate a known or suspected  terrorist; reveal sensitive investigative or surveillance techniques; or  identify a confidential source. With this information, the record  subject could frustrate counterintelligence measures; impede an  investigation by destroying evidence or intimidating potential  witnesses; endanger the physical safety of sources, witnesses, and law  enforcement and intelligence personnel and their families; or evade  apprehension or prosecution by law enforcement personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3) and (4) (record subject's  right to access and amend records) because these provisions concern  individual access to and amendment of counterterrorism, investigatory  and intelligence records. Affording access and amendment rights could  alert the record subject to the fact and nature of an investigation or  the investigative interest of intelligence or law enforcement agencies;  permit the subject to frustrate such investigation, surveillance or  potential prosecution; compromise sensitive information classified in  the interest of national security; identify a confidential source or  disclose information which would reveal a sensitive investigative or  intelligence technique; and endanger the health or safety of law  enforcement personnel, confidential informants, and witnesses. In  addition, affording subjects access and amendment rights would impose an  impossible administrative burden to continuously reexamine  investigations, analyses, and reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (e)(1) (maintain only relevant and necessary  records) because it is not always possible to know in advance what  information will be relevant to evaluate and mitigate damage to the  national security. Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and  timing, and only after information is evaluated can relevance and  necessity be established. In addition, information in the system of  records may relate to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of  another agency, and may not readily be segregated. Furthermore,  information in these systems of records, over time, aid in establishing  patterns of criminal activity that can provide leads for other law  enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(G)</em> and (H) (publication of procedures  for notifying subjects to the existence of records about them and how  they may access records and contest contents) because the system is  exempted from subsection (d) provisions regarding access and amendment  and from the subsection (f) requirement to promulgate agency rules.  Nevertheless, the ODNI has published notice concerning notification,  access, and contest procedures because it may in certain circumstances  determine it appropriate to provide subjects access to all or a portion  of the records about them in a system of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (e)(4)(I) (identifying sources of records in the  system of records) because identifying sources could result in  disclosure of properly classified national defense or foreign policy  information. Additionally, exemption from this provision is necessary to  protect the privacy and safety of witnesses and sources of information,  including intelligence sources and methods and investigatory techniques  and procedures. Notwithstanding its proposed exemption from this  requirement, ODNI identifies record sources in broad categories  sufficient to provide general notice of the origins of the information  it maintains in its systems of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (f) (agency rules for notifying subjects to the  existence of records about them, for accessing and amending records and  for assessing fees) because the system is exempt from subsection (d)  provisions regarding access and amendment of records by record subjects.  Nevertheless, the ODNI has published agency rules concerning  notification of a subject in response to his request if any system of  records named by the subject contains a record pertaining to him and  procedures by which the subject may access or amend the records.  Notwithstanding exemption, the ODNI may determine it appropriate to  satisfy a record subject's access request.</p>
