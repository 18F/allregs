                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person (an entity of any type covered under 1 U.S.C. 1,  including but not limited to the following: A railroad; a manager,  supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any  owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or  facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a  railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee,  or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this part or  causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil  penalty of at least $650 and not more than $25,000 per violation, except  that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful  violations; where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated  violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury, or has  caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $105,000 per violation  may be assessed; and the standard of liability for a railroad will vary  depending upon the requirement involved. See, e.g., Sec. 219.105, which  must be construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the  unauthorized conduct of an employee that violates Sec. 219.101 or  Sec. 219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such  conduct). Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate offense.  See appendix A to this part for a statement of agency civil penalty  policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> restricts the ability of  the railroads to provide for an appropriate assignment of responsibility  for compliance with this part as among those railroads through a joint  operating agreement or other binding contract. FRA reserves the right to  bring an enforcement action for noncompliance with applicable portions  of this part against the host railroad, the employing railroad, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where an employee of one railroad is required to participate in  breath or body fluid testing under subpart C or D of this part and is  subsequently subject to adverse action alleged to have arisen out of the  required test (or alleged refusal thereof), necessary witnesses and  documents available to the other railroad must be made available to the  employee on a reasonable basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any independent contractor or other entity that performs covered  service for a railroad has the same responsibilities as a railroad under  this part, with respect to its employees who perform covered service.  The entity's responsibility for compliance with this part may be  fulfilled either directly by that entity or by the railroad's treating  the entity's employees who perform covered service as if they were its  own employees for purposes of this part. The responsibility for  compliance must be clearly spelled out in the contract between the  railroad and the other entity or in another document. In the absence of  such a clear delineation of responsibility, FRA will hold the railroad  and the other entity jointly and severally liable for compliance.
