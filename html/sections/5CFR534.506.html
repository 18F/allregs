                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> upon  appointment to an SL or ST position in the agency, subject to the  requirements of this section. In setting a new senior professional's  rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the  individual's experience, accomplishments, and any unique skills,  qualifications, or competencies the individual possesses as they relate  to requirements of the senior professional position and its impact on  the agency's performance. Rates of basic pay above the rate for level  III of the Executive Schedule, but less than or equal to the rate for  level II of the Executive Schedule, generally are reserved for those  newly appointed senior professionals who possess superior leadership,  scientific, professional or other competencies necessary to address key  program and mission requirements, as determined by the agency through  its strategic human capital planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with the agency's written procedures and paragraph  (a) of this section, an authorized agency official may set the rate of  basic pay for an SL or ST employee upon transfer from another agency at  any rate of basic pay within the pay range that applies to the SL or ST  position under Sec. 534.504(a), except as provided in Sec. 534.509(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with the agency's written procedures and paragraph  (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, an authorized agency official may set pay upon reappointment of  a former SL or ST employee at any rate of basic pay within the pay range  that applies to the SL or ST position under Sec. 534.504(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a former agency SL or ST employee is reappointed within 30  days to the same position or a successor position in the same agency,  the agency may not give the individual a higher rate of basic pay upon  reappointment unless the agency head or a designee who provides the  certifications described in Sec. 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of  this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency determines that  a higher rate of basic pay is warranted.</p>
