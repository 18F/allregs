                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Access authorizations must be requested for licensee employees  or other persons (e.g., 10 CFR part 2, subpart I) who need access to  classified information in connection with activities under 10 CFR parts  50, 52, 54, 60, 63, 70, 72, or 76.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request must be submitted to the facility CSA. If the NRC is  the CSA, the procedures in Sec. 25.17 (c) and (d) will be followed. If  the NRC is not the CSA, the request will be submitted to the CSA in  accordance with procedures established by the CSA. The NRC will be  notified of the request by a letter that includes the name, Social  Security number and level of access authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request must include a completed personnel security packet  (see Sec. 25.17(d)) and request form (NRC Form 237) signed by a  licensee, licensee contractor official, or other authorized person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each personnel security packet submitted must include the  following completed forms:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86, Parts 1  and 2) (Part 2 is to be completed by the applicant and placed in a  sealed envelope which is to be forwarded to NRC unopened. No licensee,  licensee contractor official, or other person at a facility is permitted  to review Part 2 information);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two standard fingerprint cards (FD-258);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other related forms where specified in accompanying  instructions (NRC Form 254).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only a Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176) need be completed  by any person possessing an active access authorization, or who is being  processed for an access authorization, by another Federal agency. The  active or pending access authorization must be at an equivalent level to  that required by the NRC and be based on an adequate investigation of  not more than five years old.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To avoid delays in processing requests for access  authorizations, each security packet should be reviewed for completeness  and correctness (including legibility of response on the forms) before  submittal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) bills the NRC for the  cost of each background investigation conducted in support of an  application for access authorization (application). The combined cost of  the OPM investigation and the NRC's application processing overhead (NRC  processing fee) are recovered through an access authorization fee  imposed on applicants for access authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each application for access authorization, renewal, or change in  level must be accompanied by a remittance, payable to the U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, which is equal to the NRC access authorization  fee. This fee must   be determined using the following formula: the OPM investigation billing  rates on the day of NRC receipt of the application + the NRC processing  fee = the NRC access authorization fee. The NRC processing fee is  determined by multiplying the OPM investigation billing rate on the day  of NRC receipt of the application by 55.8 percent (i.e., OPM rate x 55.8  percent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Updated OPM investigation billing rates are published  periodically in a Federal Investigations Notice (FIN) issued by the  OPM's Federal Investigative Services. Copies of the current OPM  investigation billing rates schedule can be obtained by contacting the  NRC's Personnel Security Branch, Division of Facilities Security, Office  of Administration by email to Licensee--  Access--Authorization--Fee.Resource@  nrc.gov</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The NRC's Information Access Authority Program (IAAP) is  considered reimbursable work representing services provided to an  organization for which the NRC is entitled payment. The NRC is  authorized to receive and retain fees from licensees for services  performed. The NRC's Office of the Chief Financial Officer periodically  reviews the fees charged for IAAP and makes recommendations on revising  those charges to reflect costs incurred by the NRC in providing those  services. The reviews are performed using cost analysis techniques to  determine the direct and indirect costs. Based on this review the IAAP  fees are adjusted to reflect the current cost for the program. Copies of  the current NRC access authorization fee may be obtained by contacting  the NRC's Personnel Security Branch, Division of Facilities Security,  Office of Administration by email to: Licensee--Access--  Authorization--Fee.Resource@nrc.gov. Any change in the NRC's access  authorization fee will be applicable to each access authorization  request received on or after the effective date of the OPM's most  recently published investigation billing rates schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certain applications from individuals having current Federal  access authorizations may be processed more expeditiously and at less  cost, because the Commission, at its discretion, may decide to accept  the certification of access authorization and investigative data from  other Federal Government agencies that grant personnel access  authorizations.
