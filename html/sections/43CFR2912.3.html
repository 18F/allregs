Applications for new leases shall be accompanied by consent of the lessee to cancellation of the existing lease upon the issuance of the new lease and by three copies of a statement showing (a) the need for a new lease and (b) any changes in the use or management of the lands or the terms and conditions of the lease which the applicant desires.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 2916_Alaska Fur Farm</p><p class="depth0">Source: 35 FR 9665, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


Sec. 2916.0-3  Authority.</p><p class="depth0">The Act of July 3, 1926 (44 Stat. 821, 48 U.S.C. secs. 360, 361), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease public lands on the mainland of or islands in Alaska, with the exception of the Pribilof Islands, for fur farming, for periods not exceeding ten years.


Sec. 2916.0-6  Policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The authority to lease the public lands in Alaska for fur-farming purposes was granted in order to promote the development of the production of furs in Alaska.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No lease for the purpose of raising beavers will be granted on any area already occupied by a beaver colony nor will any such lease be granted on streams or lakes where the activities of beavers may interfere with the run or spawning of salmon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In order to offer more people an opportunity to lease lands, and to avoid tying up large areas of land unnecessarily, fur-farming leases on public lands will not be granted for areas greater than are justified by the needs and experience of the applicant.


Sec. 2916.0-8  Area subject to lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Acreage limitation and exceptions. (1) On the mainland such leases may be for an area not exceeding 640 acres. A lease may cover an entire island, provided the area thereof does not exceed 30 square miles, and provided the need for such entire island is clearly established. Islands so close together that animals can cross from one to the other and whose combined area does not exceed 30 square miles, will be treated as one island. Islands having an area of more than 30 square miles will be treated as mainland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where a lease is granted for an area in excess of 640 acres on an island, the manager may, after notice to the lessee, reduce the area to an amount not less than 640 acres, if he determines that the lessee cannot reasonably use

all of the area for which the lease was granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lands subject to lease. (1) Vacant, unreserved, and unappropriated public lands are subject to lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except for lands under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, public lands withdrawn or reserved for any purpose are subject to lease, if the department or agency having jurisdiction thereof consents to the issuance of the lease.</p>
