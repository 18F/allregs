P=-111E+72.15
where P=Percent reduction in pressure drop, andE=Average particulate matter emissions (kg/megagram)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A record of average oxygen content in the incinerator exhaust gas for each period of 1-hour duration or more that the oxygen content of the incinerator exhaust gas exceeds the average oxygen content measured during the most recent performance test by more than 3 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of any multiple hearth, fluidized bed, or electric sludge incinerator from which the average particulate matter emission rate measured during the performance test required under Sec. 60.154(d) exceeds 0.38 g/kg of dry sludge input (0.75 lb/ton of dry sludge input) shall include in the report for each calendar day that a decrease in scrubber pressure drop or increase in oxygen content of exhaust gas is reported a record of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scrubber pressure drop averaged over each 1-hour incinerator operating period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oxygen content in the incinerator exhaust averaged over each 1-hour incinerator operating period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Temperatures of every hearth in multiple hearth incinerators; of the
