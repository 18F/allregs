                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)-(17)</em> and the conditions in paragraph (b) of this  section are met. The necessary requirements and conditions must be met  throughout the entire partnership's taxable year for the payments to be  excluded so that either all or none of the payments are excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other conditions. You must have been paid your full share of the  partnership's capital before the close of the partnership's taxable year  in which retirement payments are made. Also, no member of the  partnership can have any financial obligations to you (in his or her  capacity as a partner) except to make the retirement payments. Lastly,  you cannot perform any services for the partnership in the partnership's  taxable year which falls wholly or partially in your taxable year in  which you receive the retirement payments.</p><p class="depth2">Example: D, a partner in the DEF partnership, retired from the  partnership as of December 31, 1976. The taxable year of both D and the  partnership is the calendar year. During the partnership's taxable year  ending December 31, 1977, D rendered no service to any trade or business  carried on by the partnership. On or before December 31, 1977, all  obligations (other than retirement payments under the plan) from the  other partners to D were liquidated, and D's share of the capital of the  partnership was paid to him. Retirement payments received by D under the  partnership's plan in his taxable year ending December 31, 1977, are  excluded in determining net earnings from self-employment (if any) for  that taxable year.</p>
