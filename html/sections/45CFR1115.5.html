                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any individual is entitled to request amendments of records pertaining to him pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request shall be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request should specify the record and systems of records involved, and should specify the exact correction desired and state that the request is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. An edited copy of the record showing the desired correction is desirable. Within 10 working days of the receipt of a properly addressed request (or within 10 working days of the time the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities becomes aware that a particular communication not addressed as prescribed above is a request for correction of a record under the Privacy Act), the General Counsel's office shall acknowledge receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The General Counsel's office upon receipt of such a request shall promptly confer with the office within the Foundation responsible for the record. In the event it is felt that correction is not warranted in whole or in part, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the Deputy Chairman of the Endowment involved. If, after review by the Deputy Chairman of the involved Endowment and discussion with the request or, if deemed helpful, it is determined that correction as requested is not warranted, a letter shall be sent by the Deputy Chairman's office to the requestor denying his request and/or explaining what correction might be made if agreeable to the requestor. This letter shall set forth the reasons for the refusal to honor the request for correction. It shall also inform him of his right to appeal this decision and include a description of the appeals procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An appeal may be taken from an adverse determination under paragraph (c) of this section to the Assistant Chairman/Management, National Endowment for the Arts or the Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities. Such appeal must be made in writing and should clearly indicate that it is an appeal. The basis for the appeal should be included, and it should be mailed to the same address as listed in paragraph (a) of this section. A hearing at the Foundation may be requested. Such hearing will be informal, and shall be before the Assistant Chairman/Management, National Endowment for the Arts, the Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities, or an appointed designee. If no hearing is requested, the request for appeal should include the basis for the appeal. Where no hearing is requested the Assistant Chairman or Chairman before whom the appeal is taken shall render his decision within thirty working days after receipt of the written appeal at the Foundation, unless the Assistant Chairman or Chairman before whom the appeal is taken, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period and the appellant is advised in writing of such extension. If a hearing is requested, the Foundation will attempt to contact the appellant within five working days and arrange a suitable time for the hearing. In such cases the decision of the Assistant Chairman or Chairman shall be made within 30 working days after the hearing unless the time is extended and the appellant is advised in writing of such extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The final decision of the Assistant Chairman or Chairman in an appeal shall be in writing, and, if adverse to the appellant, set forth the reasons for the refusal to amend the record and advise him of his right to appeal the decision under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A). The individual shall also be notified that he has the right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for this disagreement with the refusal of the Foundation to amend his record.</p>
