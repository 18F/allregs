                                Sec. 1.617-1  Exploration expenditures.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> either through  including in income an amount equal to the amount of the adjusted  exploration expenditures (as defined in section 617(f)) or through  disallowance of the deduction for depletion under section 611. Certain  rules are provided in section 617(c) for recapture of exploration  expenditures made with respect to property for which the taxpayer later  receives a bonus or royalty. Under section 617(d), gain from  dispositions of mining property, with respect to which exploration  expenditures have been previously deducted, is to be recognized  notwithstanding certain other provisions of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Expenditures to which section 617 is not applicable. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section  617 is not applicable to expenditures which would be allowed as  deductions for the taxable year without regard to section 617.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 617 is not applicable to expenditures which are  reflected in improvements subject to allowances for depreciation under  sections 167 and 611. However, allowances for depreciation of such  improvements which are used in the exploration of ores or minerals are  considered exploration expenditures under section 617. If such  improvements are used only in part for exploration during the taxable  year, an allocable portion of the allowance for depreciation shall be  treated as an exploration expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 617 is applicable to exploration expenditures paid or  incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of a  fractional share of the working or operating interest to the extent of  the fractional interest so acquired by the taxpayer. The expenditures  attributable to the remaining fractional share shall be considered as  the cost of his acquired interest and shall be recovered through  depletion allowances. For example, taxpayer A owns mineral leases on  unexplored mineral lands and agrees to convey an undivided three-fourths  (\3/4\) interest in such leases to taxpayer B provided B will pay all of  the expenses for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or  quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral which will be incurred  before the beginning of the development stage. B may elect to treat  three-fourths of such amount under section 617. B must treat one-fourth  of such amount as part of the cost of his interest, recoverable through  depletion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 617 is not applicable to costs of exploration which are  reflected in the amount which the taxpayer paid or incurred to acquire  the property. Section 617 applies only to costs paid or incurred by the  taxpayer for exploration undertaken directly or through a contract by  the taxpayer. See, however, sections 381(a) and 381(c)(10) for special  rules with respect to deferred exploration expenditures in certain  corporate acquisitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 617 is not applicable to amounts paid or incurred for  the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality  of any deposit of oil or gas or of any mineral with respect to which a  deduction for percentage depletion is not allowable under section 613.  The purpose of the expenditure shall be determined by reference to the  facts and circumstances at the time the expenditure is paid or incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, and (d) of section 617. See  Secs. 1.617-3 and 1.617-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A taxpayer who makes or has made an election under section  617(a) shall state clearly on his income tax return for each taxable  year for which he deducts exploration expenditures the amount of the  deduction claimed under section 617(a) with respect to each property or  mine. Such property or mine shall be identified by a description  adequate to permit application of the recapture rules of section 617  (b), (c), and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may  not make an election under section 615(e) unless, within the period set  forth in section 615(e), he revokes his election under section 617(a). A  taxpayer who has made and has not revoked an election under section  617(a) may not, in his return for the taxable year for which the  election is made or for any subsequent taxable year, charge to capital  account any exploration expenditures which are deductible by him under  section 617(a); and he must deduct all such expenditures as expenses in  computing adjusted gross income. Any exploration expenditures paid or  incurred after December 31, 1969, which are not deductible by the  taxpayer under section 617(a) solely because of the application of  section 617(h) shall be charged to capital account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time for making elections. The election under section 617(a) may  be made at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for  filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for  the first taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to deduct  exploration expenditures under section 617(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of election to deduct. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer may revoke an  election made by him under section 617(a) by filing with the Internal  Revenue service center with which the taxpayer's income tax return is  required to be filed, within the period set forth in subdivision (ii) of  this subparagraph, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized  representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the  section 617(a) election previously made by him and states with whom and  where the document making the election was filed. A taxpayer revoking a  section 617(a) election shall file amended income tax returns which  reflect any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation  of election for all taxable years affected by the revocation of election  for which he has filed income tax returns before revoking the election.  See section 617(a)(2)(C) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for  provisions relating to extension of the period of limitations for   the assessment of any deficiency attributable to an election or  revocation of an election under section 617(a). In applying the  revocation of election to the years affected, there shall be taken into  account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of  election shall have on other items affected thereby (such as the  deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net  operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is  limited by the taxpayer's income) and the effect that adjustments of any  such items have on items of other taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election under section 617(a) may be revoked before the  expiration of the last day of the third month following the month in  which the final regulations under section 617(a) are published in the  Federal Register. After the expiration of this period, a taxpayer who  has made an election under section 617(a) may not revoke that election  unless he obtains the prior consent of the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue. Consent will not be granted where a principal purpose for the  revocation of the election is to circumvent the recapture provisions of  section 517 (b), (c), or (d). The request for consent shall be made in  writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention T:I:E,  Washington, DC 20224. The request shall include in detail:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An itemization of the taxpayer's deductions under section  617(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A description of all properties and detailed information of the  exploration activities with respect to which the taxpayer has taken  deductions under section 617(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A description of any development or production activities on all  properties with respect to which exploration expenditures were deducted  under section 617(a); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A recomputation of the tax for each prior taxable year affected  by the revocation. A letter setting forth the Commissioner's  determination will be mailed to the taxpayer. If consent is granted, a  copy of the letter granting such consent shall be filed with the  director of the Internal Revenue service center with which the  taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed and shall be  accompanied by an amended return or returns, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has transferred  any mineral property with respect to which he deducted exploration  expenditures under section 617(a), to another person in a transaction as  a result of which the basis of such property in the hands of the  transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis  in the hands of the transferor, the statement submitted pursuant to  subdivision (i) of this paragraph shall state that such property has  been so transferred, shall identify the transferee, the property  transferred, the date of the transfer, and shall indicate the amount of  the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property on  such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deficiency attributable to election or revocation of election.  The statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency for any  taxable year, to the extent such deficiency is attributable to an  election or revocation of an election under section 617(a), shall not  expire before the last day of the 2-year period which begins on the day  after the date on which such election or revocation of election is made;  and such deficiency may be assessed at any time before the expiration of  such 2-year period, notwithstanding any law or rule which would  otherwise prevent such assessment.  [T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12942, June 30, 1972]</p>
