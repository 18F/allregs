                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When OPM specifies that appointments under a particular Schedule  A, B, C, or D authority must be temporary, intermittent, or seasonal, or  when agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal  appointments in Schedule A, B, C, or D, those terms have the following  meaning:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporary appointments, unless otherwise specified in a  particular Schedule A, B, C, or D exception, are made for a specified  period not to exceed 1 year and are subject to the time limits in  paragraph (b) of this section. Time-limited appointments made for more  than 1 year are not considered to be temporary appointments, and are not  subject to these time limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intermittent positions are positions in which work recurs at  sporadic or irregular intervals so that an employee's tour of duty  cannot be scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seasonal positions involve annually recurring periods of  employment lasting less than 12 months each year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temporary appointments, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, are subject to the following limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service limits. Agencies may make temporary appointments for a  period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, C, or  D authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend temporary appointments for  no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment  to a successor position (i.e., a position that replaces and absorbs the  original position) is considered to be an extension of the original  appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties,  in the same major subdivision of the agency, and in the same local  commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original  appointment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary  appointments. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an  agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary  appointment in Schedule A, B, C, or D if that position had previously  been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either the competitive or  excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the  preceding 3-year period. This limitation does not apply to programs  established to provide for systematic exchange between a Federal agency  and non-Federal organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions to the general limits. The service limits and  restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply  when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment  in the same or a successor position under one or more appointing  authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime,  in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on  the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should  employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or  more in any service year, the general limits set out in this section  will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves  continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed  for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to  2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Positions are filled under an authority established for the  purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or enhance their  education, or to meet academic or professional qualification  requirements. These include the authorities set out in paragraphs (r)  and (s) of Sec. 213.3102 and paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Sec.  213.3402, and authorities granted to individual agencies for use in  connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments  beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated by major  reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual  circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing,   restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must  be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or  agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific  position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be  submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.
