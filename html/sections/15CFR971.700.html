                            <p class="depth0">The Act contains several requirements that relate to assuring the safety of life and property at sea. For example, before the Administrator may issue a permit, he must find that the proposed recovery will not pose an inordinate threat to the safety of life and property at sea (section 105(a)(5)). The Coast Guard, in consultation with NOAA, must require in any permit issued under the Act, in conformity with principles of international law, that vessels documented in the United States and used in activities authorized under the permit comply with conditions regarding the design, construction, alteration, repair, equipment, operation, manning and maintenance relating to vessel and crew safety and the safety of life and property at sea (section 112(a)). The Administrator may impose or modify TCRs for a permit if required to promote the safety of life and property at sea (section 105(c)(1)(B)).</p>
