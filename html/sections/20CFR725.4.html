                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Part 718. Part 718 of this subchapter, which contains the  criteria and standards to be applied in determining whether a miner is  or was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, or whether a miner died  due to pneumoconiosis, shall be applicable to the determination of  claims under this part. Claims filed after March 31, 1980, are subject  to part 718 as promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section  402(f)(1) of the Act on February 29, 1980 (see Sec. 725.2(c)). The  criteria contained in subpart C of part 727 of this subchapter are  applicable in determining claims filed prior to April 1, 1980, under  this part, and such criteria shall be applicable at all times with  respect to claims filed under this part and under section 11 of the  Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parts 715, 717, and 720. Pertinent and significant provisions of  Parts 715, 717, and 720 of this subchapter (formerly contained in 20  CFR, parts 500 to end, edition revised as of April 1, 1978), which  established the procedures for the filing, processing, and payment of  claims filed under section 415 of the Act, are included within this part  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Part 726. Part 726 of this subchapter, which sets forth the  obligations imposed upon a coal operator to insure or self-insure its  liability for the payment of benefits to certain eligible claimants, is  applicable to this part as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Part 727. Part 727 of this subchapter, which governs the review,  adjudication and payment of pending and denied claims under section 435  of the Act, is applicable with respect to such claims. The criteria  contained in subpart C of part 727 for determining a claimant's  eligibility for benefits are applicable under this part with respect to  all claims filed before April 1, 1980, and to all claims filed under  this part and under section 11 of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of  1977. Because the part 727 regulations affect an increasingly smaller  number of claims, however, the Department has discontinued publication  of the criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations. The part 727  criteria may be found at 43 FR 36818, Aug. 18, 1978 or 20 CFR, parts 500  to end, edition revised as of April 1, 1999.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Part 410. Part 410 of this title, which sets forth provisions  relating to a claim for black lung benefits under part B of title IV of  the Act, is inapplicable to this part except as is provided in this  part, or in part 718 of this subchapter.</p>
