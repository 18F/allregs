For the purpose of this part,  remuneration does not include subsidiary remuneration, as defined in  Sec. 322.9. Subsidiary remuneration for any day does not prevent such  day from being a day of unemployment or a day of sickness, except as  explained in Sec. 322.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supplemental unemployment or sickness benefits. The term  remuneration does not include money payments received by an employee  pursuant to any nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness  insurance, as defined in part 323 of this chapter.
