Of the following items only  those which apply to the subdivision need be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual system. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If water is to be supplied by an  individual private well, cistern or other individual system, what are  the total estimated costs of the system, including but not limited to,  the costs of installation, storage, any treatment facilities and other  necessary equipment?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If individual cisterns or similar storage tanks are to be used,  state where water to fill them can be secured; the cost of the water,  and its delivery costs for a supply sufficient to serve the monthly  needs of a family of four living in a house on a year-round basis.  Include a statement to the effect that water stored for extended periods  tends to become stale and may acquire an unpleasant taste or odor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If individual wells are to be used and if the sales contract  contains no provisions for refund or exchange in the event a productive  well cannot be installed, include a statement to the effect that there  is no assurance a productive well can be installed and, if it cannot, no  refund of the purchase price of the lot will be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If individual wells or individual cisterns are to be used,  include a brief statement to the effect that the purity and chemical  content of the water cannot be determined until each individual well or  source of water is completed and tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If there have been no hydrological surveys in connection with  the use of individual wells or sources of hauled water for cisterns,  include a warning to the effect that there is no assurance of a  sufficient supply of water for the anticipated population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Is a permit required to install the individual system to be  used? If so, from whom and where is the permit secured? State the cost  of a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Central system. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If water is to be provided by a central  system, who is the supplier? What is the supplier's address?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Will the water mains be extended in front of, or adjacent to,  each lot? When will construction begin? What is the present percentage  of completion of the water mains and central supply plant? When will  service be available to the individual lots? If the central system is  not complete and there are separate units or sections of the subdivision  included in the Statement of Record which have different completion  dates, then the starting date for construction (month and year), the  percentage of construction now complete and the estimated service  availability date (month and year) shall be set forth in the chart in  section XXI of the appendix to this part: Water Chart Form rather than  in a narrative paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> What is the present capacity of the central plant (i.e., how  many connections can be supplied)? If the capacity is not sufficient to  serve all lots in the Statement of Record and is to be expanded in  phases, what is the time-table for each phase to be in service and what  will trigger the beginning of the expansion for each phase? If an entity  other than the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer  will supply the water for the central system; if the operation of that  entity is supervised by a governmental agency and if that entity states  it can supply the anticipated population of the development, then  information as to the capacity of the plant and a hydrological survey is  not necessary. If the entity does not indicate it can supply enough  water for the anticipated population or if the capacity of any central  system is not sufficient to serve all lots in the Statement of Record,  include a warning which describes the limitations and sets forth the  number of lots which can now be served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Have there been any hydrological surveys to determine that a  sufficient source of water is available to serve   the anticipated population of the subdivision?

If there have been no hydrological surveys showing a sufficient  supply of water or no tests for purity and chemical content for the  central system, include a warning to the effect that there is no  assurance of a sufficient supply or that the water is drinkable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Is there any financial assurance of completion of the central  system and any future expansion? If not, include a warning to the effect  that no funds have been set aside in an escrow or trust account nor have  any other financial arrangements been made to assure completion of the  water system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer  operates the central system, have all permits been obtained from the  proper agencies for the construction, use and operation of the central  system? If not, include a warning to the effect that the required  permits, approvals or licenses for construction, operation or use of the  water system have not been obtained, therefore there is no assurance the  system can be constructed or used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If previous completion dates given in prior Statements of Record  have not been met, state that previous completion dates have not been  met and give the previous dates. Underline the answer. If the central  water system is 100 percent completed, no dates are needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Is the purchaser to pay any construction costs, one-time  connection fees, availability fees, special assessments or deposits for  the central system?

If the purchaser is not required to  connect to the central system, must any construction costs, connection  fees, availability fees, special assessments or deposits in connection  with the central system still be paid? If an individual system may not  be installed, so state and indicate water will not be available until  the central system is extended to the lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> If connection to the system is voluntary and not all purchasers  elect to use the system, will the cost to those who do use the system be  increased? If so, include a statement to the effect that connection to  the central system is voluntary and those who use the system may have to  pay a disproportionate share of the cost of the system and its  operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> If the developer is to construct the system and will later turn  it over to a property owners' association for operation and maintenance,  state the estimated date and conditions of the conveyance and if it will  be conveyed free and clear of any encumbrance. If there is a charge or  if the association must assume an encumbrance, state the estimated  amount of either and the terms for retirement of either obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> If the supplier of water is other than a governmental agency or  an entity which is regulated and supervised by a governmental agency,  state that neither the operation of the water system nor the rates are  regulated by a public authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> The warning ``We do not own or operate the central water system  so we cannot assure its continued availability for your use'' shall be  included unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The central water system is owned and operated by the developer,  or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The central water system is owned and operated by a governmental  agency or by an entity which is regulated and supervised by a  governmental agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sewer. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What methods of sewage disposal are to be used (e.g.,  central system, comfort stations or individual on-site systems such as  septic tanks,   holding tanks, etc.) in the subdivision?

State the  cost of a permit and the estimated costs of the system and any necessary  tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If holding tanks are to be used, state whether pumping and  hauling service is available and the estimated monthly costs of that  service for a family of four living in a house on a year-round basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If each and every lot has not been approved for the use of an  individual on-site system, include a warning to the effect that there is  no assurance permits can be obtained for the installation and use of  individual on-site systems. If the sales contract contains no provisions  for refund or exchange in the event a permit cannot be obtained, include  a statement to the effect that there is no assurance an individual on- site system can be installed and, if it cannot, no refund of the  purchase price of the lot will be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If no permit is required for the installation and use of  individual on-site systems, explain whether this may have an effect upon  the purchaser or the availability of construction or permanent  financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the developer has knowledge that permits for the installation  of individual on-site systems have been denied; that there have been  unsatisfactory percolation tests or that systems have not operated  satisfactory in the subdivision, state the number of these rejections,  unsatisfactory tests or operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comfort stations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If comfort stations are to be used, how  many lots will be served by each station?

If the necessary permits have not been  obtained, include a warning that the necessary permits, approvals or  licenses have not been obtained for the construction and use of the  comfort stations; therefore there is no assurance they can be  constructed or used. If there are comfort stations located in different  units and having different completion dates, the chart found in section  XXII of the appendix to this part: Comfort Station Chart shall be used  to show the estimated construction starting date (month and year), the  present percentage of completion and the date on which they will be used  rather than a narrative paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Who is to construct the comfort stations? Is there any financial  assurance of their completion? If not, include a warning to the effect  that no funds have been set aside in an escrow or trust account nor have  any other financial arrangements been made to assure completion of the  comfort stations and there is no assurance the facilities will be  completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Who will be responsible for maintenance of the comfort stations?  Is there any cost to the purchaser for construction, use or maintenance?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Central system. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a central sewage treatment and  collection system is being installed, who is responsible for  construction of the system?

If the  central system is not complete and there are separate units or sections  of the subdivision which have different service availability dates, the  chart found in section XXIII of the appendix to this part: Sewer Chart  shall be used to show the construction starting date (month   and year); the percentage of completion and service availability date  (month and year) in each unit or section rather than a narrative  paragraph. If sewage treatment facilities are to be supplied by an  entity which is regulated by a governmental agency and which is not the  developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer and the entity  has stated it can serve the anticipated population of the development,  then information on capacity need not appear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer  operates the central system, have all necessary permits been obtained  for the construction, operation and use of the central system? Do these  permits limit the number of connections or homes which the system may  serve? If the permits have not been obtained, enter a warning to the  effect that the necessary permits, approvals or licenses have not been  obtained for the central sewage system; therefore there is no assurance  that the system can be completed, operated or used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the system cannot now serve all lots included in the  Statement of Record, either because the supplier of the service has not  stated it can and will serve all lots or if construction has not reached  a stage where all lots can be served or permits to serve all lots have  not been obtained, include a warning which states that all lots cannot  now be served; the number which can be served and the reason for the  lack of capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Will the purchaser pay any construction costs, special  assessments, one time connection fees or availability fees?

Will the purchaser be required to discontinue  use of the individual system and connect to the central system when  service is available? If the purchaser is not required to connect to the  central system, must the purchaser still pay any construction costs,  connection fees, availability fees, or special assessments? If the  purchaser may not install an individual system, so state and indicate  service will not be available until the central system reaches the lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If connection to the system is voluntary and not all purchasers  elect to use the system, will the cost to those who do use the system be  increased? If so, include a statement to the effect that connection to  the central system is voluntary and those who use the system may have to  pay a disproportionate share of the cost of the system and its  operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Is there any financial assurance of completion of the central  system and any future expansion?
