                                Sec. 204.309  Factors requiring denial of a Form I-800A or Form I-800.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form I-800A. A USCIS officer must deny a Form I-800A if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant or any additional adult member of the household  failed to disclose to the home study preparer or to USCIS, or concealed  or misrepresented, any fact(s) about the applicant or any additional  member of the household concerning the arrest, conviction, or history of  substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, and/or family violence, or  any other criminal history as an offender; the fact that an arrest or  conviction or other criminal history has been expunged, sealed,  pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration does not relieve the  applicant or additional adult member of the household of the obligation  to disclose the arrest, conviction or other criminal history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant, or any additional adult member of the household,  failed to cooperate in having available child abuse registries checked  in accordance with 8 CFR 204.311;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant, or any additional adult member of the household,  failed to disclose, as required by 8 CFR 204.311, each and every prior  adoption   home study, whether completed or not, including those that did not  favorably recommend for adoption or custodial care, the person(s) to  whom the prior home study related; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The applicant is barred by 8 CFR 204.307(c) from filing the Form  I-800A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form I-800. A USCIS officer must deny a Form I-800 if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in 8 CFR 204.312(e)(2)(ii) with respect to a  new Form I-800 filed with a new Form I-800A to reflect a change in  marital status, the petitioner completed the adoption of the child, or  acquired legal custody of the child for purposes of emigration and  adoption, before the provisional approval of the Form I-800 under 8 CFR  204.313(g). This restriction will not apply if a competent authority in  the country of the child's habitual residence voids, vacates, annuls, or  terminates the adoption or grant of custody and then, after the  provisional approval of the Form I-800, and after receipt of notice  under article 5(c) of the Convention that the child is, or will be,  authorized to enter and reside permanently in the United States, permits  a new grant of adoption or custody. The prior adoption must be voided,  vacated, annulled or otherwise terminated before the petitioner files a  Form I-800.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> with respect to a  new Form I-800 filed with a new Form I-800A to reflect a change in  marital status, the petitioner, or any additional adult member of the  household had met with, or had any other form of contact with, the  child's parents, legal custodian, or other individual or entity who was  responsible for the child's care when the contact occurred, unless the  contact was permitted under this paragraph. An authorized adoption  service provider's sharing of general information about a possible  adoption placement is not ``contact'' for purposes of this section.  Contact is permitted under this paragraph if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first such contact occurred only after USCIS had approved  the Form I-800A filed by the petitioner, and after the competent  authority of the Convention country had determined that the child is  eligible for intercountry adoption and that the required consents to the  adoption have been given; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The competent authority of the Convention country had permitted  earlier contact, either in the particular instance or through laws or  rules of general application, and the contact occurred only in  compliance with the particular authorization or generally applicable  laws or rules. If the petitioner first adopted the child without  complying with the Convention, the competent authority's decision to  permit the adoption to be vacated, and to allow the petitioner to adopt  the child again after complying with the Convention, will also  constitute approval of any prior contact; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The petitioner was already, before the adoption, the father,  mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin (that  is, the petitioner, or either spouse, in the case of a married  petitioner had at least one grandparent in common with the child's  parent), second cousin (that is, the petitioner, or either spouse, in  the case of a married petitioner, had at least one great-grandparent in  common with the child's parent) nephew, niece, husband, former husband,  wife, former wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter- in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson,  stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, or half sister of  the child's parent(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The USCIS officer finds that the petitioner, or any individual  or entity acting on behalf of the petitioner has engaged in any conduct  related to the adoption or immigration of the child that is prohibited  by 8 CFR 204.304, or that the petitioner has concealed or misrepresented  any material facts concerning payments made in relation to the adoption;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The child is present in the United States, unless the  petitioner, after compliance with the requirements of this subpart,  either adopt(s) the child in the Convention country, or else, after  having obtained custody of the child under the law of the Convention  country for purposes of emigration and adoption, adopt(s) the child in  the United States. This subpart does not require the child's actual  return to the Convention country; whether to permit   the child's adoption without the child's return is a matter to be  determined by the Central Authority of the country of the child's  habitual residence, but approval of a Form I-800 does not relieve an  alien child of his or her ineligibility for adjustment of status under  section 245 of the Act, if the child is present in the United States  without inspection or is otherwise ineligible for adjustment of status.  If the child is in the United States but is not eligible for adjustment  of status, the Form I-800 may be provisionally approved only if the  child will leave the United States after the provisional approval and  apply for a visa abroad before the final approval of the Form I-800.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as specified in 8 CFR 204.312(e)(2)(ii) with respect to a  new Form I-800 filed with a new Form I-800A to reflect a change in  marital status, the petitioner files the Form I-800:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before the approval of a Form I-800A, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the denial of a Form I-800A; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After the expiration of the approval of a Form I-800A;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The petitioner is barred by 8 CFR 204.307(c) from filing the  Form I-800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of intent to deny. Before denying a Form I-800A under  paragraph (a) or a Form I-800 under paragraph (b) of this section, the  USCIS officer will notify the applicant (for a Form I-800A case) or  petitioner (for a Form I-800 case) in writing of the intent to deny the  Form I-800A or Form I-800 and provide 30 days in which to submit  evidence and argument to rebut the claim that this section requires  denial of the Form I-800A or Form I-800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rebuttal of intent to deny. If USCIS notifies the applicant that  USCIS intends to deny a Form I-800A under paragraph (a) of this section,  because the applicant or any additional adult member(s) of the household  failed to disclose to the home study preparer or to USCIS, or concealed  or misrepresented, any fact(s) concerning the arrest, conviction, or  history of substance abuse, sexual abuse or child abuse, and/or family  violence, or other criminal history, or failed to cooperate in search of  child abuse registries, or failed to disclose a prior home study, the  applicant may rebut the intent to deny only by establishing, by clear  and convincing evidence that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant or additional adult member of the household did,  in fact, disclose the information; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it was an additional adult member of the household who failed  to cooperate in the search of child abuse registries, or who failed to  disclose to the home study preparer or to USCIS, or concealed or  misrepresented, any fact(s) concerning the arrest, conviction, or  history of substance abuse, sexual abuse or child abuse, and/or family  violence, or other criminal history, or failed to disclose a prior home  study, that that person is no longer a member of the household and that  that person's conduct is no longer relevant to the suitability of the  applicant as the adoptive parent of a Convention adoptee.</p>
