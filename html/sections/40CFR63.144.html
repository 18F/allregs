                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures to determine applicability. An owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for each wastewater stream to determine which wastewater streams require control for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for different wastewater streams generated at the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine Group 1 or Group 2 status. Determine whether a wastewater stream is a Group 1 or Group 2 wastewater stream in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designate as Group 1. An owner or operator may designate as a Group 1 wastewater stream a single wastewater stream or a mixture of wastewater streams. The owner or operator is not required to determine the concentration or flow rate for each designated Group 1 wastewater stream for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures to establish concentrations, when determining Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average concentration for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for existing sources or paragraph (b)(2) of this section for new sources. The annual average concentration shall be a flow weighted average representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12 month period. For flexible operation units, the owner or operator shall consider the anticipated production over the designated 12 month period and include all wastewater streams generated by the process equipment during this period. The owner/operator is not required to determine the concentration of Table 8 or Table 9 compounds that are not reasonably expected to be in the process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing sources. An owner or operator of an existing source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305

as specified in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific Fm factors may be used only when concentrations of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The total annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New sources. An owner or operator of a new source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine both the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds and the flow weighted annual average concentration for each Table 8 compound. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305 as specified in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in Sec. 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific fraction measured factors are compound specific and shall be used only when concentration of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. The flow weighted annual average concentration of each Table 8 compound means the mass of each Table 8 compound occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Knowledge of the wastewater. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the annual average concentration for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average concentration is not required for Group 1 streams. Examples of acceptable documentation include material balances, records of chemical purchases, process stoichiometry, or previous test results. If test data are used, the owner or operator shall provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical

method, were accounted for in the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data. Where bench-scale or pilot-scale test data are used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document that the data are representative of the actual annual average concentration, or are reliably indicative of another relevant characteristic of the wastewater stream that could be used to predict the annual average concentration. For concentration data, the owner or operator shall also provide documentation describing the testing protocol, and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination of annual average concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test data from sampling at the point of determination or at a location downstream of the point of determination. Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the concentration for the relevant Table 8 or Table 9 compounds, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. For each wastewater stream, measurements shall be made either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A minimum of three samples from each wastewater stream shall be taken. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Methods. The owner or operator shall use any of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (b)(5)(i)(F) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Method 25D. Use procedures specified in Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Method 305. Use procedures specified in Method 305 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Methods 624 and 625. Use procedures specified in Methods 624 and 625 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A and comply with the sampling protocol requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If these methods are used to analyze one or more compounds that are not on the method's published list of approved compounds, the Alternative Test Procedure specified in 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5 shall be followed. For Method 625, make corrections to the compounds for which the analysis is being conducted based on the accuracy as recovery factors in Table 7 of the method.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Method 1624 and Method 1625. Use procedures specified in Method 1624 and Method 1625 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A and comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If these methods are used to analyze one or more compounds that are not on the method's published list of approved compounds, the Alternative Test Procedure specified in 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5 shall be followed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Other EPA method(s). Use procedures specified in the method and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and either paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Method(s) other than EPA method. Use procedures specified in the method and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Method 8260B. Use procedures specified in Method 8260B in the SW-846 Compendium of Methods.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Method 316. Use Method 316 to determine formaldehyde concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sampling plan. The owner or operator who is expressly referred to this paragraph by provisions of this subpart shall prepare a sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant hazardous air pollutants listed in table 8 or table 9 of this subpart. An example of an acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The sampling plan shall be maintained at the facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Validation of methods. The owner or operator shall validate EPA methods other than Methods 25D, 305, 624,

625, 1624, and 1625 using the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The owner or operator shall validate other methods as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Validation of EPA methods and other methods. The method used to measure organic hazardous air pollutants concentrations in the wastewater shall be validated according to section 5.1 or 5.3, and the corresponding calculations in section 6.1 or 6.3, of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section 6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. If correction is required under section 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part, the data are acceptable if the correction factor is within the range 0.7 to 1.30. Other sections of Method 301 of appendix A of this part are not required. The concentrations of the individual organic hazardous air pollutants measured in the water may be corrected to their concentrations had they been measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part, by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Validation for EPA methods. Follow the procedures as specified in ``Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA Waste Methods'' 40 CFR part 63, appendix D.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Calculations of average concentration. The average concentration for each individually speciated Table 8 compound shall be calculated by adding the individual values determined for the specific compound in each sample and dividing by the number of samples. The total average concentration of Table 9 compounds shall be calculated by first summing the concentration of the individual compounds to obtain a total hazardous air pollutants concentration for the sample; add the sample totals and then divide by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run. If the method used does not speciate the compounds, the sample results should be added and this total divided by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Adjustment for concentrations determined downstream of the point of determination. The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average concentration or total annual average concentration when the concentration is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where: two or more wastewater streams have been mixed; one or more wastewater streams have been treated; or, losses to the atmosphere have occurred. The owner or operator shall make the adjustments either to the individual data points or to the final annual average concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures to determine flow rate, when evaluating Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An owner or operator who elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream either at the point of determination for each wastewater stream, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. These procedures may be used in combination for different wastewater streams at the source. The annual average flow rate for the wastewater stream shall be representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12-month period. The owner or operator shall consider the total annual wastewater volume generated by the chemical manufacturing process unit. If the chemical manufacturing process unit is a flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall consider all anticipated production in the process equipment over the designated 12-month period. The procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the flow rate. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Knowledge of the wastewater. The owner or operator may use knowledge of the wastewater stream and/or the process to determine the annual average flow rate. The owner or operator shall use the maximum expected annual average production capacity of

the process unit, knowledge of the process, and/or mass balance information to either: Estimate directly the annual average wastewater flow rate; or estimate the total annual wastewater volume and then divide total volume by 525,600 minutes in a year. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Historical records. The owner or operator may use historical records to determine the annual average flow rate. Derive the highest annual average flow rate of wastewater from historical records representing the most recent 5 years of operation or, if the process unit has been in service for less than 5 years but at least 1 year, from historical records representing the total operating life of the process unit. Where historical records are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measurements of flow rate. Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the flow rate, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Measurements shall be made at the point of determination, or at a location downstream of the point of determination with adjustments for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Where measurement data are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustment for flow rates determined downstream of the point of determination. The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average flow rate of a wastewater stream when it is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where two or more wastewater streams have been mixed or one or more wastewater streams have been treated. The owner or operator shall make corrections for such changes in the annual average flow rate.
