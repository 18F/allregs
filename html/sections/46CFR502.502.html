                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of petition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for an award of fees  and expenses under EAJA shall be by petition under Sec. 502.69 of this  part, shall clearly indicate that the application is made under EAJA,  and shall identify the applicant and the proceeding (including docket  number) for which an award is sought. The application shall show that  the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of an agency or  agencies that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified.  Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall   also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly  the type and purpose of its organization or business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The petition shall also include a statement that the applicant's  net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million  (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an  applicant may omit this statement if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service  that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of  the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a  tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the  Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that  describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under  such section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in  section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The petition shall state the amount of fees and expenses for  which an award is sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The petition may also include any other matters that the  applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and  in what amount an award should be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The petition shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized  officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be  accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of  perjury that the information provided in the application is true and  correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Net worth exhibit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each applicant except a qualified tax- exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its  petition a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and  any affiliates (as defined in Sec. 502.501(d)(6) of this subpart) when  the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient  to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and  its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine  whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The  adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional  information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public  record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public  disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes  there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit  that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a  sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,''  accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public  disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be  withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the  specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of  Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the  information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is  not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be  served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant  seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the  proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information  should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public  record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the  exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's  established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act under  Sec. Sec. 503.31-503.43 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documentation of fees and expenses. The petition shall be  accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including  the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or  similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized  statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual  whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent  in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of  the specific services performed, the rates at which each fee has been  computed, any expenses for which reinbursement is sought, the total  amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or  by any other person or entity   for the services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the  applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any  expenses claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a petition may be filed. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A petition may be filed  whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a  significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in  no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of  the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this subpart, final disposition means the date  on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding  or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement  or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the  Commission and to the courts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as  to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the  award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the  underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying  merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an  application for fees and other expenses in connection with that  adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable  decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying  merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.  [Rule 502.]  [52 FR 28264, July 29, 1987, as amended at 64 FR 7812, Feb. 17, 1999]</p>
