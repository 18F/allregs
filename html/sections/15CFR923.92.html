                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subsections 303(4), 306(d)(3)(B) and 306(d)(10) of the Act foster intergovernmental cooperation in that a state, in accordance with its coastal zone management program, may allocate some of its coastal zone management responsibilities to several agencies, including local governments, areawide agencies, regional agencies and interstate agencies. Such allocations provide for continuing consultation and more effective participation and cooperation among state and local governments, interstate, regional and areawide agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A State may allocate a portion or portions of its grant to other State agencies, local governments, areawide

or regional agencies, interstate entities, or Indian tribes, if the work to result from such allocation(s) will contribute to the effective development or implementation of the State's management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Local governments. Should a State desire to allocate a portion of its grant to a local government, units of general-purpose local government are preferred over special-purpose units of local government. Where a State will be relying on direct State controls as provided for in subsection 306(d)(11)(B) of the Act, pass-throughs to local governments for local planning, regulatory or administrative efforts under a section 306 grant cannot be made, unless they are subject to adequate State overview and are part of the approved management program. Where the approved management program provides for other specified local activities or one-time projects, again subject to adequate State overview, then a portion of administrative grant funds may be allocated to local governments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indian Tribes. Tribal participation in coastal management efforts may be supported and encouraged through a State's program. Individual tribes or groups of tribes may be considered regional agencies and may be allocated a portion of a State's grant for the development of independent tribal coastal management programs or the implementation of specific management projects provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State certifies that such tribal programs or projects are compatible with its approved coastal management policies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On excluded tribal lands, the State demonstrates that the tribal program or project would or could directly affect the State's coastal zone.</p>
