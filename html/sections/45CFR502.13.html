Documents or records determined to be exempt from disclosure hereunder may nonetheless be provided upon request in the event it is determined that the provision of the document would not violate the public interest or the right of any person to whom the information may pertain, and the disclosure is not prohibited by law or Executive Order. The following categories of records are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Records which are specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. This exception may apply to records in the custody of the Commission which have been transmitted to the Commission by another agency which has designated the record as nonpublic under Executive Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information given in confidence.

Such communications include inter-agency memoranda, drafts, staff memoranda transmitted to the Commission, written communications between the Commission and its staff regarding the preparation of Commission decisions, other documents received or generated in the process of issuing a decision or regulation, and reports and other work papers of staff attorneys, accountants, and investigators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency

conducting a lawful security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</p>
