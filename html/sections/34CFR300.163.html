                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A State must not reduce the amount of State financial  support for special education and related services for children with  disabilities, or otherwise made available because of the excess costs of  educating those children, below the amount of that support for the  preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction of funds for failure to maintain support. The  Secretary reduces the allocation of funds under section 611 of the Act  for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State fails  to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by the  same amount by which the State fails to meet the requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances.

If, for any fiscal year, a State fails to meet  the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, including any year for  which the State is granted a waiver under paragraph (c) of this section,  the financial support required of the State in future years under  paragraph (a) of this section shall be the amount that would have   been required in the absence of that failure and not the reduced level  of the State's support.
