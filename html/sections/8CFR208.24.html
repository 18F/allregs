                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination of asylum by USCIS. Except as provided in paragraph  (e) of this section, an asylum officer may terminate a grant of asylum  made under the jurisdiction of USCIS if, following an interview, the  asylum officer determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that  he or she   was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act exist; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As to applications filed before April 1, 1997, the alien no  longer has a well-founded fear of persecution upon return due to a  change of country conditions in the alien's country of nationality or  habitual residence or the alien has committed any act that would have  been grounds for denial of asylum under Sec. 208.13(c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination of withholding of deportation or removal by USCIS.  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an asylum officer  may terminate a grant of withholding of deportation or removal made  under the jurisdiction of USCIS if the asylum officer determines,  following an interview, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alien is no longer entitled to withholding of deportation or  removal because, owing to a fundamental change in circumstances relating  to the original claim, the alien's life or freedom no longer would be  threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a  particular social group, or political opinion in the country from which  deportation or removal was withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that  the alien was not eligible for withholding of removal at the time it was  granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(B)</em>  of the Act had it occurred prior to the grant of withholding of removal;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For applications filed in proceedings commenced before April 1,  1997, the alien has committed any act that would have been grounds for  denial of withholding of deportation under section 243(h)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. Prior to the termination of a grant of asylum or  withholding of deportation or removal, the alien shall be given notice  of intent to terminate, with the reasons therefor, at least 30 days  prior to the interview specified in paragraph (a) of this section before  an asylum officer. The alien shall be provided the opportunity to  present evidence showing that he or she is still eligible for asylum or  withholding of deportation or removal. If the asylum officer determines  that the alien is no longer eligible for asylum or withholding of  deportation or removal, the alien shall be given written notice that  asylum status or withholding of deportation or removal and any  employment authorization issued pursuant thereto, are terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of derivative status. The termination of asylum  status for a person who was the principal applicant shall result in  termination of the asylum status of a spouse or child whose status was  based on the asylum application of the principal. Such termination shall  not preclude the spouse or child of such alien from separately asserting  an asylum or withholding of deportation or removal claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Removal proceedings. When an alien's asylum status or  withholding of removal or deportation is terminated under this section,  the Service shall initiate removal proceedings, as appropriate, if the  alien is not already in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings.  Removal proceedings may take place in conjunction with a termination  hearing scheduled under Sec. 208.24(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Termination of asylum, or withholding of deportation or removal,  by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals. An  immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals may reopen a case  pursuant to 8 CFR 1003.2 and 8 CFR 1003.23 for the purpose of  terminating a grant of asylum, or a withholding of deportation or  removal. In such a reopened proceeding, the Service must establish, by a  preponderance of evidence, one or more of the grounds set forth in  paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. In addition, an immigration judge  may terminate a grant of asylum, or a withholding of deportation or  removal, made under the jurisdiction of USCIS at any time after the  alien has been provided a notice of intent to terminate by USCIS. Any  termination under this paragraph may occur in conjunction with an  exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Termination of asylum for arriving aliens. If the Service  determines that an applicant for admission who had   previously been granted asylum in the United States falls within  conditions set forth in Sec. 208.24 and is inadmissible, the Service  shall issue a notice of intent to terminate asylum and initiate removal  proceedings under section 240 of the Act. The alien shall present his or  her response to the intent to terminate during proceedings before the  immigration judge.  [62 FR 10337, Mar. 6, 1997.
