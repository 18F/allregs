                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a nation identified under Sec. 300.202(a), Sec. 300.203(a), or Sec. 300.204(a) does not receive a positive certification under this subpart (i.e., the nation receives a negative certification or no certification is made), the Secretary of Treasury shall, in accordance with recognized principles of international law:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withhold or revoke the clearance required by section 91 of the appendix to Title 46 for the fishing vessels of such nation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deny entry to the fishing vessels of such nation to any place in the United States and to the navigable waters of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon notification and any recommendations by the Secretary of Commerce to the President that an identified nation has failed to receive a positive certification, the President is authorized to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the importation of certain fish and fish products from such nation (see Sec. 300.206).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any action recommended under paragraph (b) of this section shall be consistent with international obligations, including the WTO Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If certain fish and fish products are prohibited from entering the United States, within six months after the imposition of the prohibition, the Secretary of Commerce shall determine whether the prohibition is insufficient to cause that nation to effectively address the IUU fishing, bycatch, or shark catch described in the biennial report, or that nation has retaliated against the United States as a result of that prohibition. The Secretary of Commerce shall certify to the President each affirmative determination that an import prohibition is insufficient to cause a nation to effectively address such IUU fishing activity, bycatch, or shark catch or that a nation has taken retaliatory action against the United States. This certification is deemed to be a certification under section 1978(a) of Title 22, which provides that the President may direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the bringing or the importation into the United States of any products from the offending country for any duration as the President determines appropriate and to the extent that such

prohibition is sanctioned by the World Trade Organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of certification. Any nation identified in the biennial report to Congress for having vessels engaged in IUU fishing that is negatively certified will remain negatively certified until the Secretary of Commerce determines that the nation has taken appropriate corrective action to address the IUU fishing activities for which it was identified in the biennial report. Any nation identified in the biennial report to Congress for having vessels engaged in PLMR bycatch or catch of sharks that is negatively certified will remain negatively certified until the Secretary of Commerce determines that the nation has taken the necessary actions pursuant to the Moratorium Protection Act to receive a positive certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consultations. NMFS will, working through or in consultation with the Department of State, continue consultations with nations that do not receive a positive certification with respect to the fishing activities described in the biennial report to Congress. The Secretary of Commerce shall take the results of such consultations into consideration when making a subsequent certification determination for each such nation.
