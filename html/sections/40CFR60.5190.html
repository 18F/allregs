                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must establish the site-specific operating limits specified  in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section or established in Sec.  60.5175, as applicable, during your initial performance tests required  in Sec. 60.5185. You must meet the requirements in Sec. 60.5210(d) to  confirm these operating limits or re-establishre-establish new operating  limits using operating data recorded during any performance tests or  performance evaluations required in Sec. 60.5205. You must follow the  data measurement and recording frequencies and data averaging times  specified in Table 4 to this subpart or as established in Sec. 60.5175,  and you must follow the testing, monitoring, and calibration  requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 60.5220 and 60.5225 or established  in Sec. 60.5175. You are not required to establish operating limits for  the operating parameters listed in Table 4 to this subpart for a control  device if you use a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate  compliance with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for  the applicable pollutants, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a scrubber designed to control emissions of hydrogen  chloride or sulfur dioxide, you are not required to establish an  operating limit and monitor scrubber liquid flow rate or scrubber liquid  pH if you use the continuous monitoring system specified in Sec. Sec.  60.4865(b) and 60.4885(b) to demonstrate compliance with the emission  limit for hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a scrubber designed to control emissions of particulate  matter, cadmium, and lead, you are not required to establish an  operating limit and monitor pressure drop across the scrubber or  scrubber liquid flow rate if you use the continuous monitoring system  specified in Sec. Sec. 60.4865(b) and 60.4885(b) to demonstrate  compliance with the emission limit for particulate matter, cadmium, and  lead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For an electrostatic precipitator designed to control emissions  of particulate matter, cadmium, and lead, you are not required to  establish an operating limit and monitor secondary voltage of the  collection plates, secondary amperage of the collection plates, or  effluent water flow rate at the outlet of the electrostatic precipitator  if you use the continuous monitoring system specified in Sec. Sec.  60.4865(b) and 60.4885(b) to demonstrate compliance with the emission  limit for particulate matter, lead, and cadmium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For an activated carbon injection system designed to control  emissions   of mercury, you are not required to establish an operating limit and  monitor sorbent injection rate and carrier gas flow rate (or carrier gas  pressure drop) if you use the continuous monitoring system specified in  Sec. Sec. 60.4865(b) and 60.4885(b) to demonstrate compliance with the  emission limit for mercury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For an activated carbon injection system designed to control  emissions of dioxins/furans, you are not required to establish an  operating limit and monitor sorbent injection rate and carrier gas flow  rate (or carrier gas pressure drop) if you use the continuous monitoring  system specified in Sec. Sec. 60.4865(b) and 60.4885(b) to demonstrate  compliance with the emission limit for dioxins/furans (total mass basis  or toxic equivalency basis).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum pressure drop across each wet scrubber used to meet the  particulate matter, lead, and cadmium emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to  this subpart, equal to the lowest 4-hour average pressure drop across  each such wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test  demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter, lead, and cadmium  emission limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate (measured at the inlet to each  wet scrubber), equal to the lowest 4-hour average liquid flow rate  measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating  compliance with all applicable emission limits. (d) Minimum scrubber  liquid pH for each wet scrubber used to meet the sulfur dioxide or  hydrogen chloride emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, equal  to the lowest 1-hour average scrubber liquid pH measured during the most  recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the sulfur dioxide  and hydrogen chloride emission limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minimum combustion chamber operating temperature (or minimum  afterburner temperature), equal to the lowest 4-hour average combustion  chamber operating temperature (or afterburner temperature) measured  during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with  all applicable emission limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Minimum power input to the electrostatic precipitator collection  plates, equal to the lowest 4-hour average secondary electric power  measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating  compliance with the particulate matter, lead, and cadmium emission  limits. Power input must be calculated as the product of the secondary  voltage and secondary amperage to the electrostatic precipitator  collection plates. Both the secondary voltage and secondary amperage  must be recorded during the performance test. (g) Minimum effluent water  flow rate at the outlet of the electrostatic precipitator, equal to the  lowest 4-hour average effluent water flow rate at the outlet of the  electrostatic precipitator measured during the most recent performance  test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter, lead, and  cadmium emission limits. (h) For activated carbon injection, establish  the site-specific operating limits specified in paragraphs (h)(1)  through (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum mercury sorbent injection rate, equal to the lowest 4- hour average mercury sorbent injection rate measured during the most  recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury  emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimum dioxin/furan sorbent injection rate, equal to the lowest  4-hour average dioxin/furan sorbent injection rate measured during the  most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the dioxin/ furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum carrier gas flow rate or minimum carrier gas pressure  drop, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minimum carrier gas flow rate, equal to the lowest 4-hour  average carrier gas flow rate measured during the most recent  performance test demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission  limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum carrier gas pressure drop, equal to the lowest 4-hour  average carrier gas flow rate measured during the most recent  performance test demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission  limit.</p>
