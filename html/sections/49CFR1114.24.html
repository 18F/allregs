                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Examination. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses  should proceed as permitted at a hearing and should be limited to the  subject matter specified in the order granting discovery. All objections  made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer  taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence  presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objection to  the proceedings, should be noted by the officer upon the deposition.  Evidence objected to should be taken subject to the objections. In lieu  of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written  questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition, and  shall transmit them to the officer, who shall open the sealed envelope,  propound the questions to the witness, and record the answers verbatim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of depositions. At the hearings, any part or all of a  deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be  used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of  the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any one  of the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of  contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking  the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person  designated to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation,  partnership, association or governmental agency (other than this Board,  except in those instances where the Board itself is a party to the  proceeding) which is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any  purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used  by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer or Board finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the witness is dead; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from  the place of hearing or is out of the United States, unless it appears  that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the  deposition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of  age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the party offering the deposition has been unable to  procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances  exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due  regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witness orally  at public hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party,  an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought  in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may  introduce any other parts. Substitution of parties does not affect the  right to use depositions previously taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of taking or using depositions. A party should not be  deemed to make a person his own witness for any purpose by taking his  deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part  thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or impeaching  the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the  deposition, but this should not apply to the use of an adverse party of  a deposition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the hearing any  party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether  introduced by him or by any other party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Motions to protect. At any time during the taking of the  deposition, on motion of any party or of the deponent and upon a showing  that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner  as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party,  the Board may order the officer conducting the examination to cease  forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner  of the taking of the deposition as provided in Sec.  1114.21(c). If the  order made terminates the examination, it should be resumed thereafter  only if so ordered. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the  taking of the deposition should be suspended for the time necessary to  make a motion for an order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordation. The officer before whom the deposition is to be  taken shall observe the provisions of Sec.  1113.6 respecting  appearances and typographical specifications, shall put the witness  under oath, and shall personally, or by someone acting under his  direction and in his presence, record and transcribe the testimony of  the witness as required by these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Signing. When the testimony is fully transcribed or otherwise  recorded, the deposition should be submitted to the witness for  examination and should be read to or by him unless such examination and  reading are waived by the witness and the parties. Any changes in form  or substance which the witness desires to make should be entered upon  the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by  the witness for making them. The witness shall then sign the deposition,  unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is  ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not  signed by the witness within 15 days of its submission to him, the  officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or  of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to  sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the  deposition may then be used fully as though signed, unless, on a motion  to suppress, it is found that the reasons given for refusal to sign  require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Attestation. The officer shall certify on the deposition that  the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true  record of the testimony given by the witness, and that the officer is:  (1) Not a relative, employee, representative or counsel of any of the  parties, (2) not a relative or employee of such representative or  counsel, and (3) not financially interested in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Return. The officer shall securely seal the deposition in an  envelope endorsed with sufficient information to identify the proceeding  and marked ``Deposition of (here insert name of witness)'' and shall  either personally deliver or promptly send the original and one copy of  all exhibits by registered mail to the Office of Proceedings. A  deposition to be offered in evidence must reach the Board not later than  5 days before the date it is to be so offered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notice. The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice  of its filing to all other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Copies. Upon payment of reasonable charges, the officer before  whom the deposition is taken shall furnish a   copy of it to any interested party or to the deponent.
