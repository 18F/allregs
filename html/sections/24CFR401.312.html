Sec. 401.500 through 401.503, and to prevent its use to further a  private interest other than as contemplated by the PRA. As used in this  section, confidential information means information that a PAE or other  restricted person obtains from or on behalf of HUD or a third party in  connection with a PRA but does not include information generally  available to the public unless the information becomes available to the  public as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the PAE or another  restricted person.</p>
