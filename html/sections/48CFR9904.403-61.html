                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Questions have arisen as to the requirements of 9904.403, Cost  Accounting Standard, Allocation of Home Office Expenses to Segments, for  the purpose of allocating State and local income taxes and franchise  taxes based   on income (hereinafter collectively referred to as income taxes) from a  home office of an organization to its segments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By means of an illustrative allocation base in 9904.403-60, the  Standard provides that income taxes are to be allocated by ``any base or  method which results in an allocation that equals or approximates a  segment's proportionate share of the tax imposed by the jurisdiction in  which the segment does business, as measured by the same factors used to  determine taxable income for that jurisdiction.'' This provision  contains two essential criteria for the allocation of income taxes from  a home office to segments. First, the taxes of any particular  jurisdiction are to be allocated only to those segments that do business  in the taxing jurisdiction. Second, where there is more than one segment  in a taxing jurisdiction, the taxes are to be allocated among those  segments on the basis of ``the same factors used to determine the  taxable income for that jurisdiction.'' The questions that have arisen  relate primarily to whether segment book income or loss is a ``factor''  for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Most States tax a fraction of total organization income, rather  than the book income of segments that do business within the State. The  fraction is calculated pursuant to a formula prescribed by State  statute. In these situations the book income or loss of individual  segments is not a factor used to determine taxable income for that  jurisdiction. Accordingly, in States that tax a fraction of total  organization income, rather than the book income of segments within the  State, such book income is irrelevant for tax allocation purposes.  Therefore, segment book income is to be used as a factor in allocating  income tax expense from a home office to segments only where this amount  is expressly used by the taxing jurisdiction in computing the income  tax.</p>
