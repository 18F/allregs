                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classifying defects. Examine each sample unit for the applicable  type of defects listed in the table covering the container being  inspected in Sec. Sec. 42.112 and 42.113. Other defects, not  specifically listed, shall be classified according to their effect on  the intended use of the container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Related defects are defects on a single container that are  related to a single cause. If the initial incident causing one of the  defects had not occurred, none of the other related defects on the  container would be present. As an example of related defects, a can may  be a leaker and the exterior may also be seriously rusted due to the  leakage of the contents. In this case, the container is scored only once  for these two defects since the rust condition can be attributed to the  leak. Score the container according to whichever condition is the most  serious. In this example, score as a ``leaker'' (a critical defect) and  not as ``pitted rust'' (a major defect).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unrelated defects are defects on a single container that result  from separate causes. If the incident that caused one of the defects had  not occurred, the other unrelated defects on the container would still  be present. As an example of unrelated defects, a can may be seriously  rusted, may have a bad dent along the seam, and the label may also be  detached from the can because of improper gluing. In this case it is  unlikely that any of the three defects exist because of a common cause.  Therefore, they are considered unrelated defects and should be scored as  three defects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lot acceptance portion of this procedure is based on the  number of defects per 100 containers. It is necessary to determine if  the defects on any one container are ``related'' defects or  ``unrelated'' defects. A container is scored for the most serious of  related defects, and is also scored for each unrelated defect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recording defects. Record on a worksheet the number, type, and  class (critical, major, or minor) of defects on each sample unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Totaling defects. Add the number of defects in each class, then  add the number of minor, major, and critical defects to obtain the total  defects.
