In order to get a  disability annuity, the claimant must follow treatment prescribed by his  or her physician if this treatment can restore the claimant's ability to  work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the claimant does not follow prescribed treatment. If the  claimant does not follow the prescribed treatment without a good reason,  the Board will find him or her not disabled or, if   the claimant is already receiving a disability annuity, the Board will  stop paying the annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptable reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment.  The following are examples of a good reason for not following treatment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific medical treatment is contrary to the established  teaching and tenets of the claimant's religion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prescribed treatment would be cataract surgery for one eye,  when there is an impairment of the other eye resulting in a severe loss  of vision and is not subject to improvement through surgery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surgery was previously performed with unsuccessful results and  the same surgery is again being recommended for the same impairment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The treatment because of its magnitude (e.g., open heart  surgery), unusual nature (e.g., organ transplant), or other reason is  very risky for the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The treatment involves amputation of an extremity, or a major  part of an extremity.</p>
