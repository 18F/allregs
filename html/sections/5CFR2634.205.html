                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In unusual circumstances, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics may grant a request for a waiver of the public reporting requirements under this subpart for an individual who is reasonably expected to perform, or has performed, the duties of an office or position for fewer than 130 days in a calendar year, but only if the Director determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual is a special Government employee, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a), who performs temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual is able to provide services specially needed by the Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is unlikely that the individual's outside employment or financial interests will create a conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public financial disclosure by the individual is not necessary under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. (1) Requests for waivers must be submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, via the requester's agency, within 10 days after an employee learns that he will hold a position which requires reporting and that he will serve in that position for more than 60 days in any calendar year, or

upon serving in such a position for more than 60 days, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for waivers must be submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, via the requester's agency, within 10 days after an employee learns that he will hold a position which requires reporting and that he will serve in that position for more than 60 days in any calendar year, or

upon serving in such a position for more than 60 days, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request shall consist of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A cover letter which identifies the individual and his position, states the approximate number of days in a calendar year which he expects to serve in that position, and requests a waiver of public reporting requirements under this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An enclosure which states the reasons for the individual's belief that the conditions of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are met in the particular case; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The report otherwise required by this subpart B, as a factual basis for the determination required by this section. The report shall bear the legend at the top of page 1: ``CONFIDENTIAL: WAIVER REQUEST PENDING PURSUANT TO 5 CFR 2634.205.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency in which the individual serves shall advise the Office of Government Ethics as to the justification for a waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event a waiver is granted, the report shall not be subject to the public disclosure requirements of Sec. 2634.603; however, the waiver request cover letter shall be subject to those requirements. In the event that a waiver is not granted, the confidential legend shall be removed from the report, and the report shall be subject to public disclosure; however, the waiver request cover letter shall not then be subject to public disclosure.
