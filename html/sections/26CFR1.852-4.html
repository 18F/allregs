See section  854 and Sec. Sec. 1.854-1 through 1.854-3 for limitations applicable to  dividends received from regulated investment companies for the purpose  of the credit under section 34 (for dividends received on or before  December 31, 1964), the exclusion from gross income under section 116,  and the deduction under section 243. See section 855 (b) and (d) and  paragraphs (c) and (f) of Sec. 1.855-1 for treatment by shareholders of  dividends paid by a regulated investment company after the close of the  taxable year in the case of an election under section 855(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(B)</em>,  shareholders of a regulated investment company who receive capital gain  dividends (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), in respect of  the capital gains of an investment company for a taxable year for which  it is taxable under part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, as a  regulated investment company, shall treat such capital gain dividends as  gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 1  year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for  taxable years beginning in 1977) and realized in the taxable year of the  shareholder in which the dividend was received. In the case of dividends  with respect to any taxable year of a regulated investment company  ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975,  the portion of a shareholder's capital gain dividend to which section  1201(d) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (2) applies is the portion   so designated by the regulated investment company pursuant to paragraph  (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Undistributed capital gains. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A person who is a shareholder  of a regulated investment company at the close of a taxable year of such  company for which it is taxable under part I of subchapter M shall  include in his gross income as a gain from the sale or exchange of a  capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years  beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) any  amount of undistributed capital gains. The term ``undistributed capital  gains'' means the amount designated as undistributed capital gains in  accordance with paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.852-9, but the amount so  designated shall not exceed the shareholder's proportionate part of the  amount subject to tax under section 852(b)(3)(A). Such amount shall be  included in gross income for the taxable year of the shareholder in  which falls the last day of the taxable year of the regulated investment  company in respect of which the undistributed capital gains were  designated. The amount of such gains designated under paragraph (a) of  Sec. 1.852-9 as gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2) shall be  included in the shareholder's gross income as gain described in section  1201(d) (1) or (2).

Thus, if a cash dividend paid to shareholders of  record as of the close of the regulated investment company's taxable  year would be considered income to the purchaser, then the purchaser is  also considered to be the shareholder of such company at the close of  its taxable year for purposes of including an amount of undistributed  capital gains in gross income. If, in such a case, notice on Form 2439  is, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.852-9, mailed by the  regulated investment company to the seller, then the seller   shall be considered the nominee of the purchaser and, as such, shall be  subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.852-9. For rules  for determining whether a dividend is income to the purchaser or seller  of a share of stock, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.61-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of Sec. 1.705-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nonresident alien individuals. If the shareholder required to  include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under  section 852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a  nonresident alien individual, such shareholder shall be treated, for  purposes of section 871 and the regulations thereunder, as having  realized a long-term capital gain in such amount on the last day of the  taxable year of the regulated investment company in respect of which the  undistributed capital gains were designated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect on earnings and profits of corporate shareholders of a  regulated investment company. If a shareholder required to include an  amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section  852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a corporation,  such corporation, in computing its earnings and profits for the taxable  year for which such amount is so includible, shall treat such amount as  if it had actually been received and the taxes paid shall include any  amount of tax liability satisfied by a credit under section 852(b)(3)(D)  and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of capital gain dividend--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A capital  gain dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C), is any dividend or  part thereof which is designated by a regulated investment company as a  capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders  within the period specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If the  aggregate amount so designated with respect to the taxable year  (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable  year pursuant to an election under section 855) is greater than the  excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital  loss of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall  be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount  so designated which such excess of the net long-term capital gain over  the net short-term capital loss bears to the aggregate amount so  designated. For example, a regulated investment company making its  return on the calendar year basis advised its shareholders by written  notice mailed December 30, 1955, that of a distribution of $500,000 made  December 15, 1955, $200,000 constituted a capital gain dividend,  amounting to $2 per share. It was later discovered that an error had  been made in determining the excess of the net long-term capital gain  over the net short-term capital loss of the taxable year, and that such  excess was $100,000 instead of $200,000. In such case each   shareholder would have received a capital gain dividend of $1 per share  instead of $2 per share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (d) gain for certain taxable years. In the case of  capital gain dividends with respect to any taxable year of a regulated  investment company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before  January 1, 1975 (including capital gain dividends paid after the close  of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 855), the  company must include in its written notice under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section a statement showing the shareholder's proportionate share  of the capital gain dividend which is gain described in section  1201(d)(1) and his proportionate share of such dividend which is gain  described in section 1201(d)(2). In determining the portion of the  capital gain dividend which, in the hands of a shareholder, is gain  described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), the regulated investment  company shall consider that capital gain dividends for a taxable year  are first made from its long-term capital gains for such year which are  not described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), to the extent thereof, and  then from its long-term capital gains for such year which are described  in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). A shareholder's proportionate share of  gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) is the amount which  bears the same ratio to the amount paid to him as a capital gain  dividend in respect of such year as (i) the aggregate amount of the  company's gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) and paid to  all shareholders bears to (ii) the aggregate amount of the capital gain  dividend   paid to all shareholders in respect of such year. A shareholder's  proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(2)  shall be determined in a similar manner. Every regulated investment  company shall keep a record of the proportion of each capital gain  dividend (to which this paragraph applies) which is gain described in  section 1201(d) (1) or (2). If, for his taxable year, a shareholder must  include in his gross income a capital gain dividend to which this  paragraph applies, he shall attach to his income tax return for such  taxable year a statement showing, with respect to the total of such  dividends for such taxable year received from each regulated investment  company, the name and address of the regulated investment company from  which such dividends are received, the amount of such dividends, the  portion of such dividends which was designated as gain described in  section 1201(d)(1), and the portion of such dividends which was  designated as gain described in section 1201(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mailing of written notice to shareholders. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as  provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the written notice  designating a dividend or part thereof as a capital gain dividend must  be mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30 days for a  taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the  taxable year of the regulated investment company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a determination (as defined in section 860(e)) after  November 6, 1978, increases the excess for the taxable year of the net  capital gain over the deduction for capital gains dividends paid, then a  regulated investment company may designate all or part of any dividend  as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its  shareholders at any time during the 120-day period immediately following  the date of the determination. The aggregate amount designated during  this period may not exceed this increase. A dividend may be designated  if it is actually paid during the taxable year, is one paid after the  close of the taxable year to which section 855 applies, or is a  deficiency dividend (as defined in section 860(f)), including a  deficiency dividend paid by an acquiring corporation to which section  381(c)(25) applies. The date of a determination is established under  Sec. 1.860-2(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special treatment of loss on the sale or exchange of regulated  investment company stock held less than 31 days--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under  section 852(b)(4), if any person, with respect to a share of regulated  investment company stock acquired by such person after December 31,  1957, and held for a period of less than 31 days, is required by section  852(b)(3) (B) or (D) to include in gross income as a gain from the sale  or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of a capital gain dividend, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amount of undistributed capital gains,  then such person shall, to the extent of such amount, treat any loss on  the sale or exchange of such share of stock as a loss from the sale or  exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for  taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years  beginning in 1977). Such special treatment with respect to the sale of  regulated investment company stock held for a period of less than 31  days is applicable to losses for taxable years ending after December 31,  1957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of holding period. The rules contained in section  246(c)(3) (relating to the determination of holding periods for purposes  of the deduction for dividends received) shall be applied in determining  whether, for purposes of section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph, a share  of regulated investment company stock has been held for a period of less  than 31 days. In applying those rules, however, ``30 days'' shall be  substituted for the number of days specified in subparagraph (B) of  section 246(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The application of section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On December 15, 1958, A purchased a share of stock in the X  regulated investment company for $20. The X regulated investment company  declared a capital gain dividend of $2 per share to shareholders of  record on December 31, 1958. A, therefore, received a capital gain  dividend of $2 which, pursuant to section 852(b)(3)(B), he must treat as  a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6  months.   On January 5, 1959, A sold his share of stock in the X regulated  investment company for $17.50, which sale resulted in a loss of $2.50.  Under section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph, A must treat $2 of such loss  (an amount equal to the capital gain dividend received with respect to  such share of stock) as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital  asset held for more than 6 months.
