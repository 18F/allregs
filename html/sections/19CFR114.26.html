                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unconditional discharge. An A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet shall be discharged unconditionally by the port director when he is satisfied that all merchandise covered thereby is reexported or destroyed. A TIR carnet shall be discharged unconditionally when all merchandise covered thereby has been properly entered, placed in general order, or exported under customs supervision. In all other cases, any discrepancy shall be noted on the appropriate counterfoil, and action shall be taken in accordance with Sec. 10.39 or Sec. 18.6 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of discharge. When a port director has discharged a carnet unconditionally by completion of the appropriate counterfoil, no claim may be brought against the guaranteeing association for payment under the carnet unless it can be established that the discharge was obtained improperly or fraudulently or, in the case of an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet, that there has been a breach of the conditions of temporary importation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonacceptance or cancellation of TIR carnets. If a TIR carnet presented to Customs is not accepted, it shall be stamped ``Not Taken on Charge'' (see Sec. 114.22(c)(2)). If merchandise not required to be transported in bond moving under cover of a TIR carnet is not exported, the carnet shall be stamped ``Cancelled.''
