                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if the fee  specified in the notice of allowance is not paid within 1 month from the  date of the notice, the application shall be considered abandoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request by the Office, the owner shall replenish the viable  basic seed sample of the variety and shall pay the handling fee for  replenishment. Upon request, the sample of seed which has been replaced  shall be returned to the owner, otherwise it shall be destroyed. Failure  to replenish viable basic seed within 3 months from the date of request  shall result in the certificate being regarded as abandoned. No sooner  than 1 year after the date of such request, notices of abandoned  certificates shall be published in the Official Journal, indicating that  the variety has become open for use by the public and, if previously  specified to be sold by variety name as ``certified seed only,'' that  such restriction no longer applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the allowance fee, the viable basic seed sample or the fee  for delayed payment are submitted within 9 months of the final due date,  it may be accepted by the Commissioner as though no abandonment had  occurred. For good cause, the Commissioner may extend for a reasonable  time the period for submitting a viable basic seed sample before  declaring the certificate abandoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certificate may be voluntarily abandoned by the applicant or  his or   her attorney or agent of record or the assignee of record by notifying  the Commissioner in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the  Commissioner shall publish a notice in the Official Journal that the  variety has become open for use by the public, and if previously  specified to be sold by variety name as ``certified seed only,'' that  such restriction no longer applies.
