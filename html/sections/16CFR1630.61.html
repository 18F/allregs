The notice of approval was corrected on  March 17, 1972 (37 FR 5676). This approval is continued in effect by the  Consumer Product Safety Commission pursuant to section 30(e) of the  Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2079(e)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any hide carpet or rug for which such alternative procedure is  utilized must be labeled with a conspicuous, legible and permanent label  containing the following statement:</p><p class="depth2">DO NOT WASH OR DRY CLEAN</p><p class="depth2">This rug has been treated with a flame retardant. To keep rug  attractive and clean use the following methods:</p><p class="depth2">To eliminate loose dirt or dust, vacuum or shake pelt outdoors.</p><p class="depth2">For spot cleaning, use water dampened cloth and rub lightly in one  direction.</p><p class="depth2">DO NOT USE DETERGENTS OR OTHER STAIN REMOVERS</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The alternative procedure is as follows: The test specimens  shall be cut to size 9 x 9 before the procedure is  initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shake specimen vigorously to remove any loose fibers, dust and  possible accumulated debris.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Place specimen on a solid flat surface and anchor or hold firmly  while conducting the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Select an operating applicator consisting of a rod at least  2 in diameter and 9 long composed of nonabsorbant  material such as glass or plastic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Select sufficient cloth to form at least five layers when  wrapped around the operating applicator. The cloth shall be of the type  known as ``Crockmeter Test Cloth'' as specified in Note 8.3 of AATCC  Test Method 8-1969.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Immerse cloth in water (100 [deg]F.) until thoroughly wetted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Manually wring out the cloth to remove all excess water and wrap  around the operating applicator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Immediately with light pressure, stroke entire surface of  specimen with the wrapped operating applicator in one direction only  along the natural ``lay'' of the hair structure for ten complete  strokes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Place test specimen in a circulating drying oven maintained at  212 [deg]F. until dry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Repeat the above procedure 10 times using a fresh or clean cloth  each time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> After 10 successive cycles of washing and drying the dried  specimens shall be subjected to the testing procedures (pill test) as  outlined in FF 1-70.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This washing procedure and labeling provision are subject to  revision or revocation should it be determined that such procedure is  inadequate to fully protect the public.
