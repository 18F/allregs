of discipline in the military service of which the applicant was a member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that relief is warranted based upon consideration of the applicant's service record and other evidence presented to the NDRB viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in this paragraph and the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, even though the discharge was determined to have been otherwise equitable and proper at the time of issuance. Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Quality of service, as evidenced by factors such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Service history, including date of enlistment, period of enlistment, highest rank achieved, conduct and proficiency ratings (numerical and narrative);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Awards and decorations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Letters of commendation or reprimand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Combat service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Wounds received in action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Records of promotions and demotions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Level of responsibility at which the applicant served;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Other acts of merit that may not have resulted in formal recognition through an award or commendation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Length of service during the service period which is the subject of the discharge review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Prior military service and type of discharge received or outstanding post service conduct to the extent that such matters provide a basis for a more thorough understanding of the performance of the applicant during the period of service which is the subject of the discharge review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Convictions by court-martial;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Records of nonjudicial punishment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Convictions by civil authorities while a member of the service, reflected in the discharge proceedings or otherwise noted in the service records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Records of periods of unauthorized absence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Records relating to a discharge in lieu of court-martial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Capability to serve, as evidenced by factors such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Total capabilities. This includes an evaluation of matters such as age, educational level, and aptitude scores. Consideration may also be given as to whether the individual met normal military standards of acceptability for military service and similar indicators of an individual's ability to serve satisfactorily, as well as ability to adjust to military service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Family and personal problems. This includes matters in extenuation or mitigation of the reason for discharge that may have affected the applicant's ability to serve satisfactorily.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Arbitrary or capricious actions. This includes actions by individuals in authority which constiute a clear abuse of such authority and that, although not amounting to prejudicial error, may have contributed to the decision to discharge the individual or unduly influence the characterization of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Discrimination. This includes unauthorized acts as documented by records or other evidence.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
