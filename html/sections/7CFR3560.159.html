                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tenants in violation of lease. Borrowers, in accordance with  lease agreements, may terminate or refuse to renew a tenant's lease only  for material non-compliance with the lease provisions, material non- compliance with the occupancy rules, or other good causes. Prior to  terminating a lease, the borrower must give the tenant written notice of  the violation and give the tenant an opportunity to correct the  violation. Subsequently, termination may only occur when the incidences  related to the termination are documented and there is documentation  that the tenant was given notice prior to the initiation of the  termination action that their activities would result in occupancy  termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material non-compliance with lease provisions or occupancy  rules, for purposes of occupancy termination by a borrower, includes  actions such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Violations of lease provisions or occupancy rules that are  substantial and/or repeated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-payment or repeated late payment of rent or other financial  obligations due under the lease or occupancy rules; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Admission to or conviction for use, attempted use, possession,  manufacture, selling, or distribution of an illegal controlled substance  when such activity occurred on the housing project's premises by the  tenant, a member of the tenant's household, a guest of the tenant, or  any other person under the tenant's control at the time of the activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Good causes, for purposes of occupancy terminations by a  borrower, include actions such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Actions by the tenant or a member of the tenant's household  which disrupt the livability of the housing by threatening the health  and safety of other persons or the right of other persons to enjoyment  of the premises and related facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Actions by the tenant or a member of the tenant's household  which result in substantial physical damage causing an adverse financial  effect on the housing or the property of other persons; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Actions prohibited by state and local laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lease expiration or tenant eligibility. A tenant's occupancy in  an Agency-financed housing project may not be terminated by a borrower  when the lease agreement expires unless the tenant's actions meet the  conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section, or the tenant is  no longer eligible for occupancy in the housing. Borrowers must handle  terminations of occupancy due to a change in tenant eligibility status  in accordance with Sec. 3560.158. At a minimum, the occupancy  termination notice must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A specific date by which lease termination will occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the basis for lease termination with specific  reference to the provisions of the lease or occupancy rules that, in the  borrower's judgment, have been violated by the tenant in a manner  constituting material non-compliance or good cause; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement explaining the conditions under which the borrower  may initiate judicial action to enforce the lease termination notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other terminations. If occupancy is terminated due to conditions  which are beyond the control of the tenant, such as a condition related  to required repair or rehabilitation of the building, or a natural  disaster, the tenants who are affected by such a circumstance are  entitled to benefits under the Uniform Relocation Act and may request a  Letter of Priority Entitlement (LOPE) from the Agency. If tenants need  additional time to secure replacement   housing, the Agency may, at the tenant's request, extend the LOPE  entitlement period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criminal activity. Borrowers may terminate tenancy for criminal  activity or alcohol abuse by household members in accordance with the  provisions of 24 CFR 5.858, 5.859, 5.860, and 5.861.</p>
