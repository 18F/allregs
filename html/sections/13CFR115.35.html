The Surety must take all necessary steps to mitigate Losses resulting from any of the events in paragraph (a) of this section, including the disposal at fair market value of any collateral held by or available to the Surety. Unless SBA notifies the Surety otherwise, the Surety must take charge of all claims or suits arising from a defaulted bond, and compromise, settle and defend such suits. The Surety must handle and process all claims under the bond and all settlements and recoveries as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim reimbursement requests.

Claims submitted after 90 days must be accompanied by substantiation satisfactory to SBA.

The Surety must notify SBA immediately of any substantial changes in the status of the claim or the amounts of Loss reserves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reservation of SBA rights. The payment by SBA of a Surety's claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the Prior Approval Agreement, the regulations set forth in this part 115, or any defense SBA may have against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of notification that a claim or any portion of a claim should not have been paid by SBA, the Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.
