                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility criteria. A prisoner is considered eligible for the  short-term full diet program under the following general criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prisoner is to be or has been held in excess of one day in a  holding jail or other facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incarcerating officials do not provide the prisoner food, and  food is not available from any other sources, including private funding  from family or friends; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the funds exceed an amount to be established by the  Department, the prisoner signs a promissory note for funds expended,  since the assistance is on a normally reimbursable basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consular responsibility. As soon as the consular officer is  aware that a U.S. national is incarcerated in a facility wherein food is  not routinely provided, the consular officer should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contact the prisoner in accordance with existing procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the normal cost of basic diet and best method of  effecting payment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Attempt to secure funds from private sources such as family or  friends;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Because funds expended by the Department to cover the short-term  full diet program normally are on a reimbursable basis, have the  prisoner execute a promissory note; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contact the Department, providing the above information, for  approval and authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emergency expenditure authorization. Since an immediate need for  a short-term full diet program often prohibits the delay inherent in  contacting the Department and receiving authority to expend funds, the  consular officer can expend up to an amount to be established by the  Department without prior Departmental approval if the prisoner's case  meets the criteria established in paragraph (a) of this section.  Expenditures above the predetermined limit must receive the prior  approval of the Department.</p>
