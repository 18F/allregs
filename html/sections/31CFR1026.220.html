                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (a)(5) of this section. The  CIP must be a part of each futures commission merchant's and introducing  broker's anti-money laundering compliance program required under 31  U.S.C. 5318(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Customer information required. The CIP must include  procedures for opening an account that specify identifying information  that will be obtained from each customer. Except as permitted by  paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, each futures commission merchant  and introducing broker must obtain, at a minimum, the following  information prior to opening an account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Date of birth, for an individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Address, which shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For an individual, a residential or business street address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an individual who does not have a residential or business  street address, an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box  number, or the residential or business street address of a next of kin  or another contact individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation,  partnership or trust), a principal place of business, local office or  other physical location; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identification number, which shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a U.S. person, a taxpayer identification number; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following: A taxpayer  identification number, a passport number and country of issuance, an  alien identification card number, or the number and country of issuance  of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or  residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">When opening an account for a foreign business or enterprise that  does not have an identification number, the futures commission merchant  or introducing broker must request alternative government-issued  documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification  number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a  customer prior to opening an account, the CIP may include procedures for  opening an account for a customer that has applied for, but has not  received, a taxpayer identification number. In this case, the CIP must  include procedures to confirm that the application was filed before the  customer opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification  number within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Verification through documents. For a futures commission  merchant or introducing broker relying on documents, the CIP must  contain procedures that set forth the documents the futures commission  merchant or introducing broker will use. These documents may include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification  evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar  safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation,  partnership or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity,  such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued  business license, a partnership agreement, or a trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Verification through non-documentary methods. For a futures  commission merchant or introducing broker relying on non-documentary  methods, the CIP must contain procedures that set forth the non- documentary methods the futures commission merchant or introducing  broker will use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> These methods may include contacting a customer; independently  verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information  provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer  reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references  with other financial institutions; or obtaining a financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The futures commission merchant's or introducing broker's non- documentary procedures must address situations where an individual is  unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document  that bears a photograph or similar safeguard; the futures commission  merchant or introducing broker is not familiar with the documents  presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the  customer opens the account without appearing in person at the futures  commission merchant or introducing broker; and where the futures  commission merchant or introducing broker is otherwise presented with  circumstances that increase the risk that the futures commission  merchant or introducing broker will be unable to verify the true  identity of a customer through documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Additional verification for certain customers. The CIP must  address situations where, based on the futures commission merchant's or  introducing broker's risk assessment of a new account opened by a  customer that is not an individual, the futures commission merchant or  introducing broker will obtain   information about individuals with authority or control over such  account in order to verify the customer's identity. This verification  method applies only when the futures commission merchant or introducing  broker cannot verify the customer's true identity after using the  verification methods described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for  responding to circumstances in which the futures commission merchant or  introducing broker cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the  true identity of a customer. These procedures should describe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When an account should not be opened;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while  the futures commission merchant or introducing broker attempts to verify  the customer's identity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When an account should be closed after attempts to verify a  customer's identity have failed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When the futures commission merchant or introducing broker  should file a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable  law and regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and  maintaining a record of all information obtained under procedures  implementing paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All identifying information about a customer obtained under  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any  identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance,  and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy  discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Retention of records. Each futures commission merchant and  introducing broker must retain the records made under paragraph  (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for five years after the account is closed  and the records made under paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of this  section for five years after the record is made. In all other respects,  the records must be maintained pursuant to the provisions of 17 CFR  1.31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include  procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any list of  known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any  Federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in  consultation with the Federal functional regulators. The procedures must  require the futures commission merchant or introducing broker to make  such a determination within a reasonable period of time after the  account is opened, or earlier if required by another Federal law or  regulation or Federal directive issued in connection with the applicable  list. The procedures also must require the futures commission merchant  or introducing broker to follow all Federal directives issued in  connection with such lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for  providing customers with adequate notice that the futures commission  merchant or introducing broker is requesting information to verify their  identities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the futures commission  merchant or introducing broker generally describes the identification  requirements of this section and provides such notice in a manner  reasonably designed to ensure that a customer is able to view the  notice, or is otherwise given notice, before opening an account. For  example, depending upon the manner in which the account is opened, a  futures commission merchant or introducing broker may post a notice in  the lobby or on its Web site, include the notice on its account  applications or use any other form of written or oral notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sample notice. If appropriate, a futures commission merchant  or introducing broker may use the following   sample language to provide notice to its customers:</p><p class="depth0">Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account</p><p class="depth0">To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money  laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions  to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person  who opens an account.</p><p class="depth0">What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for  your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow  us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or  other identifying documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reliance on another financial institution. The CIP may include  procedures specifying when the futures commission merchant or  introducing broker will rely on the performance by another financial  institution (including an affiliate) of any procedures of its CIP, with  respect to any customer of the futures commission merchant or  introducing broker that is opening an account, or has established an  account or similar business relationship with the other financial  institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other  financial transactions, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The other financial institution is subject to a rule  implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h), and is regulated by a Federal functional  regulator; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The other financial institution enters into a contract  requiring it to certify annually to the futures commission merchant or  introducing broker that it has implemented its anti-money laundering  program, and that it will perform (or its agent will perform) specified  requirements of the futures commission merchant's or introducing  broker's CIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions. The CFTC, with the concurrence of the Secretary, may  by order or regulation exempt any futures commission merchant or  introducing broker that registers with the CFTC or any type of account  from the requirements of this section. In issuing such exemptions, the  CFTC and the Secretary shall consider whether the exemption is  consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act, and in the public  interest, and may consider other necessary and appropriate factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other requirements unaffected. Nothing in this section relieves  a futures commission merchant or introducing broker of its obligation to  comply with any other provision of this chapter, including provisions  concerning information that must be obtained, verified, or maintained in  connection with any account or transaction.</p>
