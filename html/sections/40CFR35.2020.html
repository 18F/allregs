                            <p class="depth0">In developing its priority list the State shall establish the  reserves required or authorized under this section. The amount of each  mandatory reserve shall be based on the allotment to each State from the  annual appropriation under Sec. 35.2010. The State may also establish  other reserves which it determines appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reserve for State management assistance grants. Each State may  request that the Regional Administrator reserve, from the State's annual  allotment, up to 4 percent of the State's allotment based on the amount  authorized to be appropriated, or $400,000, whichever is greater, for  State management assistance grants under subpart A of this part. Grants  may be made from these funds to cover the costs of administering  activities delegated or scheduled to be delegated to a State. Funds  reserved for this purpose that are not obligated by the end of the  allotment period will be added to the amounts last allotted to a State.  These funds shall be immediately available for obligation to projects in  the same manner and to the same extent as the last allotment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reserve for alternative systems for small communities. Each  State with 25 percent or more rural population (as determined by the  population estimates of the Bureau of Census) shall reserve not less  than 4 percent nor more than 7\1/2\ percent of the State's annual  allotment for alternatives to conventional treatment works for small  communities. The Governor of any non-rural State may reserve up to 7\1/ 2\ percent of the State's allotment for the same purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reserve for innovative and alternative technologies. Each State  shall reserve not less than 4 percent nor more than 7\1/2\ percent from  its annual allotment to increase the Federal share of grant awards under  Sec. 35.2032 for projects which use innovative or alternative wastewater  treatment processes and techniques. Of this amount not less than one- half of one percent of the State's allotment shall be set aside to  increase the Federal share for projects using innovative processes and  techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reserve for water quality management. Each State shall reserve  not less than $100,000 nor more than 1 percent from its annual  allotments, to carry out water quality management planning under  Sec. 35.2023, except that in the case of Guam, the Virgin Islands,  American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the  Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, a reasonable amount shall be  reserved for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reserve for Advances of Allowance. Each State shall reserve a  reasonable portion of its annual allotment not to   exceed 10 percent for advances of allowance under Sec. 35.2025. The  Regional Administrator may waive this reserve requirement where a State  can demonstrate that such a reserve is not necessary because no new  facilities planning or design work requiring an advance and resulting in  Step 3 grant awards is expected to begin during the period of  availability of the annual allotment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nonpoint source reserve. Each State shall reserve 1 percent of  its annual allotment or $100,000, whichever is greater, for development  and implementation of a nonpoint source management program under section  319 of the Act. Sums reserved by the State under this paragraph that are  in excess of $100,000 and that are not used for these purposes, may be  used by the State for any other purpose under title II of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Marine estuary reserve. The Administrator shall reserve, before  allotment of funds to the States, 1 percent of the funds appropriated  under section 207 in fiscal years 1987 and 1988, and 1\1/2\ percent of  the funds appropriated under section 207 in fiscal years 1989 and 1990,  to carry out section 205(l) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Indian program reserve. The Administrator shall reserve, before  allotment of funds to the States, one-half of 1 percent of the funds  appropriated under section 207 in fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989 and  1990, for grants for the development of waste treatment management plans  and for the construction of sewage treatment works to serve Indian  tribes.
