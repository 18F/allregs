                            <p class="depth0">The overseas notarial function of notarizing officers of the Department of State is similar to the function of a notary public in the United States. See Sec. 22.5(b) of this chapter concerning the giving of receipts for fees collected and the maintenance of a register serving the same purposes as the record which notaries are usually expected or required to keep of their official acts.
