                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All aliens filing applications for adjustment of status with the  Service under this section must be personally interviewed, except that  the adjudicative interview may be waived for a child under the age of  14, or when it is impractical because of the health or advanced age of  the applicant. Applicants will be interviewed by an immigration officer  as determined by the Director of the Missouri Service Center. An  applicant failing to appear for the scheduled interview may, for good  cause, be afforded another interview. Where an applicant fails to appear  for two scheduled interviews, his or her application shall be denied for  lack of prosecution. Applications for LIFE Legalization adjustment may  be denied without interview if the applicant is determined to be  statutorily ineligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the time of the interview, wherever possible, original  documents must be submitted except the following: official government  records; employment or employment-related records maintained by  employers, unions, or collective bargaining organizations; medical  records; school records maintained by a school or school board; or other  records maintained by a party other than the applicant. Copies of  records maintained by parties other than the applicant which are  submitted in evidence must be certified as true and correct by such  parties and must bear their seal or signature or the signature and title  of persons authorized to act in their behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If at the time of the interview the return of original documents  is desired by the applicant, they must be accompanied by notarized  copies or copies certified true and correct by the alien's  representative. At the discretion of the district director, original  documents, even if accompanied by certified copies, may be temporarily  retained for forensic examination by the Service.</p>
