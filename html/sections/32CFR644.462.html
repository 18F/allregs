                            <p class="depth0">Where the lessor will not accept a cash settlement in lieu of restoration, or desires the work to be done by the Government, the restoration will be performed, without delay, directly or by contract, within the limitations outlined in this subpart. Any contract entered into for such work should provide for required restoration work to be performed on or before the determined effective date of termination of the lease. A complete record of the items of work performed and the costs thereof will be kept. If the lessor, prior to commencement of the work, is not agreeable to executing ENG Form 340, DA Supplemental Agreement Accepting Proposed Restoration, efforts will be made, upon completion of the work, to obtain a release on ENG Forms 232-R, or 231, or on ENG Form 341 in the event of a cash settlement for that part of the restoration not performed. Where the Government is obligated to perform restoration and remove improvements, and it cannot be accomplished by the Government prior to the effective date of termination, a supplemental agreement will be prepared, antedating the effective date of termination, for such periods as may be required to effect restoration and to remove improvements, if the lessor is unwilling to terminate the lease and rental thereunder, with the reservation that the Government will have a right upon the premises for the purpose of performing restoration, conducting sales of improvements thereon, or doing similar acts related to restoration.</p>
