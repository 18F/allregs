                                Sec. 1955.145  Land acquisition to effect sale.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The State Director is authorized to acquire land which is necessary  to effect sale of inventory real property. This action must be  considered only on a case-by-case basis and may not be undertaken  primarily to increase the financial return to the Government through  speculation. The State Director's authority under this section may not  be redelegated. For MFH and other organization-type loans, prior  approval must be obtained from the appropriate Assistant Administrator  prior to land acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Alternate site. Where real property has been determined to be NP  due to location and where it is economically feasible to relocate the  structure thereby making it a program property, the State Director may  authorize the acquisition of a suitable parcel of land to relocate the  structure if economically feasible. The remaining NP parcel of land will  be sold for its market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional land. Where real property has been determined NP for  reasons that may be cured by the acquisition of adjacent land or an  alternate site, in order to cure title defects or encroachments or where  structures have been built on the wrong land and where it is  economically feasible, the State Director may authorize the acquisition   of additional land at a price not in excess of its market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Easements or rights-of-way. The State Director may authorize the  acquisition of easements, rights-of-way or other interests in land to  cure title defects, encroachments or in order to make NP property a  program property, if economically feasible.
