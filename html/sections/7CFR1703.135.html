If such priority is achieved, RUS will process the combination loan and grant application on a first-in, first-out basis, provided that the total amount of applications on-hand for combination loans and grants does not exceed 90 percent of the total loan and grant funding available for the fiscal year. At such time as the total amount of applications eligible for combination loans and grants, if such applications were approved, exceeds 90 percent of amount of combination loan and grant funding available, RUS will process the remaining applications using the evaluation criteria set forth in Sec. 1703.126.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> RUS will not approve a combination loan and grant if RUS determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant's proposal does not indicate financial feasibility, or will not be adequately secured in accordance with the requirements contained in Sec. 1703.134(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant's proposal indicates technical flaws, which, in the opinion of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, or operation of the project; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirements of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT program contained in Sec. 1703.101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS will provide the applicant with a statement of any determinations made with regard to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The applicant will be provided 15 days from the date of RUS' letter to respond, provide clarification, or make any adjustments or corrections to the project. If, in the opinion of the Administrator, the applicant fails to adequately respond to any determinations or other findings made by the Administrator, the project will not be funded, and the applicant will be notified of this determination. If the applicant does not

agree with this finding, an appeal may be filed in accordance with Sec. 1703.137.</p>
