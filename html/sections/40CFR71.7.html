                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Action on application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A permit, permit modification, or  renewal may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been  met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The permitting authority has received a complete application for  a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete  application need not be received before issuance of a general permit  under Sec. 71.6(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit  modification procedures under paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this  section, the permitting authority has complied with the requirements for  public participation under this section or Sec. 71.11, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The permitting authority has complied with the requirements  for notifying and responding to affected States under Sec. 71.8(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all  applicable requirements and the requirements of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, the  Administrator has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices  required under Sec. 71.10(d) and has not objected to issuance of the  permit under Sec. 71.10(g) within the time period specified therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided under the initial transition plan provided  for under Sec. 71.4(i) or under 40 CFR part 72 or title V of the Act  for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, the  permitting authority shall take final action on each permit application  (including a request for permit modification or renewal) within 18  months after receiving a complete application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The permitting authority shall ensure that priority is given to  taking action on applications for construction or modification under  title I, parts C and D of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the  applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the permitting  authority requests additional information or otherwise notifies the  applicant of incompleteness within 60 days of receipt of an application,  the application shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed  through minor permit modification procedures, such as those in  paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, the permitting authority  need not make a completeness determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The permitting authority shall provide a statement that sets  forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions  (including references to the applicable statutory or regulatory  provisions). The permitting authority shall send this statement to any  person who requests it, and to EPA, in the case of a program delegated  pursuant to Sec. 71.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The submittal of a complete application shall not affect the  requirement   that any source have a preconstruction permit under title I of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirement for a permit. Except as provided in the following  sentence, Sec. 71.6(a)(13), and paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and e(2)(v) of  this section, no part 71 source may operate after the time that it is  required to submit a timely and complete application under this part,  except in compliance with a permit issued under this part. If a part 71  source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance  (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a part 71 permit  is not a violation of this part until the permitting authority takes  final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section.  This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness  determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and as  required by Sec. 71.5(c), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline  specified in writing by the permitting authority any additional  information identified as being needed to process the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Permit renewal and expiration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permits being renewed are  subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public  participation, affected State review, and EPA review (in the case of a  program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10) that apply to initial permit  issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate  unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted  consistent with paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 71.5(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, if  the permitting authority fails to act in a timely way on permit renewal,  EPA may invoke its authority under section 505(e) of the Act to  terminate or revoke and reissue the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a timely and complete application for a permit renewal is  submitted, consistent with Sec. 71.5(a)(2), but the permitting  authority has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end  of the term of the previous part 70 or 71 permit, then the permit shall  not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied and any  permit shield that may be granted pursuant to Sec. 71.6(f) may extend  beyond the original permit term until renewal; or all the terms and  conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted  pursuant to Sec. 71.6(f) shall remain in effect until the renewal  permit has been issued or denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Administrative permit amendments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An ``administrative permit  amendment'' is a permit revision that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corrects typographical errors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of  any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor  administrative change at the source;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the  permittee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a  source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in  the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a  specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and  liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to  the permitting authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Incorporates into the part 71 permit the requirements from  preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA-approved program,  provided that such a program meets procedural requirements substantially  equivalent to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 71.7 and 71.8 (and Sec.  71.10 in the case of a delegated program) that would be applicable to  the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and  compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in  Sec. 71.6; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator  has determined to be similar to those in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through  (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain  portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative permit amendment procedures. An administrative  permit amendment may be made by the permitting authority consistent with  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The permitting authority shall take no more than 60 days from  receipt   of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action  on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing  notice to the public or affected States provided that it designates any  such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permitting authority shall submit a copy of the revised  permit to the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant  to Sec. 71.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The source may implement the changes addressed in the request  for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The permitting authority may, upon taking final action granting  a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the  permit shield in Sec. 71.6(f) for administrative permit amendments made  pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section which meet the relevant  requirements of Sec. Sec. 71.6, 71.7, and 71.8 for significant permit  modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Permit modifications. A permit modification is any revision to a  part 71 permit that cannot be accomplished under the provisions for  administrative permit amendments under paragraph (d) of this section. A  permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit  shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minor permit modification procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria. (A) Minor  permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit  modifications that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Do not violate any applicable requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring,  reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an  emission limitation or other standard, or a source-specific  determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility  or increment analysis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition  for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement  and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to  which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and conditions  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid  classification as a modification under any provision of title I; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations  promulgated under section 112(i)(5) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Are not required to be processed as a significant modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i) of this  section, minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit  modifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable  permits, emissions trading, and other similar approaches, to the extent  that such minor permit modification procedures are explicitly provided  for in an applicable implementation plan or in applicable requirements  promulgated by EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. An application requesting the use of minor permit  modification procedures shall meet the requirements of Sec. 71.5(c) and  shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the  change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the  change occurs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The source's suggested draft permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certification by a responsible official, consistent with Sec.  71.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of  minor permit modification procedures and a request that such procedures  be used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify  affected States (and the Administrator in the case of a program  delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10) as required under Sec. Sec. 71.8 and  71.10(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EPA and affected State notification. Within 5 working days of  receipt of a complete permit modification application, the permitting  authority shall meet its obligation under Sec. 71.8(a) to notify  affected States (and its obligation under Sec. 71.10(d) to notify the  Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec.  71.10) of the requested permit modification. In the   case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, the permitting  authority promptly shall send any notice required under Sec. 71.8(b) to  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Timetable for issuance. In the case of a program delegated  pursuant to Sec. 71.10, the permitting authority may not issue a final  permit modification until after EPA's 45-day review period or until EPA  has notified the permitting authority that EPA will not object to  issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first, although the  permitting authority can approve the permit modification prior to that  time. Within 90 days of the permitting authority's receipt of an  application under minor permit modification procedures (or 15 days after  the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under Sec. 71.10(g)  in the case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, whichever is  later), the permitting authority shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Issue the permit modification as proposed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deny the permit modification application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determine that the requested modification does not meet the  minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the  significant modification procedures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Revise the draft permit modification (and, in the case of a  program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, transmit to the Administrator  the new proposed permit modification as required by Sec. 71.10(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Source's ability to make change. The source may make the change  proposed in its minor permit modification application immediately after  it files such application. After the source makes the change allowed by  the preceding sentence, and until the permitting authority takes any of  the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) (A) through (C) of this  section, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements  governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions.  During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing  permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source  fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during  this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to  modify may be enforced against it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Permit shield. The permit shield under Sec. 71.6(f) may not  extend to minor permit modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Group processing of minor permit modifications. Consistent with  this paragraph, the permitting authority may modify the procedure  outlined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to process groups of a  source's applications for certain modifications eligible for minor  permit modification processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria. Group processing of modifications may be used only for  those permit modifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That collectively are below the threshold level of 10 percent of  the emissions allowed by the permit for the emissions unit for which the  change is requested, 20 percent of the applicable definition of major  source in Sec. 71.2, or 5 tpy, whichever is least.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. An application requesting the use of group  processing procedures shall meet the requirements of Sec. 71.5(c) and  shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the  change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the  change occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The source's suggested draft permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certification by a responsible official, consistent with Sec.  71.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of  group processing procedures and a request that such procedures be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A list of the source's other pending applications awaiting group  processing, and a determination of whether the requested modification,  aggregated with these other applications, equals or exceeds the  threshold set under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Certification, consistent with Sec. 71.5(d), that, in the case  of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, the source has notified  EPA of the proposed modification. Such notification need only contain a  brief description of the requested modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify  affected States as required under Sec. 71.8 (and the Administrator as  required under Sec. 71.10(d) in the case of a program delegated  pursuant to Sec. 71.10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EPA and affected State notification. On a quarterly basis or  within 5 business days of receipt of an application demonstrating that  the aggregate of a source's pending applications equals or exceeds the  threshold level set under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section,  whichever is earlier, the permitting authority promptly shall meet its  obligation under Sec. 71.8(a) to notify affected States (and its  obligation under Sec. 71.10(d) to notify EPA in the case of a program  delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10) of the requested permit modification.  The permitting authority shall send any notice required under Sec.  71.8(b) to the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant  to Sec. 71.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> (A) through (D) of this  section within 180 days of receipt of the application (or, in the case  of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, 15 days after the end of  the Administrator's 45-day review period under Sec. 71.10(g), whichever  is later).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> of this section shall apply to modifications eligible for  group processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> of this  section shall also apply to modifications eligible for group processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Significant modification procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria. Significant  modification procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit  modifications that do not qualify as minor permit modifications or as  administrative amendments. Every significant change in existing  monitoring permit terms or conditions and every relaxation of reporting  or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions shall be considered  significant. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee  from making changes consistent with this part that would render existing  permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of  this part, including those for applications, public participation,  review by affected States, and review by EPA (in the case of a program  delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10), as they apply to permit issuance and  permit renewal. The permitting authority shall design and implement this  review process to complete review on the majority of significant permit  modifications within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reopening for cause. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each issued permit shall include  provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be  reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be  reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additional applicable requirements under the Act become  applicable to a major part 71 source with a remaining permit term of 3  or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than 18  months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such  reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later  than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original  permit or any of its terms and conditions have been extended pursuant to  paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Additional requirements (including excess emissions  requirements) become applicable to an affected source under the acid  rain program. Upon approval by the Administrator, excess emissions  offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program  delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10) determines that the permit contains a  material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing  the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program  delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10) determines   that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the  applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same  procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only  those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists, and shall be  made as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reopenings under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not be  initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the part 71  source by the permitting authority at least 30 days in advance of the  date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the permitting  authority may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reopenings for cause by EPA for delegated programs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the  case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, if the  Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke  and reissue a permit pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the  Administrator will notify the permitting authority and the permittee of  such finding in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The permitting authority shall, within 90 days after receipt of  such notification, forward to EPA a proposed determination of  termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate.  The Administrator may extend this 90-day period for an additional 90  days if he or she finds that a new or revised permit application is  necessary or that the permitting authority must require the permittee to  submit additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator will review the proposed determination from  the permitting authority within 90 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The permitting authority shall have 90 days from receipt of an  EPA objection to resolve any objection that EPA makes and to terminate,  modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the  Administrator's objection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the permitting authority fails to submit a proposed  determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or fails to  resolve any objection pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the  Administrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit  after taking the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Providing at least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing  of the reasons for any such action. This notice may be given during the  procedures in paragraphs (g) (1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Providing the permittee an opportunity for comment on the  Administrator's proposed action and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
