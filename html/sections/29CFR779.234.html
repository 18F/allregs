                            <p class="depth0">Section 3(s) provides that any ``establishment which has as its only  regular employees the owner thereof or the parent, spouse, child, or  other member of the immediate family of such owner'' shall not be  considered to be an ``enterprise'' as described in section 3(r) or a  part of any other enterprise. Further the sales of such establishment  are not included for the purpose of determining the annual gross volume  of sales of any enterprise for the purpose of section 3(s). The term  ``other member of the immediate family of such owner'' is considered to  include relationships such as brother, sister, grandchildren,  grandparents, and in-laws but not distant relatives from separate  households. The 1966 amendments extended the exception to include family  operated establishments which only employ persons other than members of  the immediate family infrequently, irregularly, and sporadically.
