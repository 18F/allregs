                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the taxpayer, by prospecting and locating claims or by  exploring or discovering undeveloped claims, has demonstrated the  principal value of oil or gas property, which prior to his efforts had a  relatively minor value, the portion of the tax (or, in the case of  taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 1971, the surtax) imposed by  section 1 attributable to a sale of such property, or of any interest of  the taxpayer therein, shall not exceed 33 percent (or, in the case of  taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 1971, 30 percent) of the selling  price of such property or such interest. Shares of stock in a  corporation owning oil or gas property do not constitute an interest in  such property. To determine the application of section   632 to a particular case, the taxpayer should first compute the tax (or  surtax) imposed by section 1 upon his entire taxable income, including  the taxable income from any sale of such property or interest therein,  without regard to section 632. The proportion of the tax (or surtax) so  computed, indicated by the ratio which the taxpayer's taxable income  from the sale of the property or interest therein, computed as  prescribed in this section, bears to his total taxable income is the  portion of the tax attributable to such sale and, if it exceeds 33  percent (or 30 percent) of the selling price of such property or  interest, such portion of the tax (or surtax) shall be reduced to that  amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the portion of the taxable income attributable to  the sale of such oil or gas property or interest therein, the taxpayer  shall allocate to the gross income derived from such sale, and to the  gross income derived from all other sources, the expenses, losses, and  other deductions properly appertaining thereto and shall apply any  general expenses, losses, and deductions (which cannot properly be  otherwise allocated) ratably to the gross income from all sources. The  gross income derived from the sale of such oil or gas property or  interest therein, less the deductions properly appertaining thereto and  less its proportion of any general deductions, shall be the taxable  income attributable to such sale. The taxpayer shall submit with his  return a statement fully explaining the manner in which such expenses,  losses, and deductions are allocated or apportioned.
