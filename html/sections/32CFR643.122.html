                            <p class="depth0">MACOM may approve local agreements with other Army, DOD, and Reserve elements covering temporary use of existing Army Reserve facilities, Provided, however, That the DA is reimbursed in proportionate share for the services furnished and that the cost of any alterations that may be desired will be borne by the military service concerned. Although no specific form is prescribed for those operational agreements, the agreements constitute interservice support agreements subject to joint AR 1-35/SECNAV INST 4000.20B/AFR 400.27. Nothing in such joint regulation disallows use of DE outgrants to supplement coverages of interservice support agreements when requested and approved in accordance with this regulation. The terms used in the interservice agreements and/or DE outgrants will be those acceptable to the commands concerned. Agreements, however, which provide for the exclusive use of such property by the Air Force or Navy Reserve, or which involve a transfer of funds between services for other than minor utility services, or which involve an increase in personnel strength, or other complications, will be routed to the appropriate DE for execution of a formal permit.</p>
