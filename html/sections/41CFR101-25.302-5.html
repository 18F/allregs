                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Carpeting is authorized for use where it can be justified over  other types of floor covering on the basis of cost, safety, insulation,  acoustical control, the degree of interior decoration required, or the  need to maintain an environment commensurate with the purpose for which  the space is allocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In connection with new construction or alteration of space, if  it is known that the area will eventually require carpeting, then  resilient floor covering should be omitted and the carpeting installed  initially.
