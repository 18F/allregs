If the storage cylinders are  separate from the protected space, the instructions must also include a  schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate  methods of releasing the extinguishing agent should the local manual  release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to a  distribution line must be marked to indicate the space served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An alarm for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be  clearly and conspicuously marked ``WHEN ALARM SOUNDS-VACATE AT ONCE.  CARBON   DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED''. Where a different extinguishing agent is  installed, that agent shall be marked in place of ``carbon dioxide.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each distribution line valve of a fixed gas fire extinguishing  system and the fire main, must be plainly, conspicuously, and  permanently marked indicating the space served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An alarm for an automatic sprinkler system must be conspicuously  marked in clearly legible letters ``SPRINKLER ALARM''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An alarm bell for a smoke detecting system must be conspicuously  marked in clearly legible letters ``SMOKE DETECTION ALARM''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The control cabinets or spaces containing valves, manifolds or  controls for the various fire extinguishing systems must be marked in  conspicuous red letters at least 2 inches high: ``[STEAM/CARBON DIOXIDE/ CLEAN AGENT/FOAM/WATER SPRAY--as appropriate] FIRE APPARATUS.''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each entrance to a space storing carbon dioxide cylinders, a  space protected by carbon dioxide systems, or any space into which  carbon dioxide might migrate must be conspicuously marked as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spaces storing carbon dioxide--``CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN CAUSE  INJURY OR DEATH. VENTILATE THE AREA BEFORE ENTERING. A HIGH  CONCENTRATION CAN OCCUR IN THIS AREA AND CAN CAUSE SUFFOCATION.''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Spaces protected by carbon dioxide--``CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN  CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH.
