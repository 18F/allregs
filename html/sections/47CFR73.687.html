                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Visual transmitter. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The field strength or voltage of the  lower sideband, as radiated or dissipated and measured as described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall not be greater than -20 dB for a  modulating frequency of 1.25 MHz or greater and in addition, for color,  shall not be greater than -42 dB for a modulating frequency of 3.579545  MHz (the color subcarrier frequency). For both monochrome and color, the  field strength or voltage of the upper sideband as radiated or  dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  shall not be greater than -20 dB for a modulating frequency of 4.75 MHz  or greater. For stations operating on Channels 15-69 and employing a  transmitter delivering maximum peak visual power output of 1 kW or less,  the field strength or voltage of the upper and lower sidebands, as  radiated or dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, shall depart from the visual amplitude characteristic  (Figure 5a of Sec.  73.699) by no more than the following amounts:  -2 dB at 0.5 MHz below visual carrier frequency; -2 dB at 0.5 MHz above visual carrier frequency; -2 dB at 1.25 MHz above visual carrier frequency; -3 dB at 2.0 MHz above visual carrier frequency; -6 dB at 3.0 MHz above visual carrier frequency; -12 dB at 3.5 MHz above visual carrier frequency; -8 dB at 3.58 MHz above visual carrier frequency (for color transmission  only).   The field strength or voltage of the upper and lower sidebands, as  radiated or dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, shall not exceed a level of -20 dB for a modulating  frequency of 4.75 MHz or greater. If interference to the reception of  other stations is caused by out-of-channel lower sideband emission, the  technical requirements applicable to stations operating on Channels 2-13  shall be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The attenuation characteristics of a visual transmitter shall be  measured by application of a modulating signal to the transmitter input  terminals in place of the normal composite television video signal. The  signal applied shall be a composite signal composed of a synchronizing  signal to establish peak output voltage plus a variable frequency sine  wave voltage occupying the interval between synchronizing pulses. (The  ``synchronizing signal'' referred to in this section means either a  standard synchronizing wave form or any pulse that will properly set the  peak.) The axis of the sine wave in the composite signal observed in the  output monitor shall be maintained at an amplitude 0.5 of the voltage at  synchronizing peaks. The amplitude of the sine wave input shall be held  at a constant value. This constant value should be such that at no  modulating frequency does the maximum excursion of the sine wave,  observed in the composite output signal monitor, exceed the value 0.75  of peak output voltage. The amplitude of the 200 kHz sideband shall be  measured and designated zero dB as a basis for comparison. The  modulation signal frequency shall then be varied over the desired range  and the   field strength or signal voltage of the corresponding sidebands  measured. As an alternate method of measuring, in those cases in which  the automatic d-c insertion can be replaced by manual control, the above  characteristic may be taken by the use of a video sweep generator and  without the use of pedestal synchronizing pulses. The d-c level shall be  set for midcharacteristic operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A sine wave, introduced at those terminals of the transmitter  which are normally fed the composite color picture signal, shall produce  a radiated signal having an envelope delay, relative to the average  envelope delay between 0.05 and 0.20 MHz, of zero microseconds up to a  frequency of 3.0 MHz; and then linearly decreasing to 4.18 MHz so as to  be equal to -0.17 [micro]secs at 3.58 MHz. The tolerance on the envelope  delay shall be 0.05 [micro]secs at 3.58 MHz. The  tolerance shall increase linearly to 0.1  [micro]sec down to 2.1 MHz, and remain at 0.1  [micro]sec down to 0.2 MHz. (Tolerances for the interval of 0.0 to 0.2  MHz are not specified at the present time.) The tolerance shall also  increase linearly to 0.1 [micro]sec at 4.18 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The radio frequency signal, as radiated, shall have an envelope  as would be produced by a modulating signal in conformity with Sec.   73.682 and Figure 6 or 7 of Sec.  73.699, as modified by vestigial  sideband operation specified in Figure 5 of Sec.  73.699. For stations  operating on Channels 15-69 the radio frequency signal as radiated,  shall have an envelope as would be produced by a modulating signal in  conformity with Sec.  73.682 and Figure 6 or 7 of Sec.  73.699.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>  and (6) shall be controlling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> shall be  controlling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aural transmitter. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-emphasis shall be employed as closely  as practicable in accordance with the impedance-frequency characteristic  of a series inductance-resistance network having a time constant of 75  microseconds. (See upper curve of Figure 12 Sec.  73.699.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a limiting or compression amplifier is employed, precaution  should be maintained in its connection in the circuit due to the use of  pre-emphasis in the transmitting system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aural modulation levels are specified in Sec.  73.1570.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements applicable to both visual and aural transmitters.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic means shall be provided in the visual transmitter to  maintain the carrier frequency within 1 kHz of the  authorized frequency; automatic means shall be provided in the aural  transmitter to maintain the carrier frequency 4.5 MHz above the actual  visual carrier frequency within 1 kHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transmitters shall be equipped with suitable indicating  instruments for the determination of operating power and with other  instruments necessary for proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance  of the equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adequate provision shall be made for varying the output power of  the transmitters to compensate for excessive variations in line voltage  or for other factors affecting the output power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adequate provisions shall be provided in all component parts to  avoid overheating at the rated maximum output powers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The construction, installation, and operation of broadcast  equipment is expected to conform with all applicable local, state, and  federally imposed safety regulations and standards, enforcement of which  is the responsibility of the issuing regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spurious emissions, including radio frequency  harmonics, shall be maintained at as low a level as the state of the art  permits. As measured at the output terminals of the transmitter  (including harmonic filters, if required) all emissions removed in  frequency in excess of 3 MHz above   or below the respective channel edge shall be attenuated no less than 60  dB. below the visual transmitted power. (The 60 dB. value for television  transmitters specified in this rule should be considered as a temporary  requirement which may be increased at a later date, especially when more  higher-powered equipment is utilized. Stations should, therefore, give  consideration to the installation of equipment with greater attenuation  than 60 dB.) In the event of interference caused to any service greater  attenuation will be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a limiting or compression amplifier is used in conjunction  with the aural transmitter, due operating precautions should be  maintained because of pre-emphasis in the transmitting system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TV broadcast stations operating on Channel 14 and Channel 69  must take special precautions to avoid interference to adjacent spectrum  land mobile radio service facilities. Where a TV station is authorized  and operating prior to the authorization and operation of the land  mobile facility, a Channel 14 station must attenuate its emissions  within the frequency range 467 to 470 MHz and a Channel 69 station must  attentuate its emissions within the frequency range 806 to 809 MHz if  necessary to permit reasonable use of the adjacent frequencies by land  mobile licensees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements listed below apply to permittees authorized to  construct a new station on TV Channel 14 or TV Channel 69, and to  licensees authorized to change the channel of an existing station to  Channel 14 or to Channel 69, to increase effective radiated power (ERP)  (including any change in directional antenna characteristics that  results in an increase in ERP in any direction), or to change the  transmitting location of an existing station.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph, a protected land mobile  facility is a receiver that is intended to receive transmissions from  licensed land mobile stations within the frequency band below 470 MHz  (as relates to Channel 14) or above 806 MHz (as relates to Channel 69),  and is associated with one or more land mobile stations for which a  license has been issued by the Commission, or a proper application has  been received by the Commission prior to the date of the filing of the  TV construction permit application. However, a land mobile facility will  not be protected if it is proposed in an application that is denied or  dismissed and that action is no longer subject to Commission review.  Further, if the land mobile station is not operating when the TV  facility commences operation and it does not commence operation within  the time permitted by its authorization in accordance with part 90 of  this chapter, it will not be protected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A TV permittee must take steps before construction to identify  potential interference to normal land mobile operation that could be  caused by TV emissions outside the authorized channel, land mobile  receiver desensitization or intermodulation. It must install filters and  take other precautions as necessary, and submit evidence that no  interference is being caused before it will be permitted to transmit  programming on the new facilities pursuant to the provisions of Sec.   73.1615 or Sec.  73.1620 of this part. A TV permittee must reduce its  emissions within the land mobile channel of a protected land mobile  facility that is receiving interference caused by the TV emission  producing a vertically polarized signal and a field strength in excess  of 17 dBu at the land mobile receiver site on the land mobile frequency.  The TV emission should be measured with equipment set to a 30 kHz  measurement bandwidth including the entire applicable land mobile  channel. A TV permittee must correct a desensitization problem if its  occurrence can be directly linked to the start of the TV operation and  the land mobile station is using facilities with typical desensitization  rejection characteristics. A TV permittee must identify the source of an  intermodulation product that is generated when the TV operation  commences. If the intermodulation source is under its control, the TV  permittee must correct the problem. If the intermodulation source is  beyond the TV permittee's control, it must cooperate in the resolution  of the problem and   should provide whatever technical assistance it can.
