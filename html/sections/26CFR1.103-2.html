                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issued before March 28, 1942. (1) Section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916 (12 U.S.C. 931), provides that Federal land banks and Federal land bank associations, including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from taxation, except taxes upon real estate. Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913 (12 U.S.C. 531), provides that Federal reserve banks, including the capital stock and surplus therein and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from taxation, except taxes upon real estate. Section 13 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1433) provides that the Federal Home Loan Bank including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, its advances, and its income shall be exempt from all taxation, except taxes upon real estate. Section 5(h) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 1464(h)) provides that shares of Federal savings and loan associations shall, both as to their value and the income therefrom, be exempt from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) imposed by the United States. Under the above-mentioned provisions, income consisting of dividends on stock of Federal land banks, Federal land bank associations, Federal home loan banks, and Federal reserve banks is not, in the case of stock issued before March 28, 1942, includable in gross income. Income consisting of dividends on share accounts of Federal savings and loan associations is includable in gross income but, in the case of shares issued before March 28, 1942, is not subject to the normal tax on income. For taxability of such income in the case of such stock or shares issued on or after March 28, 1942, see section 6 of the Public Debt Act of 1942 (31 U.S.C. 742a) and paragraph (b) of this section. For the time at which a stock or share is issued within the meaning of this section, see paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916 (12 U.S.C. 931), provides that Federal land banks and Federal land bank associations, including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from taxation, except taxes upon real estate.

For the time at which a stock or share is issued within the meaning of this section, see paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regardless of the exemption from income tax of dividends paid on the stock of Federal reserve banks, dividends paid by member banks are treated like dividends of ordinary corporations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dividends on the stock of the central bank for cooperatives, the production credit corporations, production credit associations, and banks for cooperatives, organized under the provisions of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 1138), constitute income to the recipients, subject to both the normal tax and surtax (see section 63 of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 1138c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issued on or after March 28, 1942. (1) By virtue of the provisions of section 6 of the Public Debt Act of 1942 (31 U.S.C. 742a), the tax exemption provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to income consisting of dividends on stock of the Federal land banks, Federal land bank associations, and Federal reserve banks, or on share accounts of Federal savings and loan

associations, are not applicable in the case of dividends on such stock or shares issued on or after March 28, 1942.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By virtue of the provisions of section 6 of the Public Debt Act of 1942 (31 U.S.C. 742a), the tax exemption provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to income consisting of dividends on stock of the Federal land banks, Federal land bank associations, and Federal reserve banks, or on share accounts of Federal savings and loan

associations, are not applicable in the case of dividends on such stock or shares issued on or after March 28, 1942.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of this section, a stock or share is deemed to be issued at the time and to the extent that payment therefor is made to the agency or instrumentality. The date of issuance of the certificate or other evidence of ownership of such stock or share is not determinative if payment is made at an earlier or later date. Where old stock is retired in exchange for new stock of a different character or preference, the new stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time of the exchange rather than when the old stock was paid for. These rules may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A, the owner of an investment share account, consisting of 10 shares, in a Federal savings and loan association, has a single certificate issued before March 28, 1942, evidencing such ownership. In order that A may dispose of half of such shares, the association at his request issues, after March 27, 1942, two 5-share certificates in substitution for the 10-share certificate. The shares evidenced by the two new certificates are deemed to have been issued before March 28, 1942, the shares having been paid for before such date.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The X Bank, a member of a Federal reserve bank, owns 50 shares of Federal reserve bank stock, evidenced by a single stock certificate issued before March 28, 1942. On December 31, 1942, the X Bank reduces the amount of its capital stock, as a result of which it is required to reduce the amount of its Federal reserve bank stock to 40 shares. It surrenders the 50-share certificate to the Federal reserve bank and receives a new 40-share certificate. The 40 shares evidenced by such certificate are deemed to have been issued before March 28, 1942. On December 31, 1943, the X Bank increases the amount of its capital stock, as a result of which it is required to purchase 10 additional shares of the Federal reserve bank stock. The Federal reserve bank issues a 10-share certificate evidencing ownership of the new shares. Of the 50 shares then owned by the X Bank, 40 were issued prior to March 28, 1942, and 10 were issued after March 27, 1942.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A, the owner of a savings share account in the amount of $100 in a Federal savings and loan association, has a passbook containing a certificate issued prior to March 28, 1942, evidencing such ownership. Subsequent to March 27, 1942, A deposits $10,000 in the account. With respect to the $10,000 deposit, the share is deemed to have been issued after March 27, 1942.</p>
