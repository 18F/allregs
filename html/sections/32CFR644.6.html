                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Feasibility investigations and reports. Survey investigations and reports are the studies and reports, specifically authorized by Congress and made by Division and District Engineers as assigned by the Chief of Engineers, to determine the scope, justification, and degree of Federal interest in protection and development of harbors, waterways, shores and beaches, and river basins. For water resource projects the reports include determination of needs of alternative plans of protection and development to be considered for recommendation to Congress for authorization as Federal projects. Survey reports should clearly specify real estate requirements, both immediate and prospective, and the responsibilities of Federal and non-Federal agencies relative thereto. The real estate estimates in the reports should be recent enough to be meaningful for the purpose intended. Documentation regarding the estimates, such as when and by whom made, nature and extent of field investigation, search for comparable sales and similar factual material, shall be maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Phase I and Phase II General Design Memoranda. (1) The General Design Memorandum (GDM) is a report on an authorized project. Its form and content are set forth in ER 1110-2-1150. It includes a real estate section, which consists of a general discussion of real estate requirements for the project, recommendations as to estates to be acquired, a gross appraisal of the necessary land and interests therein, and other features considered desirable to present all major real estate problems and to recommend solutions. Subject to the availability of data, minerals in the project area should be covered in the manner set forth in Sec. 644.5. Detailed sales data are not necessary, but may be included if it is anticipated that recommendations will be made for early acquisition of interior tracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The General Design Memorandum (GDM) is a report on an authorized project.

The requirements for current real estate estimates and necessary documentation thereof contained in Sec. 644.6(a) are also applicable to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Real Estate Design Memoranda. (1) Following approval of the Phase I GDM, a Real Estate Design Memorandum (REDM) will be prepared by the Division or District Engineer. Approval of the REDM shall be in accordance with ER 1110-2-1150, para 21b(2)(j). No land shall be acquired for the project without approval of the initial REDM except (i) in the case of an advance land acquisition situation, (ii) acquisition for local cooperation project, or (iii) when a letter-type REDM has been submitted. The REDM will include the following in the order set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that this REDM is tentative in nature for planning purposes only and that both the final real property acquisition lines and the estimate of value are subject to change even after approval of this REDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Project authorization, designation, location and date of approval of GDM Phase I, including the Recreation Resources Appendix (App A, ER 1110-2-1150).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> General description of the area and estimated total acreage. The total acreage will be broken down as to fee and easement areas. The fee will be further broken down to indicate, separately, the estimated acreage required for the various authorized project purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If any Government-owned land is within the area, indicate the Government's estate, degree of interest required for project purposes, and views of the local representative of the controlling agency as to use for project purposes (see Act of July 26, 1956 (70 Stat. 656) with respect to national forest land).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Appraisal information containing a general statement as to character, present use and highest and best use of the land, local economic conditions which may affect the trend of real estate values in the community and the gross estimate of value for the area to be acquired under the REDM. The gross appraisal on which this estimate is based should be forwarded concurrently to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Information necessary to ascertain responsibility under Pub. L. 91-646 including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number of persons, farms and businesses to be displaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An estimate of all costs, including contingencies to be incurred as a result of compliance with Pub. L. 91-646. Part 641 of this subchapter sets out the items to be considered in estimating these costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information regarding the availability of replacement housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Estimated cost to the United States of lands, easements, and rights-of-way necessary for acquisition by the United States for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Access roads to project area. A statement will be included as to whether existing public roads will be utilized within the purview of 33 U.S.C. 701r-1 or new rights-of-way for access roads will be acquired, with the estimated cost of such new rights-of-way. The proposed plan of access during construction will be fully described.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relocation of highways, roads, railroads, pipelines, and utilities (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73). Statement will be included as to whether the Government or the owner(s) will acquire new rights-of-way, if any, necessary for the various relocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Number of structures and facilities which will come within the purview of section 111 of the Act of Congress approved July 3, 1958 (Pub. L. 85-500), and a preliminary estimate of Government costs (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> A study, in accordance with Sec. 644.5, of present or anticipated mineral activity in the vicinity of the project which may affect the operation thereof. A recommendation including cost estimate, if applicable, regarding the acquisition of the minerals should also be included in this section of the REDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> A discussion of standing timber and other vegetative cover in proposed recreation areas and other areas above the conservation pool which have recreation or scenic value. Recommendations should be made as to the significance of such timber and cover and as to whether reservation of standing timber should be permitted in the various parts of the fee area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> A map(s) showing the area which is the subject of the REDM, indicating the acquisition guide line, contour line, the tentative blocked out fee line, multipurpose pool, and lands in which the acquisition of easements is recommended. The map(s) will show, where appropriate, the dam site, construction area, borrow areas, spoil areas, public access areas, fish and wildlife areas, and recreation areas. In addition, the appropriate map(s) will have outlined thereon the items of construction or major project features. Access roads and railroad rights-of-way required for these areas will also be shown. Chapter 3 of ER 405-1-12 relates to the preparation of maps. With respect to a project where it is planned to submit several REDMs covering portions of the project, the initial REDM will contain a map showing the entire project, with the information shown thereon as indicated above, insofar as this information covering the entire

project is then available. All subsequent REDMs will contain the same type of map, on which will be shown the area(s) on which REDMs have been previously submitted with each such area keyed to the number of its REDM. Maps shall be of sufficient scale to be legible and to permit ready interpretation of pertinent features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> An aerial mosaic, if available, to provide a pictorial support to the rest of the report concerning involved problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Discussion relating to the acquisition or relocation of towns and cemeteries within the project area (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> A realistic estimate of administrative costs, giving due recognition to existing and foreseeable conditions. To assure direct relationship between costs and estimates, the breakdown of these estimates will conform to the prescribed acquisition activity cost items as set forth under Real Estate Schedule/Cost and Performance, ENG Form 4564, or any further breakdown which the District Engineer may consider desirable. Included as a minimum requirement will be: Estimated administrative costs for mapping, surveying, and boundary monumentation, appraising, title evidence, negotiating and closing direct purchases, condemnation, and relocation assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> Summary of project real estate costs, total all project real estate costs by category, i.e., land cost, improvements, severance, Pub. L. 91-646 costs, relocations, minerals, contingencies, administrative costs, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> Schedule of acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> Discussion and recommendations concerning the nonstandard estates proposed for acquisition and the real property boundary lines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(R)</em> The extent of the existing navigational servitude (ER 1165-2-302).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(S)</em> The REDMs will be assigned a single basic number for each project; succeeding REDMs will be given alphabetical suffixes to the basic assigned number--for example, REDM Nos. 5, 5A, 5B, etc. Copies of the letter of transmittal and indorsements thereon will be inserted in the front of each copy of the REDM. A cover sheet will list chronologically all REDMs (including supplements thereto and brief letter-type memoranda) previously submitted, and will show dates submitted by the District Engineer and, if approved, dates of approval thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon approval of each REDM, the Division or District Engineer may, subject to the availability of funds, proceed with the acquisition of land and/or interests therein. The REDM, as approved, will constitute the overall real estate plan for acquisition of the area covered by the REDM. Whenever changes in the approved REDM are required, a supplementary REDM describing the proposed changes and setting forth the reasons therefor will be submitted. Approval of a supplemental REDM is required before acquisition can proceed in the area in which the changes are proposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior to the approval of the REDM, Division and District Engineers should, subject to the availability of funds, proceed with preliminary real estate work, in the same manner as set out in Sec. 644.30. No action will be taken to solicit an offer from a landowner for the purchase of his land until the acquisition has been approved and subject to availability of funds and compliance with the applicable provisions of Pub. L. 91-646.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An REDM is not required for projects authorized by the Congress subject to the condition that local interests furnish without cost to the United States the necessary lands, easements, and rights-of-way. However, the GDM should include a statement enumerating the requirements of local cooperation, the name of the local interests proposing to fulfill said requirements, an estimate of land costs, and any other information pertinent thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Number and content of Real Estate Design Memorandum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to reservoir projects involving an extensive real estate program, it is considered preferable that more than one REDM be prepared so that each will cover a segment or group of segments, making up the total project, consistent with the planned schedule of acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For those projects, requiring two or more REDMs to cover the project area, each REDM will include all contiguous lands for each public access

point and recreational site proposed within the area covered by that REDM. Noncontiguous areas planned for these purposes that are located beyond the limits of the REDM involved will be omitted therefrom. This procedure does not apply to areas authorized for fish and wildlife purposes. Lands authorized specifically for fish and wildlife purposes may be included either in a conventional REDM, along with other project lands or be submitted as a separate REDM, depending on convenience in preparation and size of the area. However, in either event, whenever practicable, the entire area proposed for this purpose should be covered in one REDM, as a unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For smaller projects, not involving an extensive real estate program, all real estate requirements, including those for public access, fish and wildlife, and recreation, may be covered in a single REDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Blocking out. The following are guidelines to be observed to the extent possible in preparing the REDM. These guidelines will be adhered to by the Division Engineer in his approval of the final real estate acquisition lines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Close blocking out will be accomplished in accordance with sound real estate practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For land acquired in fee, the blocked out final real estate acquisition line will be established in such manner as to minimize costs and cause the least disruption in the use of the remainder of the ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Severance damages will be avoided to the extent possible consistent with real estate requirements for the project. In accordance with section 301 of Pub. L. 91-646, if the acquisition of part of a tract will render the remainder an uneconomic unit, an offer must be made to purchase the entire tract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is conceivable that, in certain instances, acquisition of an easement will result in an uneconomic remainder and this requires application of section 301 of Pub. L. 91-646, as in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A remnant without access need not be acquired if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner desires to retain the property and releases the Government from damages for lack of access, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The obtaining of such release in lieu of acquisition is concurred in, in writing, by the local road authority, and the local road authority is released from damages due to loss of access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For lands to be acquired in fee or easements, close tangent will be used, generally following the acquisition line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When small portions of additional properties, not otherwise needed for the project, are within the acquisition line, they may be omitted if to do so will not materially affect the operation and maintenance of the project as determined by operational elements.</p>
