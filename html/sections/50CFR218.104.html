                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When conducting training and utilizing the sound sources or  explosives identified in Sec.  218.100(c), the mitigation measures  contained in a Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec.  216.106  and 218.107 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation  measures include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personnel Training:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All commanding officers (COs), executive officers (XOs),  lookouts, Officers of the Deck (OODs), junior OODs (JOODs), maritime  patrol aircraft aircrews, and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW)/Mine Warfare  (MIW) helicopter crews shall complete the NMFS-approved Marine Species  Awareness Training (MSAT) by viewing the U.S. Navy MSAT digital  versatile disk (DVD). All bridge lookouts shall complete both parts one  and two of the MSAT; part two is optional for other personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to  qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training  Handbook (Naval Education and Training Command [NAVEDTRA] 12968-D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under  the supervision of a qualified, experienced lookout. Following  successful completion   of this supervised training period, lookouts shall complete the Personal  Qualification Standard Program, certifying that they have demonstrated  the necessary skills (such as detection and reporting of partially  submerged objects). Personnel being trained as lookouts can be counted  among required lookouts as long as supervisors monitor their progress  and performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure  quick and effective communication within the command structure in order  to facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species  are spotted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> All lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events  will review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training material  prior to use of MFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All COs, XOs, and officers standing watch on the bridge will  review the Marine Species Awareness Training material prior to a  training event employing the use of MFAS/HFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General Operating Procedures (for all training types):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation  Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall  be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and  general marine species protective measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and  information to limit interaction with marine mammals to the maximum  extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two  lookouts with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one  lookout with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of  navigation and man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this  requirement. As part of their regular duties, lookouts will watch for  and report to the OOD the presence of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On surface vessels equipped with a multi-function active  sensor, pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20 x 110) binoculars shall be  properly installed and in good working order to assist in the detection  of marine mammals in the vicinity of the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures  employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training  Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night  Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook  (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times,  use extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'', which means the  speed at which the CO can maintain crew safety and effectiveness of  current operational directives, so that the vessel can take action to  avoid a collision with any marine mammal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy  vessels shall increase vigilance and take all reasonable actions to  avoid collisions and close interaction of naval assets and marine  mammals. Such action may include changing speed and/or direction and are  dictated by environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Navy aircraft participating in exercises at-sea shall conduct  and maintain surveillance for marine mammals as long as it does not  violate safety constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of  primary operational duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> All marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to  assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the  vicinity of the marine species as appropriate when it is reasonable to  conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of  the distance to the detected marine mammal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Naval vessels will maneuver to keep at least 1,500 ft (500 yds)  away from any observed whale in the vessel's path and avoid approaching  whales head-on. These requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is  threatened, such as when change of course will create an imminent and  serious threat to a person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent  vessels are restricted in their ability to maneuver. Restricted  maneuverability includes, but is not limited to, situations when vessels  are engaged in dredging, submerged activities,   launching and recovering aircraft or landing craft, minesweeping  activities, replenishment while underway and towing activities that  severely restrict a vessel's ability to deviate course. Vessels will  take reasonable steps to alert other vessels in the vicinity of the  whale. Given rapid swimming speeds and maneuverability of many dolphin  species, naval vessels would maintain normal course and speed on  sighting dolphins unless some condition indicated a need for the vessel  to maneuver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operating Procedures (for Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW)  Operations):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least  three people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface  around the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All surface ships participating in ASW training events shall  have, in addition to the three personnel on watch noted in (i), at least  two additional personnel on watch as lookouts at all times during the  exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge will  have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to aid in  the detection of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for reporting all  objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance  from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, since any object or  disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface disturbance, discoloration)  in the water may be indicative of a threat to the vessel and its crew or  indicative of a marine mammal that may need to be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation  (including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for  marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine  mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and  appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> During MFAS operations, personnel shall utilize all available  sensor and optical systems (such as night vision goggles) to aid in the  detection of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive  capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 yds  (183 m) of the sonobuoy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW  exercise for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping)  sonar in the water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Helicopters shall not dip their sonar within 200 yards of a  marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes within  200 yards after pinging has begun.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means  (aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure  that sonar transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal  operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 1000 yards  (914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow) (i.e., limit to at most 229 dB for  AN/SQS-53 and 219 dB for AN/SQS-56, etc.). Ships and submarines shall  continue to limit maximum transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until  the animal has been seen to leave the 1000-yd safety zone, has not been  detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds  (1829 m) beyond the location of the last detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft,  shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar  transmission levels are limited to at least 10 dB below normal operating  levels if any detected marine mammals are within 500 yards (457 m) of  the sonar dome (the bow). Ships and submarines shall continue to limit  maximum ping levels by this 10-dB factor until the animal has been seen  to leave the 500-yd safety zone, has not been detected for 30 minutes,  or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the  location of the last detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft,  shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar  transmission ceases if any detected marine mammals are within 200 yards  (183 m) of the sonar dome (the bow). Sonar shall not resume until the  animal has been seen to leave the 200-yd safety zone, has not been  detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more   than 2,000 yds (457 m) beyond the location of the last detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only:  If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with  dolphins or porpoises, the OOD concludes that dolphins or porpoises are  deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further  mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises  continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators will  check that the 1000-m Safety Zone radius around the sound source is  clear of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Active sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate active  sonar at the lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as  required to meet tactical training objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Submarine sonar operators will review detection indicators of  close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training  events involving MFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the need for power-down should arise (as detailed in  218.114(a)(3)(x)) when the Navy is operating a hull-mounted or sub- mounted source above 235 dB (infrequent), the Navy shall follow the  requirements as though they were operating at 235 dB--the normal  operating level (i.e., the first power-down will be to 229 dB,  regardless of at what level above 235 dB active sonar was being  operated).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operating Procedures for Underwater Detonations (up to 10-lb  charges):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exclusion Zones--All demolitions and ship mine countermeasures  training exercises involving the use of explosive charges must include  exclusion zones for marine mammals to prevent physical and/or acoustic  effects to those species. These exclusion zones shall extend in a 700- yard arc radius around the detonation site. Should a marine mammal be  present within the surveillance area, the explosive event shall not be  started until the animal leaves the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-Exercise Surveys--For Demolition and Ship Mine  Countermeasures Operations, pre-exercise surveys shall be conducted for  30 minutes prior to the commencement of the scheduled explosive event.  The survey may be conducted from the surface, by divers, and/or from the  air, and personnel shall be alert to the presence of any marine mammal.  Should such an animal be present within the survey area, the explosive  event shall not be started until the animal voluntarily leaves the area.  The Navy will ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for a full 30  minutes prior to initiating the explosive event. Personnel will record  any marine mammal observations during the exercise as well as measures  taken if species are detected within the exclusion zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Post-Exercise Surveys--Surveys within the same exclusion zone  radius shall also be conducted within 30 minutes after the completion of  the explosive event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reporting--If there is evidence that a marine mammal may have  been stranded, injured or killed by the action, Navy training activities  shall be immediately suspended and the situation immediately reported by  the participating unit to the Officer in Charge of the Exercise (OCE),  who will follow Navy procedures for reporting the incident to Commander,  Pacific Fleet, Commander, Navy Region Marianas, Environmental Director,  and the chain-of-command. The situation shall also be reported to NMFS  (see Stranding Plan for details).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sinking Exercise:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour  after official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.0 nm (1.9 km) will be  established around each target. An additional buffer of 0.5 nm (0.9 km)  will be added to account for errors, target drift, and animal movements.  Additionally, a safety zone, which will extend beyond the buffer zone by  an additional 0.5 nm (0.9 km), shall be surveyed. Together, the zone  extends out 2 nm (3.7 km) from the target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted  within the 2-nm zone around the target, prior to and during the  exercise, when feasible. Survey protocol shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Overflights within the 2-nm zone around the target shall be  conducted in a manner that optimizes the surface area of the water  observed. This may be accomplished through the use of the Navy's Search  and Rescue Tactical Aid, which provides the best search altitude, ground  speed, and track spacing for the discovery of small, possibly dark  objects in the water based on the environmental conditions of the day.  These environmental conditions include the angle of sun inclination,  amount of daylight, cloud cover, visibility, and sea state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy  personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the  mitigation team will have completed the Navy's marine mammal training  program for lookouts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In addition to the overflights, the 2-nm zone around the target  shall be monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available.  This passive acoustic monitoring would be maintained throughout the  exercise. Additionally, passive sonar onboard submarines may be utilized  to detect any vocalizing marine mammals in the area. The OCE will be  informed of any aural detection of marine mammals and will include this  information in the determination of when it is safe to commence the  exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 2-nm  zone around the target shall commence 2 hours prior to the first firing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall  be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing may  commence until the OCE declares this 2-nm zone around the target is free  of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If a marine mammal is observed within the 2-nm zone around the  target, firing will be delayed until the animal is re-sighted outside  the 2-nm zone around the target, or 30 minutes have elapsed. After 30  minutes, if the animal has not been re-sighted it can be assumed to have  left the 2-nm zone around the target. The OCE will determine if the  marine mammal is in danger of being adversely affected by commencement  of the exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 2-nm  zone around the target shall again be surveyed for any marine mammal. If  marine mammals are sighted within the 2-nm zone around the target, the  OCE shall be notified, and the procedures described in this section  shall be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 2-nm  zone around the target shall be monitored for 2 hours, or until sunset,  to verify that no marine mammals were harmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Aerial surveillance shall be conducted using helicopters or  other aircraft based on necessity and availability. The Navy has several  types of aircraft capable of performing this task; however, not all  types are available for every exercise. For each exercise, the available  asset best suited for identifying objects on and near the surface of the  ocean shall be used. These aircraft shall be capable of flying at the  slow safe speeds necessary to enable viewing of marine vertebrates with  unobstructed, or minimally obstructed, downward and outward visibility.  The exclusion and safety zone surveys may be cancelled in the event that  a mechanical problem, emergency search and rescue, or other similar and  unexpected event preempts the use of one of the aircraft onsite for the  exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Every attempt shall be made to conduct the exercise in sea  states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, Beaufort Sea State 3  or less. In the event of a 4 or above, survey efforts shall be increased  within the 2-nm zone around the target. This shall be accomplished  through the use of an additional aircraft, if available, and conducting  tight search patterns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The exercise shall not be conducted unless the 2-nm zone around  the target could be adequately monitored visually. Should low cloud  cover or surface visibility prevent adequate visual monitoring as  described previously, the exercise would be delayed until conditions  improved, and all of the above monitoring criteria could be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> In the event that any marine mammals are observed to be harmed  in the area, a detailed description of the animal shall be taken, the  location   noted, and if possible, photos taken of the marine mammal. This  information shall be provided to NMFS via the Navy's regional  environmental coordinator for purposes of identification (see the  Stranding Plan for detail).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> An after action report detailing the exercise's time line,  the time the surveys commenced and terminated, amount, and types of all  ordnance expended, and the results of survey efforts for each event  shall be submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (up to 5-inch Explosive Rounds):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For exercises using targets towed by a vessel, target-towing  vessels shall maintain a trained lookout for marine mammals when  feasible. If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity, the tow vessel  will immediately notify the firing vessel, which will suspend the  exercise until the area is clear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A 600 yard (585 m) radius buffer zone will be established  around the intended target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From the intended firing position, trained lookouts will  survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and  during the exercise as long as practicable. Due to the distance between  the firing position and the buffer zone, lookouts are only expected to  visually detect breaching whales, whale blows, and large pods of  dolphins and porpoises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exercise will be conducted only when the buffer zone is  visible and marine mammals are not detected within it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (non-explosive rounds):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around  the intended target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From the intended firing position, trained lookouts shall  survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and  during the exercise as long as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If available, target towing vessels shall maintain a lookout  (unmanned towing vessels will not have a lookout available). If a marine  mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow vessel shall  immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure gunnery firing  until the area is clear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is  visible and marine mammals are not detected within the target area and  the buffer zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Surface-to-Air Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Vessels will orient the geometry of gunnery exercises in order  to prevent debris from falling in the area of sighted marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels will attempt to recover any parachute deploying aerial  targets to the extent practicable (and their parachutes if feasible) to  reduce the potential for entanglement of marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Target towing aircraft shall maintain a lookout if feasible.  If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow  aircraft will immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure  gunnery firing until the area is clear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Air-to-Surface Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A 200 yard (183 m) radius buffer zone will be established around  the intended target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If surface vessels are involved, lookout(s) will visually  survey the buffer zone for marine mammals to and during the exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aerial surveillance of the buffer zone for marine mammals will  be conducted prior to commencement of the exercise. Aerial surveillance  altitude of 500 feet to 1,500 feet (152-456 m) is optimum. Aircraft  crew/pilot will maintain visual watch during exercises. Release of  ordnance through cloud cover is prohibited; aircraft must be able to  actually see ordnance impact areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not  visible within the buffer zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Small Arms Training (Grenades, Explosive and Non-explosive  Rounds)--Lookouts will visually survey for marine mammals. Weapons will  not be fired in the direction of known or observed marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Air-to-Surface At-sea Bombing Exercises (explosive bombs and  rockets):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts shall survey  for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within  1,000 yds (914   m) of known or observed marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A 1,000 yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established  around the intended target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for  marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the  impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (152 m) or lower, if  safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. When safety or other  considerations require the release of weapons without the releasing  pilot having visual sight of the target area, a second aircraft, the  ``wingman,'' will clear the target area and perform the clearance and  observation functions required before the dropping plane may release its  weapons. Both planes must have direct communication to assure immediate  notification to the dropping plane that the target area may have been  fouled by encroaching animals or people. The clearing aircraft will  assure it has visual site of the target area at a maximum height of 1500  ft. The clearing plane will remain within visual sight of the target  until required to clear the area for safety reasons. Survey aircraft  shall employ most effective search tactics and capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not  visible within the buffer zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Air-to-Surface At-Sea Bombing Exercises (Non-explosive Bombs  and Rockets):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts will survey  for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within  1,000 yards (914 m) of known or observed or marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A 1,000 yard (914 m) radius buffer zone will be established  around the intended target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aircraft will visually survey the target and buffer zone for  marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the  impact area will be made by flying at 1,500 feet (456 m) or lower, if  safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. When safety or other  considerations require the release of weapons without the releasing  pilot having visual sight of the target area, a second aircraft, the  ``wingman,'' will clear the target area and perform the clearance and  observation functions required before the dropping plane may release its  weapons. Both planes must have direct communication to assure immediate  notification to the dropping plane that the target area may have been  fouled by encroaching animals or people. The clearing aircraft will  assure it has visual site of the target area at a maximum height of 1500  ft. The clearing plane will remain within visual sight of the target  until required to clear the area for safety reasons. Survey aircraft  shall employ most effective search tactics and capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals and are  not visible within the buffer zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (explosive and non-explosive):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Aircraft will visually survey the target area for marine  mammals. Visual inspection of the target area will be made by flying at  1,500 (457 m) feet or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest safe  speed. Firing or range clearance aircraft must be able to actually see  ordnance impact areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800  yds (1646 m) of sighted marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Aircraft Training Activities Involving Non-Explosive Devices:</p><p class="depth0">An exclusion zone of 200 yds around the target location, therefore,  shall be clear of marine mammals. Pre- and post-surveillance and  reporting requirements outlined for underwater detonations shall be  implemented during Mining Training Activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging and  Advanced Extended Echo-ranging (EER/IEER/AEER)--The following mitigation  measures shall be used with the employment of IEER/AEER sonobuoys:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area prior  to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search shall be  conducted at an altitude below 500 yd (457 m) at a slow speed, if  operationally feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft  operations, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), crews shall conduct a minimum of 30  minutes of visual and aural monitoring of the search area prior to  commanding the   first post detonation. This 30-minute observation period may include  pattern deployment time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For any part of the intended sonobuoy pattern where a post  (source/receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 1,000 yd (914 m)  of observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the receiver  ONLY (i.e., not the source) and monitor while conducting a visual  search. When marine mammals are no longer detected within 1,000 yd (914  m) of the intended post position, the source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A/SSQ- 125) will be co-located with the receiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When operationally feasible, Navy crews shall conduct  continuous visual and aural monitoring of marine mammal activity. This  shall include monitoring of own-aircraft sensors from the time of the  first sensor placement until the aircraft have left the area and are out  of RF range of these sensors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Aural Detection. If the presence of marine mammals is detected  aurally, then that shall cue the Navy aircrew to increase the diligence  of their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are  visually detected, then the crew may continue multi-static active  search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Visual Detection. If marine mammals are visually detected  within 1,000 yd (914 m) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A/ SSQ-125) intended for use, then that payload shall not be activated.  Aircrews may utilize this post once the marine mammals have not been re- sighted for 30 minutes, or are observed to have moved outside the 1,000  yd (914 m) safety buffer. Aircrews may shift their multi-static active  search to another post, where marine mammals are outside the 1,000 yd  (914 m) safety buffer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), aircrews shall make every attempt to  manually detonate the unexploded charges at each post in the pattern  prior to departing the operations area by using the ``Payload 1  Release'' command followed by the ``Payload 2 Release'' command.  Aircrews shall refrain from using the ``Scuttle'' command when two  payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews shall ensure that a 1,000 yd  (914 m) safety buffer, visually clear of marine mammals, is maintained  around each post as is done during active search operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in  the event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or  when an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as  fuel constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In these  cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive  source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported  as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then  upon landing via naval message.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own- aircraft sensor range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> The Navy shall implement the ``Stranding Response Plan for  Major Navy Training Exercises in the MIRC'' (available at: http:// www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental.htm), which is incorporated  herein by reference, including the following measures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shutdown Procedures. When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE-- defined in Sec.  216.271) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE)  (as defined in the Stranding Plan, meaning including Multi-strike group  exercises, Joint Expeditionary exercises, and Marine Air Ground Task  Force exercises in the MIRC), the Navy shall implement the procedures  described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined in the Stranding  Response Plan for MIRC) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected  Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the MIRC Stranding  Communication Protocol that a USE (as defined in the Stranding Response  Plan for MIRC) involving live animals has been identified and that at  least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and Navy shall  communicate, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the  potential need to implement shutdown procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area  until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area  die or   are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at that  area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the Navy finds an injured or dead marine mammal floating at  sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as  operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS  with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the  animal(s) including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead,  location, time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and  photo or video of the animals (if available). Based on the information  provided, NMFS shall determine if, and advise the Navy whether, a  modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In the event, following a USE, that: (a) Qualified individuals  are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals  are not willing to leave, or (b) animals are seen repeatedly heading for  the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall  coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic  stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS/HFAS  activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nm from the  distressed animal(s), is likely decreasing the likelihood that the  animals return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy shall further  coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to further minimize  that likelihood and implement those measures as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a  USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the MIRC  Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of  acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using MFAS/ HFAS, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training  activities occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE  event. Information not initially available regarding the 80 nm (148 km),  72 hours, period prior to the event shall be provided as soon as it  becomes available. The Navy shall provide NMFS investigative teams with  additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
