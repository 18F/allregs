                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public information. Information on NRHM routing designations must be made available by the States and Indian tribes to the public in the form of maps, lists, road signs or some combination thereof. If road signs are used, those signs and their placements must comply with the provisions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), particularly the Hazardous Cargo signs identified as R14-2 and R14-3 shown in Section 2B-62 of that Manual. This publication may be accessed free of charge on the Internet at http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting and publishing requirements. Each State or Indian tribe, through its routing agency, shall provide information identifying all NRHM routing designations that exist within its jurisdiction to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Office of Enforcement and Compliance (MC-EC), 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001. States shall also submit to FMCSA the current name of the State agency responsible for NHRM highway routing designations. The State or Indian tribe shall include descriptions of these routing designations, along with the dates they were established. This information may also be published in each State's official register of State regulations. Information on any subsequent changes or new NRHM routing designations shall be furnished within 60 days after establishment to the FMCSA. This information will be available from the FMCSA, consolidated by the FMCSA, and published annually in whole or as updates in the Federal Register. Each State may also publish this information in its official register of State regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A State or Tribally-designated route is effective only after it is published in the Federal Register in FMCSA's Hazardous Materials Route Registry.
