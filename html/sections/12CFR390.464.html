                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Issuance of a Capital Directive--(1) Purpose. In addition to any other action authorized by law, the FDIC, may issue a capital directive to a State savings association that does not have an amount of capital satisfying its minimum capital requirement. Issuance of such a capital directive may be based on a State savings association's noncompliance with the risk-based capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement, the tangible capital requirement, or individual minimum capital requirement established under this subpart, by a written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), or as a condition for approval of an application. A capital directive may order a State savings association to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. In addition to any other action authorized by law, the FDIC, may issue a capital directive to a State savings association that does not have an amount of capital satisfying its minimum capital requirement. Issuance of such a capital directive may be based on a State savings association's noncompliance with the risk-based capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement, the tangible capital requirement, or individual minimum capital requirement established under this subpart, by a written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), or as a condition for approval of an application. A capital directive may order a State savings association to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Achieve its minimum capital requirement by a specified date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adhere to the compliance schedule for achieving its individual minimum capital requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Submit and adhere to a capital plan acceptable to the FDIC describing the means and a time schedule by which the State savings association shall reach its required capital level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Take other action, including but not limited to, reducing the State savings association's assets or its rate of liability growth, or imposing restrictions on the State savings association's payment of dividends, in order to cause the State savings association to reach its required capital level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Take any action authorized under Sec. 390.469(e); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Take a combination of any of these actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enforcement of capital directive. A capital directive issued under this section, including a plan submitted pursuant to a capital directive, is enforceable under 12 U.S.C. 1818 in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order which has become final under 12 U.S.C. 1818.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notice of intent to issue capital directive. The FDIC will determine whether to initiate the process of issuing a capital directive. The FDIC will notify a State savings association in writing by registered mail of its intention to issue a capital directive. Since a state-chartered savings association is involved, the FDIC will also notify and solicit comment from the appropriate state supervisor. The notice will state:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reasons for issuance of the capital directive and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed contents of the capital directive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Response to notice of intent. (i) A State savings association may respond

to the notice of intent by submitting its own compliance plan, or may propose an alternative plan. The response should also include any information that the State savings association wishes the FDIC to consider in deciding whether to issue a capital directive. The appropriate state supervisor may also submit a response. These responses must be in writing and be delivered within 30 days after the receipt of the notices. Such responses must be filed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 390.106 and 390.108. In its discretion, the FDIC may extend the time period for the response for good cause. The FDIC may, for good cause, shorten the 30-day time period for response by the insured State savings association:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A State savings association may respond

After the closing date of the State savings association's response period, or upon receipt of the State savings association's response, if earlier, the FDIC shall consider the State savings association's response and may seek additional information or clarification of the response. Thereafter, the FDIC will determine whether or not to issue a capital directive and, if one is to be issued, whether it should be as originally proposed or in modified form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Service and effectiveness. (i) Upon issuance, a capital directive will be served upon the State savings association. It will include or be accompanied by a statement of reasons for its issuance and shall address the responses received during the response period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon issuance, a capital directive will be served upon the State savings association. It will include or be accompanied by a statement of reasons for its issuance and shall address the responses received during the response period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A capital directive shall become effective upon the expiration of 30 days after service upon the State savings association, unless the FDIC determines that a shorter effective period is necessary either on account of the public interest or in order to achieve the capital directive's purpose. If the State savings association has consented to issuance of the capital directive, it may become effective immediately. A capital directive shall remain in effect and enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, it is stayed, modified, or terminated by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Change in circumstances. Upon a change in circumstances, a State savings association may submit a request to the FDIC to reconsider the terms of the capital directive or consider changes in the State savings association's capital plan issued under a directive for the State savings association to achieve its minimum capital requirement. If the FDIC believes such a change is warranted, the FDIC may modify the State savings association's capital requirement or may refuse to make such modification if it determines that there are not significant changes in circumstances. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the capital directive and capital plan shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Relation to other administrative actions. The FDIC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> May consider a State savings association's progress in adhering to any capital plan required under this section whenever such State savings association or any affiliate of such State savings association seeks approval for any proposal that would have the effect of diverting earnings, diminishing capital, or otherwise impeding such State savings association's progress in meeting its minimum capital requirement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> May disapprove any proposal referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the FDIC determines that the proposal would adversely affect the ability of the State savings association on a current or pro forma basis to satisfy its capital requirement.</p>
