                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request. Parties who wish to obtain subpoenas that would require  the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or subpoenas that would  require the production of documents or other evidence under 5 U.S.C.  1204(b)(2)(A), should file their motions for those subpoenas with the  judge. The Board has authority under 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(2)(A) to issue a  subpoena requiring the attendance and testimony of any individual  regardless of location and for the production of documentary or other  evidence from any place in the   United States, any territory or possession of the United States, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. Subpoenas are  not ordinarily required to obtain the attendance of Federal employees as  witnesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form. Parties requesting subpoenas must file their requests, in  writing, with the judge. Each request must identify specifically the  books, papers, or testimony desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relevance. The request must be supported by a showing that the  evidence sought is directly material to the issues involved in the  appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rulings. Any judge who does not have the authority to issue  subpoenas will refer the request to an official with authority to rule  on the request, with a recommendation for decision. The official to whom  the request is referred will rule on the request promptly. Judges who  have the authority to rule on these requests themselves will do so  directly.
