A State may use welfare data  as an additional factor in the allocation of targeted assistance funds  if it so chooses; however, a State may not assign a greater weight to  welfare data than it has assigned to population data in its allocation  formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total  award to the State is made available to the qualified county or  counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties  have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program  in the county's stead.</p>
