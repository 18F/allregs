An individual is considered to have exhausted COBRA continuation coverage if such coverage ceases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Due to the failure of the employer or other responsible entity to remit premiums on a timely basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> When the individual no longer resides, lives, or works in the service

area of an HMO or similar program (whether or not within the choice of the individual) and there is no other COBRA continuation coverage available to the individual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> When the individual incurs a claim that would meet or exceed a lifetime limit on all benefits and there is no other COBRA continuation coverage available to the individual.</p><p class="depth0">Condition means a medical condition.</p><p class="depth0">Creditable coverage means creditable coverage within the meaning of Sec. 2590.701-4(a).</p><p class="depth0">Dependent means any individual who is or may become eligible for coverage under the terms of a group health plan because of a relationship to a participant.</p><p class="depth0">Enroll means to become covered for benefits under a group health plan (that is, when coverage becomes effective), without regard to when the individual may have completed or filed any forms that are required in order to become covered under the plan. For this purpose, an individual who has health coverage under a group health plan is enrolled in the plan regardless of whether the individual elects coverage, the individual is a dependent who becomes covered as a result of an election by a participant, or the individual becomes covered without an election.</p><p class="depth0">Enrollment date means the first day of coverage or, if there is a waiting period, the first day of the waiting period. If an individual receiving benefits under a group health plan changes benefit packages, or if the plan changes group health insurance issuers, the individual's enrollment date does not change.</p><p class="depth0">Excepted benefits means the benefits described as excepted in Sec. 2590.732(c).</p><p class="depth0">First day of coverage means, in the case of an individual covered for benefits under a group health plan, the first day of coverage under the plan and, in the case of an individual covered by health insurance coverage in the individual market, the first day of coverage under the policy or contract.</p><p class="depth0">Genetic information has the meaning given the term in Sec. 2590.702-1(a)(3) of this Part.</p><p class="depth0">Group health insurance coverage means health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan.</p><p class="depth0">Group health plan or plan means a group health plan within the meaning of Sec. 2590.732(a).</p><p class="depth0">Group market means the market for health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan.

(For rules relating to special enrollment, see Sec. 2590.701-6.) If an individual ceases to be eligible for coverage under a plan, and then subsequently becomes eligible for coverage under the plan, only the individual's most recent period of eligibility is taken into account in determining whether the individual is a late enrollee under the plan with respect to the most recent period of coverage. Similar rules apply if an individual again becomes eligible for coverage following a suspension of coverage that applied generally under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Medical care means amounts paid for--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or amounts paid for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Transportation primarily for and essential to medical care referred to in paragraph (1) of this definition; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Insurance covering medical care referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Medical condition or condition means any condition, whether physical or mental, including, but not limited to, any condition resulting from illness, injury (whether or not the injury is accidental), pregnancy, or congenital malformation.

The child's placement for adoption with such person ends upon the termination of such legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Plan year means the year that is designated as the plan year in the plan document of a group health plan, except that if the plan document does not designate a plan year or if there is no plan document, the plan year is--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The deductible or limit year used under the plan;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> If the plan does not impose deductibles or limits on a yearly basis, then the plan year is the policy year;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> If the plan does not impose deductibles or limits on a yearly basis, and either the plan is not insured or the insurance policy is not renewed on an annual basis, then the plan year is the employer's taxable year; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> In any other case, the plan year is the calendar year.</p><p class="depth2">Preexisting condition exclusion means a limitation or exclusion of benefits (including a denial of coverage) based on the fact that the condition was present before the effective date of coverage (or if coverage is denied, the date of the denial) under a group health plan or group or individual health insurance coverage (or other coverage provided to federally eligible individuals pursuant to 45 CFR part 148), whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before that day. A preexisting condition exclusion includes any limitation or exclusion of benefits (including a denial of coverage) applicable to an individual as a result of information relating to an individual's health status before the individual's effective date of coverage (or if coverage is denied, the date of the denial) under a group health plan, or group or individual health insurance coverage (or other coverage provided to Federally eligible individuals pursuant to 45 CFR part 148), such as a condition identified as a result of a pre-enrollment questionnaire or physical examination given to the individual, or review of

medical records relating to the pre-enrollment period.</p><p class="depth2">Public health plan means public health plan within the meaning of Sec. 2590.701-4(a)(1)(ix).</p><p class="depth2">Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) means the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201, et seq.).</p><p class="depth2">Short-term, limited-duration insurance means health insurance coverage provided pursuant to a contract with an issuer that has an expiration date specified in the contract (taking into account any extensions that may be elected by the policyholder without the issuer's consent) that is less than 12 months after the original effective date of the contract.</p><p class="depth2">Significant break in coverage means a significant break in coverage within the meaning of Sec. 2590.701-4(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth2">Special enrollment means enrollment in a group health plan or group health insurance coverage under the rights described in Sec. 2590.701-6.</p><p class="depth2">State means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth2">State health benefits risk pool means a State health benefits risk pool within the meaning of Sec. 2590.701-4(a)(1)(vii).</p><p class="depth2">Waiting period means waiting period within the meaning of Sec. 2590.715-2708(b).
