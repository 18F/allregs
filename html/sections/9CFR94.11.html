                                Sec. 94.11  Restrictions on importation of meat and other animal
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The meat of ruminants or swine, and other animal products, and ship stores, airplane meals, and baggage containing such meat or animal products originating in any region listed as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may not be imported into the United States unless the requirements in this section, in addition to other applicable requirements of chapter III of this title, are met. However, meat and meat products that meet the requirements of Sec. 94.4 do not have to comply with the requirements of this section. As used in this section, the term ``other animal product'' means all parts of the carcass of any ruminant or swine, other than meat and articles regulated under part 95 or part 96 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regions listed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section have been declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease by APHIS as provided in Sec. 94.1(a) but supplement their national meat supply by the importation of fresh (chilled or frozen) meat of ruminants or swine from regions that APHIS considers to be affected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease as provided in Sec. 94.1(a); or have a common land border with regions considered to be affected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease; or import ruminants or swine from regions considered to be affected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Thus, the meat may be commingled with the fresh (chilled or frozen) meat of animals from an affected region, resulting in an undue risk of introducing rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease into the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of regions whose products are regulated under this section is maintained on the APHIS Web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/animals/animal--disease--status.shtml. Copies of the list will also be available via postal mail, fax, or email upon request to the Sanitary Trade Issues Team, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> APHIS will add a region to the list of those whose products are regulated under this section after conducting an evaluation of the region and determining that one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exists. APHIS will remove a region from the list upon conducting an evaluation of the region and determining that the circumstances in paragraph (a)(1) of this section no

longer exist or upon determining that rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists in the region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All meat or other animal product from such regions, whether in personal-use amounts or commercial lots (except that which has been fully cooked by a commercial method in a container hermetically sealed promptly after filling but before such cooking and sealing produced a fully sterilized product which is shelf-stable without refrigeration) shall have been prepared only in an inspected establishment that is eligible to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the regulations in Sec. 327.2, chapter III of this title, issued thereunder, and shall be accompanied by a Department-approved meat inspection certificate prescribed in Sec. 327.4 in chapter III of this title, or similar certificate approved by the Administrator, as adequate to effectuate the purposes of this section, regardless of the purpose or amount of product in the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional certification. Meat of ruminants or swine or other animal products from any region listed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be accompanied by additional certification by a full-time salaried veterinary official of the agency in the national government that is responsible for the health of the animals within that region. Upon arrival of the meat of ruminants or swine or other animal product in the United States, the certification must be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival. The certification must give the name and official establishment number of the establishment where the animals were slaughtered, and shall state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The slaughtering establishment is not permitted to receive animals that originated in, or have ever been in, or that have been aboard a means of conveyance at the time such means of conveyance called at or landed at a port in, a region designated under Sec. 94.1(a) as a region where rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The slaughtering establishment is not permitted to receive meat or other animal products derived from ruminants or swine which originated in such a rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease affected region, or meat or other animal products from a rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease free region transported through a rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease affected region except in containers sealed with serially numbered seals of the National Government of the noninfected region of origin;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The meat or other animal product covered by the certificate was derived from animals born and raised in a region listed under Sec. 94.1(a) as free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease and the meat or other animal product has never been in any region in which rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease existed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The meat or other animal product has been processed, stored, and transported to the means of conveyance that will bring the article to the United States in a manner to preclude its being commingled or otherwise in contact with meat or other animal products that do not comply with the conditions contained in this certificate.
