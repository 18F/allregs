                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests to obtain copies of any material maintained by the  Committee must be submitted in writing to the Executive Director at the  Committee's offices, Jefferson Plaza 2, Suite 10800, 1421 Jefferson  Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202-3259. The requester may in his  or her petition ask for a fee waiver if there is likely to be a charge  for the requested information. All requests for records shall be deemed  to have been made pursuant to the FOIA, regardless of whether the Act is  specifically mentioned. Failure to submit a request in accordance with  these procedures may delay the processing of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request must reasonably describe the records to enable agency  personnel to locate them with reasonable effort. Where possible, a  requester should supply specific information regarding dates, titles,  and other identification which will help to identify the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Committee determines that a request does not reasonably  describe the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and  extend to the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to  confer promptly with knowledgeable agency personnel to attempt to  identify the records he or she is seeking. The ``date of receipt'' in  such instances shall be the date of receipt of the amended or clarified  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to preclude the  Committee from honoring an oral request for information, but, if the  requester is dissatisfied with the response, the Committee official  involved shall advise the requester to submit a written request in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The ``date of receipt''  of such a request shall be the date of receipt of the written request.  For recordkeeping purposes, the Committee in   responding to an oral request for information may ask the requester to  confirm the oral request in writing.  [54 FR 15189, Apr. 17, 1989.
