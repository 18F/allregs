                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A fetal stethoscope is a device used for  listening to fetal heart sounds. It is designed to transmit the fetal  heart sounds not only through sound channels by air conduction, but also  through the user's head by tissue conduction into the user's ears. It  does not use ultrasonic energy. This device is designed to eliminate  noise interference commonly caused by handling conventional  stethoscopes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt  from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of  this chapter, subject to the limitations in Sec. 884.9.  [45 FR 12684-12720, Feb. 26, 1980, as amended at 66 FR 38809, July 25,  2001]</p>
