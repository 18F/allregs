                                Sec. 102-194.35  Should I create electronic Standard or Optional forms?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, you should create electronic Standard or Optional forms,  especially when forms are used to collect information from the public.  GSA will not approve a new or revision to a Standard or Optional form  unless an electronic form is being made available. Only forms covered by  Sec. 102-194.40 are exempt from this requirement. Furthermore, you  should to the extent possible, use electronic form products and services  that are based on open standards. However, the use of proprietary  products is permitted, provided that the end user is not required to  purchase a specific product or subscription to use the electronic  Standard or Optional form.</p>
