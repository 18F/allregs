                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To whom appeals should be submitted. A requester may submit an  administrative appeal to the FOIA Appeals Officer at Headquarters,  within 35 days after the date of notification described in Sec. 103.6  or the date of the letter transmitting the last records released,  whichever is later. A requester shall mail or personally deliver an  appeal to the United States Customs Service, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue,  NW., Washington, DC 20229.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of appeal. The Administrative appeal shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing and signed by the requester,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have conspicuously printed on the face of the envelope the words  ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonably describe, in accordance with Sec. 103.5(e), the  records to which the appeal relates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Set forth the address where the requester desires to be notified  of the determination on appeal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specify the date of the initial request and the date and control  number of the letter denying the initial request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Petition the FOIA Appeals Officer at Headquarters, to grant the  request for records and state any arguments in support thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of appeal. The Customs officer or employee who  receives an appeal shall stamp the date of receipt on the appeal and the  stamped date is the date of receipt for purposes of the appeal. FOIA  Appeals Officer at Headquarters, shall acknowledge and advise the  appellant of the date of receipt and of the date that a response is due  under this paragraph. The FOIA Appeals Officer shall affirm the initial  denial (in whole or in part) or grant the request for records and notify  the appellant of that determination by letter mailed within 20 days  (exclusive of Saturdays, Sunday, and legal public holidays) after the  date of receipt of the appeal,   unless extended pursuant to Sec. 103.8(a). The purpose of the letter of  denial is to inform the appellant of the reason for the denial and the  right to judicial review of that denial under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). If  the FOIA Appeals Officer is unable to act on an appeal within the 20-day  period (or any extension thereof pursuant to Sec. 103.8(a)), the FOIA  Appeals Officer shall send written notice of that fact to the appellant.  In those circumstances, an appellant is entitled to commence an action  in a district court as provided in Sec. 103.9 despite any continuation  in the processing of an appeal. However, the appellant may also be  invited, in the alternative, to agree to a voluntary extension of time  in which to decide the appeal. A voluntary extension does not waive the  right of the appellant to ultimately commence an action in a United  States district court on the appellant's request.
