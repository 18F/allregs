                            <p class="depth0">Terms defined in sections 313(b)(1)(c) and 329 of Title III and not explicitly defined herein are used with the meaning given in Title III. For the purpose of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Acts means Title III.</p><p class="depth0">Article means a manufactured item: (1) Which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end use functions dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which does not release a toxic chemical under normal conditions of processing or use of that item at the facility or establishments.</p><p class="depth0">Beneficiation means the preparation of ores to regulate the size (including crushing and grinding) of the product, to remove unwanted constituents, or to improve the quality, purity, or grade of a desired product.</p><p class="depth0">Boiler means an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion and having the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)(i)</em> The unit must have physical provisions for recovering and exporting thermal energy in the form of steam, heated fluids, or heated gases; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The unit must have physical provisions for recovering and exporting thermal energy in the form of steam, heated fluids, or heated gases; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The unit's combustion chamber and primary energy recovery sections(s) must be of integral design. To be of integral design, the combustion chamber and the primary energy recovery section(s) (such as waterwalls and superheaters) must be physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit. A unit in which the combustion chamber and the primary energy recovery section(s) are joined only by ducts or connections carrying flue gas is not integrally designed; however,

secondary energy recovery equipment (such as economizers or air preheaters) need not be physically formed into the same unit as the combustion chamber and the primary energy recovery section. The following units are not precluded from being boilers solely because they are not of integral design: process heaters (units that transfer energy directly to a process stream), and fluidized bed combustion units; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> While in operation, the unit must maintain a thermal energy recovery efficiency of at least 60 percent, calculated in terms of the recovered energy compared with the thermal value of the fuel; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> The unit must export and utilize at least 75 percent of the recovered energy, calculated on an annual basis. In this calculation, no credit shall be given for recovered heat used internally in the same unit. (Examples of internal use are the preheating of fuel or combustion air, and the driving of induced or forced draft fans or feedwater pumps); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The unit is one which the Regional Administrator has determined, on a case-by-case basis, to be a boiler, after considering the standards in Sec. 260.32 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Coal extraction means the physical removal or exposure of ore, coal, minerals, waste rock, or overburden prior to beneficiation, and encompasses all extraction-related activities prior to beneficiation. Extraction does not include beneficiation (including coal preparation), mineral processing, in situ leaching or any further activities.</p><p class="depth2">Customs territory of the United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth2">Disposal means any underground injection, placement in landfills/surface impoundments, land treatment, or other intentional land disposal.</p><p class="depth2">EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth2">Establishment means an economic unit, generally at a single physical location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.</p><p class="depth2">Facility means all buildings, equipment, structures, and other stationary items which are located on a single site or on contiguous or adjacent sites and which are owned or operated by the same person (or by any person which controls, is controlled by, or under common control with such person). A facility may contain more than one establishment.</p><p class="depth2">Full-time employee means 2,000 hours per year of full-time equivalent employment. A facility would calculate the number of full-time employees by totaling the hours worked during the calendar year by all employees, including contract employees, and dividing that total by 2,000 hours.</p><p class="depth2">Import means to cause a chemical to be imported into the customs territory of the United States. For purposes of this definition, to cause means to intend that the chemical be imported and to control the identity of the imported chemical and the amount to be imported.</p><p class="depth2">Indian Country means Indian country as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151.
