                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The intensities prescribed in this section must be provided by new equipment with light covers and color filters in place. Intensities must be determined with the light source operating at a steady value equal to the average luminous output of the source at the normal operating voltage of the rotorcraft. The light distribution and intensity of each position light must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forward and rear position lights. The light distribution and intensities of forward and rear position lights must be expressed in terms of minimum intensities in the horizontal plane, minimum intensities in any vertical plane, and maximum intensities in overlapping beams, within dihedral angles, L, R, and A, and must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intensities in the horizontal plane. Each intensity in the horizontal plane (the plane containing the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft and perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the rotorcraft), must equal or exceed the values in Sec. 29.1391.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intensities in any vertical plane. Each intensity in any vertical plane (the plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane) must equal or exceed the appropriate value in Sec. 29.1393 where I is the minimum intensity prescribed in Sec. 29.1391 for the corresponding angles in the horizontal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals. No intensity in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values in Sec. 29.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used with the use of main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima specified in Sec. Sec. 29.1391 and 29.1393 if the overlap intensities in relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal clarity.</p>
