                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application for review--(1) General. Applications shall be submitted to the appropriate DRB on DD Form 293, ``Application for Review of Discharge or Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States,'' with such other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the applicant's advantage to submit such documents with the application or within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DoD installations and regional offices of the

Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Applications shall be submitted to the appropriate DRB on DD Form 293, ``Application for Review of Discharge or Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States,'' with such other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the applicant's advantage to submit such documents with the application or within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DoD installations and regional offices of the

Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing. A motion or request for review must be made within 15 years after the date of discharge or dismissal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicant's responsibilities. An applicant may request a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Character of discharge. Block 7 of DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in character of discharge (for example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Other than Honorable Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only a person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level status may request a change from Other than Honorable Discharge to Entry Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does not have an Honorable Discharge shall be treated as a request for a change to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a specific change to another character of discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reason for discharge. Block 7 of DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for discharge. If an applicant does not request a specific change in the reason for discharge, the DRB shall presume that the request for review does not involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under its responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's discharge, the DRB shall change the reason for discharge if such a change is warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in block 7 of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a difference between an applicant's issue and the request in block 7, the DRB shall respond to the issue in the context of the action requested in block 7. In the case of a hearing, the DRB shall attempt to resolve the ambiguity under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Request for consideration of specific issues. An applicant may request the DRB to consider specific issues which, in the opinion of the applicant, form a basis for changing the character of or reason for discharge, or both. In addition to the guidance set forth in this section, applicants should consult the other sections in this part (particularly paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section and Secs. 70.9 and 70.10 before submitting issues for consideration by the DRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submission of issues on DD Form 293. Issues must be provided to the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Issues must be clear and specific. An issue must be stated clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Separate listing of issues. Each issue submitted by an applicant should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the issue is conveyed to the DRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Use of DD Form 293. DD Form 293 provides applicants with a standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, provide a basis for changing the discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be important by an applicant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a decisional issue under paragraph (e) of this section, and those matters submitted simply as background or supporting materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that the applicant later submits a complaint under Sec. 70.10(d)(1)(iii) concerning the decisional document;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an applicant's issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Incorporation by reference. If the applicant makes an additional written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the applicant may

incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly urged to set forth all such issues as a separate item at the beginning of the brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently has failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond to such an issue under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Effective date of the new Form DD 293. With respect to applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD Form 293, the DRB shall accept the application, but shall provide the applicant with a copy of the new form and advise the applicant that it will only respond to issues submitted on the new form in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relationship of issues to character of or reason for discharge. If the application applies to both character of and reason for discharge, the applicant is encouraged, but not required, to identify the issue as applying to the character of or reason for discharge (or both). Unless the issue is directed at the reason for discharge expressly or by necessary implication, the DRB will presume that it applies solely to the character of discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Relationship of issues to the standards for discharge review. The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in Sec. 70.9. The applicant is encouraged to review those standards before submitting any issue upon which the applicant believes a change in discharge should be based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Issues concerning the equity of the discharge. An issue of equity is a matter that involves a determination whether a discharge should by changed under the equity standards of Sec. 70.9. This includes any issue, submitted by the applicant in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, that is addressed to the discretionary authority of the DRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Issues concerning the propriety of a discharge. An issue of propriety is a matter that involves a determination whether a discharge should be changed under the propriety standards of Sec. 70.9. This includes an applicant's issue, submitted in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in which the applicant's position is that the discharge must be changed because of an error in the discharge pertaining to a regulation, statute, constitutional provision, or other source of law (including a matter that requires a determination whether, under the circumstances of the case, action by military authorities was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion). Although a numerical reference to the regulation or other sources of law alleged to have been violated is not necessarily required, the context of the regulation or a description of the procedures alleged to have been violated normally must be set forth in order to inform the DRB adequately of the basis for the applicant's position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The applicant's identification of an issue. The applicant is encouraged, but not required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the propriety or the equity to the discharge. This will assist the DRB in assessing the relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Citation of matter from decisions. The primary function of the DRB involves the exercise of dicretion on a case-by-case basis. See Sec. 70.9(b)(3). Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as the basis for a change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring the DRB's attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative material, the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting documents. If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an issue that sets

forth specific principles and facts from a specific cited decision, the following requirements apply with respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the ``Applicant's Issue'' portion of DD Form 293.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB, another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To ensure timely consideration of principles cited from unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces Discharge Review Board/Corrective Board Reading Room), applicants must provide the DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant portion of the treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles were discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be returned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(iv) (A), (B), and (C), the decisional document shall note the defect, and shall respond to the issue without regard to the citation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Identification by the DRB of issues submitted by an applicant. The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this section after a review of the materials noted under paragraph (c)(4), is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issues on DD Form 293. The DRB shall consider all items submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated therein) in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i). With respect to applications submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider all issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of the submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amendment of issues. The DRB shall not request or instruct an applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant. Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be confirmed in writing by the applicant. Nothing in this provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Limits the DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the meaning of such matter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Precludes the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon such questions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prevents the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Prevents the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's submission. The written information will state that the applicant's decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used against the applicant in the consideration of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional issues identified during a hearing. The following additional procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote the DRB's understanding of an applicant's presentation. If, before closing the case for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant has presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the DRB may so inform the applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB from developing its own decisional issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notification of possible bar to benefits. Written notification shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board for Correction of Military or Naval Records or the Veterans Administration may confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar to benefits based upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, the following applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conduct of reviews--(1) Members. As designated by the Secretary concerned, the DRB and its panels, if any,

shall consist of five members. One member of the DRB shall be designated as the president and may serve as a presiding officer. Other officers may be designated to serve as presiding officers for DRB panels under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Members. As designated by the Secretary concerned, the DRB and its panels, if any,

shall consist of five members. One member of the DRB shall be designated as the president and may serve as a presiding officer. Other officers may be designated to serve as presiding officers for DRB panels under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Locations. Reviews by a DRB will be conducted in the NCR and such other locations as designated by the Secretary concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Types of review. An applicant, upon request, is entitled to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Record review. A review of the application, available service records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hearing. A review involving an appearance before the DRB by the applicant or counsel or representative (or both).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicant's expenses. Unless otherwise specified by law or regulation, expenses incurred by the applicant, witnesses, counsel or representative will not be paid by the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Withdrawal of application. An applicant shall be permitted to withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Failure to appear at a hearing or respond to a scheduling notice. (i) Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary concerned, further opportunity for a hearing shall not be made available in the following circumstances to an applicant who has requested a hearing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary concerned, further opportunity for a hearing shall not be made available in the following circumstances to an applicant who has requested a hearing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When the applicant has been sent a letter containing the month and location of a proposed hearing and fails to make a timely response; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the applicant, after being notified by letter of the time and place of the hearing, fails to appear at the appointed time, either in person or by representative, without having made a prior, timely request for a continuation, postponement, or withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing, and the DRB shall complete its review of the discharge. Further request for a hearing shall not be granted unless the applicant can demonstrate that the failure to appear or respond was due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Continuance and postponements. (i) A continuance of a discharge review hearing may be authorized by the president of the DRB or presiding officer of the panel concerned, provided that such continuance is of reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a full and fair hearing. When a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A continuance of a discharge review hearing may be authorized by the president of the DRB or presiding officer of the panel concerned, provided that such continuance is of reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a full and fair hearing. When a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Postponements of scheduled reviews normally shall not be permitted other than for demonstrated good and sufficient reason set forth by the applicant in a timely manner, or for the convenience of the government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Reconsideration. A discharge review shall not be subject to reconsideration except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of the DRB;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the original discharge review did not involve a hearing and a hearing is now desired, and the provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section do not apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When changes in discharge policy are announced after an earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made expressly retroactive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When the DRB determines that policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a Service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded a respondent in such proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When an individual is to be represented by a counsel or representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration of the case by the DRB;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When the case was not previously considered under uniform standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and such application is made within 15 years after the date of discharge; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original review. The decision

whether evidence offered by an applicant in support of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, relevant, and was not available to the applicant at the time of the original review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the evidence considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison shows that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on matters concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request for reconsideration shall be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Availability of records and documents. (i) Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or their designated representatives may obtain copies of their military personnel records by submitting a General Services Administration Standard Form 180, ``Request Pertaining to Military Records,'' to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 62132. Once the application for discharge review (DD Form 293) is submitted, an applicant's military records are forwarded to the DRBs where they cannot be reproduced. Submission of a request for an applicant's military records, including a request under the Freedom of Information Act (32 CFR part 286) or Privacy Act (32 CFR part 286a) after the DD Form 293 has been submitted, shall result automatically in the temporary suspension of processing of the application for discharge review until the requested records are sent to an appropriate location for copying, are copied, and are returned to the headquarters of the DRB. Processing of the application shall then be resumed at whatever stage of the discharge review process is practicable. Applicants are encouraged to submit any request for their military records before applying for discharge review rather than after submitting DD Form 293, to avoid delays in processing of applications and scheduling of reviews. Applicants and their counsel also may examine their military personnel records at the site of their scheduled review before the hearing. DRBs shall notify applicants of the dates the records are available for examination in their standard scheduling information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or their designated representatives may obtain copies of their military personnel records by submitting a General Services Administration Standard Form 180, ``Request Pertaining to Military Records,'' to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 62132.

DRBs shall notify applicants of the dates the records are available for examination in their standard scheduling information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the DRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents that are under the cognizance of another government department, office, or activity, applications for such information must be made by the applicant to the cognizant authority. The DRB shall advise the applicant of the mailing address of the government department, office, or activity to which the request should be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the official records relevant to the discharge review are not available at the agency having custody of the records, the applicant shall be so notified and requested to provide such information and documents as may be desired in support of the request for discharge review. A period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed for such documents to be submitted. At the expiration of this period, the review may be conducted with information available to the DRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A DRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with appropriate modifications regarding classified material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In any case heard on request of an applicant, the DRB shall provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The DRB shall also notify the applicant or counsel or representative:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Of the right to examine such documents or to be provided with copies of the documents upon request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Of the date by which such requests must be received; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time to be set by the DRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the DRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document, deleting all references to sources of information and other matters, the disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would be detrimental to the national security interests of the United States. Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the classifying authority, information from the classified sources shall not be considered by the DRB in its review of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Regulations of a Military Department may be obtained at many installations under the jurisdiction of the Military Department concerned or by writing to the following address: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), room 1E520, Washington, DC 20310.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Recorder/Secretary or Assistant. Such a person shall be designated to assist in the functioning of each DRB in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Hearings. Hearings (including hearing examinations) that are conducted shall recognize the rights of the individual to privacy. Accordingly, presence at hearings of individuals other than those required shall be limited to persons authorized by the Secretary concerned or expressly requested by the applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space. If, in the opinion of the presiding officer, the presence of other individuals could be prejudicial to the interests of the applicant or the government, hearings may be held in closed session.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Evidence and testimony. (i) The DRB may consider any evidence obtained in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DRB may consider any evidence obtained in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Formal rules of evidence shall not be applied in DRB proceedings. The presiding officer shall rule on matters of procedure and shall ensure that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are maintained in the taking of evidence and presentation of witnesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Applicants undergoing hearings shall be permitted to make sworn or unsworn statements, if they so desire, or to introduce witnesses, documents, or other information on their behalf, at no expense to the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Applicants may also make oral or written arguments personally or through counsel or representatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Applicants who present sworn or unsworn statements and witnesses may be questioned by the DRB. All testimony shall be taken under oath or affirmation unless the applicant specifically requests to make an unsworn statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> There is a presumption of regularity in the conduct of governmental affairs. This presumption can be applied in any review unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decision process.

The presiding officer shall convene, recess, and adjourn the DRB panel as appropriate and shall maintain an atmosphere of dignity and decorum at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each DRB member shall act under oath or affirmation requiring careful, objective consideration of the application. DRB members are responsible for eliciting all facts necessary for a full and fair hearing. They shall consider all information presented to them by the applicant. In addition, they shall consider available Military Service and health records, together with other records that may be in the files of the Military Department concerned and relevant to the issues before the DRB, and any other evidence obtained in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The DRB shall identify and address issues after a review of the following material obtained and presented in accordance with this part and the implementing instructions of the DRB: Available official records, documentary

evidence submitted by or on behalf of an applicant, presentation of a hearing examination, testimony by or on behalf of an applicant, oral or written arguments presented by or on behalf of an applicant, and any other relevant evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If an applicant who has requested a hearing does not respond to a notification letter or does not appear for a scheduled hearing, the DRB may complete the review on the basis of material previously submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application of standards. (i) When a DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was improper (Sec. 70.9(b)), the DRB will determine which reason for discharge should have been assigned based upon the facts and circumstances before the discharge authority, including the Service regulations governing reasons for discharge at the time the applicant was discharged. Unless it is also determined that the discharge was inequitable (Sec. 70.9(c)), the provisions as to characterization in the regulation under which the applicant should have been discharged will be considered in determining whether further relief is warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When a DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was improper (Sec. 70.9(b)), the DRB will determine which reason for discharge should have been assigned based upon the facts and circumstances before the discharge authority, including the Service regulations governing reasons for discharge at the time the applicant was discharged.

An item submitted as an issue by an applicant in accordance with this part shall be addressed as a decisional issue under paragraph (e), in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the DRB decides that a change in discharge should be granted, and the DRB bases its decision in whole or in part on the applicant's issue; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the DRB does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, and the decision is based in whole or in part on the DRB's disagreement on the merits with an issue submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Response to items not addressed as decisional issues.

No further response is required to other issues submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the applicant receives the full change in discharge requested (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis shall be addressed as a decisional issue.

No further response is required to other issues submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge requested with respect to either the character of or reason for discharge (or both), the DRB shall address the items submitted by the applicant under paragraph (e) of this section (decisional issues) unless one of the following responses is applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Duplicate issues. The DRB may state that there is a full response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified decisional issue. This response may be used only when one issue clearly duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in conjunction with another issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Citations without principles and facts. The DRB may state that the applicant's issue, which consists of a citation to a decision without setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that the applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Unclear issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of the item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Nonspecific issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, cannot determine the relationship between the applicant's submission and the particular circumstances of the case. This response may be used only if the submission is expressed in such general terms that no other response is applicable. For example, if the DRB disagrees with the applicant as to the relevance of matters set forth in the submission, the DRB normally will set forth the nature of the disagreement under the guidance in paragraph (e) of this section, with respect to decisional issues, or it will reject the applicant's position on the basis of paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) or (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. If the applicant's submission is so general that none of those provisions is applicable, then the DRB may state that it cannot respond because the item is not specific.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Decisional issues--(1) General. Under the guidance in this section, the decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge.

Under the guidance in this section, the decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge. In order to enhance clarity, the DRB should not address matters other than issues relied upon in the decision or raised by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partial change. When the decision changes a discharge, but does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, the decisional document shall address both the issues upon which change is granted and the issues upon which the DRB denies the full change requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relationship of issue to character of or reason for discharge. Generally, the decisional document should specify whether a decisional issue applies to the character of or reason for discharge (or both), but it is not required to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Relationship of an issue to propriety or equity. (A) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to the propriety of the discharge (for example, by citing a propriety standard or otherwise claiming that a change in discharge is required as a matter of law), the DRB shall consider the issue solely as a matter of propriety. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(D) of this section, the DRB is not required to consider such an issue under the equity standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the applicant's issue contends that the DRB is required as a matter of law to follow a prior decision by setting forth an issue of propriety from the prior decision and describing its relationship to the applicant's case, the

issue shall be considered under the propriety standards and addressed under paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the applicant's issue sets forth principles of equity contained in a prior DRB decision, describes the relationship to the applicant's case, and contends that the DRB is required as a matter of law to follow the prior case, the decisional document shall note that the DRB is not bound by its discretionary decisions in prior cases under the standards in Sec. 70.9. However, the principles cited by the applicant, and the description of the relationship of the principles to the applicant's case, shall be considered under the equity standards and addressed under paragraph (e)(5) or (e)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the applicant's issue cannot be identified as a matter of propriety or equity, the DRB shall address it as an issue of equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change of discharge: issues of propriety. If a change in the discharge is warranted under the propriety standards in Sec. 70.9 the decisional document shall state that conclusion and list the errors of expressly retroactive changes in policy that provide a basis for the conclusion. The decisional document shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the error or change in policy to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not granting the full change shall be addressed under the guidance in paragraph (e)(3) or (e)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial of the full change requested: issues of propriety. (i) If the decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, or if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, or if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The decisional document shall list reasons for its conclusion on each issue of propriety under the following guidance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a regulation, statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the particular circumstances in the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, including a factor required by applicable Service regulations to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for the applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each such event or circumstance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a citation is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a finding of fact is made after consideration of contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional document shall set forth the conflicting evidence and explain why the information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall set forth the basis for relying on the presumption of regularity and explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of propriety, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the

applicant in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section) are not relevant to the applicant's case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The DRB may reject an applicant's position by stating that the applicant's issue of propriety is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge, and by providing an explanation for this position. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be considered in conjunction with one or more other specified issues, the explanation will address all such specified issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the applicant takes the position that the discharge must be changed because of an alleged error in a record associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, the DRB may respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective action. If the organization empowered to correct the record is within the Department of Defense, the DRB should provide the applicant with a brief description of the procedures for requesting correction of the record. If the DRB on its own motion cites this issue as a decisional issue on the basis of equity, it shall address the issue under paragraph (d)(5) or (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When an applicant's issue contains a general allegation that a certain course of action violated his or her constitutional rights, the DRB may respond in appropriate cases by noting that the action was consistent with statutory or regulatory authority, and by citing the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to statutes and regulations. If, on the other hand, the applicant makes a specific challenge to the constitutionality of the action by challenging the application of a statute or regulation in a particular set of circumstances, it is not sufficient to respond solely by citing the presumption of constitutionality of the statute or regulation when the applicant is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute or regulation. Instead, the response must address the specific circumstances of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Denial of the full change in discharge requested when propriety is not at issue. If the applicant has not submitted an issue of propriety and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of propriety to change the discharge, the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect. The DRB is not required to provide any further discussion as to the propriety of the discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Change of discharge: issues of equity. If the DRB concludes that a change in the discharge is warranted under the equity standards in Sec. 70.9 the decisional document shall list each issue of equity upon which this conclusion is based. The DRB shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the issue to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not giving the full change requested shall be discussed under the guidance in paragraph (e)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Denial of the full change in discharge requested: issues of equity.

If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall set forth the basis for relying on the presumption of regularity and explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of equity, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The DRB may reject an applicant's position by explaining why the applicant's issue is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge as a matter of equity.

However, the DRB will consider whether it should exercise its equitable powers to change the discharge on the basis of the alleged error. If it declines to do so, it shall explain why the applicant's position did not provide a sufficient basis for the change in the discharge requested by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When the DRB concludes that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors, the DRB must set forth reasons such as the seriousness of the offense, specific circumstances surrounding the offense, number of offenses, lack of mitigating circumstances, or similar factors.
