                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any provision of the ACH Rules, including 2.4.4,  2.8.4, 4.3.5, 2.92, 3.2.2, and 3.13.3, agencies shall be subject to the  obligations and liabilities set forth in this section in connection with  Government entries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receiving entries. An agency may receive ACH debit or credit  entries only with the prior written authorization of the Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liability to a recipient. An agency will be liable to the  recipient for any loss sustained by the recipient as a result of the  agency's failure to originate a credit or debit entry in accordance with  this part. The agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the  entry(ies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability to an originator. An agency will be liable to an  originator or an ODFI for any loss sustained by the originator or ODFI  as a result of the agency's failure to credit an ACH entry to the  agency's account in accordance with this part. The agency's liability  shall be limited to the amount of the entry(ies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liability to an RDFI or ACH association. Except as otherwise  provided in this part, an agency will be liable to an RDFI for losses  sustained in processing duplicate or erroneous credit and debit entries  originated by the agency. An agency's liability shall be limited to the  amount of the entry(ies) and shall be reduced by the amount of the loss  resulting from the failure of the RDFI to exercise due diligence and  follow standard commercial practices in processing the entry(ies). This  section does not apply to credits received by an RDFI after the death or  legal incapacity of a recipient of benefit payments or the death of a  beneficiary as governed by subpart B of this part. An agency shall not  be liable to any ACH association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acquittance of the agency. The final crediting of the amount of  an entry to a recipient's account shall constitute full acquittance of  the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reversals. An agency may reverse any duplicate or erroneous  entry, and the Federal Government may reverse any duplicate or erroneous  file. In initiating a reversal, an agency shall certify to the Service  that the reversal complies with applicable law related to the recovery  of the underlying payment. An agency that reverses an entry shall  indemnify the RDFI as provided in the applicable ACH Rules, but the  agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the entry. If the  Federal Government reverses a file, the Federal Government shall  indemnify the RDFI as provided in the applicable ACH Rules, but the  extent of such liability shall be limited to the amount of the entries  comprising the duplicate or erroneous file. Reversals under this section  shall comply with the time limitations set forth in the applicable ACH  Rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Point-of-purchase debit entries. An agency may originate a  Point-of-Purchase (POP) entry using a check drawn on a consumer or  business account and presented at a point-of-purchase. The requirements  of ACH Rules 2.3.2.2 and 2.5.10.1 shall be met for such an entry if the  Receiver presents the check at a location where the agency has posted  the notice required by the ACH Rules and has provided the Receiver with  a copy of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Return Fee Entry. An agency that has authority to collect  returned item service fees may do so by originating a Return Fee Entry  if the agency provides notice to the Receiver in accordance with the ACH  Rules.
