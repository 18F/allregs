                                Sec. 1420.9  FMCS deferral to parties' own private interest arbitration
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Service will defer to the parties' own privately agreed to interest arbitration procedure and decline to appoint a Board of Inquiry (BoI) as long as the parties' own procedure meets certain conditions so as to satisfy the Service's responsibilities under the Act. The Service will decline to appoint BoI if the parties to a dispute have agreed in writing to their own interest arbitration procedure which meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The interest arbitration procedure must provide that there can be no strike or lockout and no changes in conditions of employment (except by mutual agreement) during the contract negotiation covered by the interest arbitration procedure and the period of any subsequent interest arbitration proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It must provide that the award of the arbitrator(s) under the interest arbitration procedure is final and binding on both parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It must provide a fixed and determinate method for selecting the impartial interest arbitrator(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The interest arbitration procedure must provide for a written award by the interest arbitrator(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The parties to a dispute who have agreed to such an interest arbitration procedure should jointly submit a copy of their agreed upon procedure to the appropriate regional office of the Service at as early a date as possible, but in any event prior to the appointment of BoI by the Service. See Sec. 1420.5(f) for the addresses of regional offices.
These new regulations are a part of the Service's overall approach to implementing the health care amendments of 1974 in a manner consistent with the Congressional intent of promoting peaceful settlements of labor disputes at our vital health care facilities. The Service will work with the parties in every way possible to be flexible and to tailor its approach so as to accommodate the needs of the parties in the interest of settling the dispute. This was the motivating principle behind these new regulations which permit input by the parties to the Board of Inquiry selection and allow the parties to set up

their own factfinding or arbitration procedures in lieu of the Board of Inquiry procedure. We encourage the parties, both unions and management, to take advantage of these and other options and to work with the Service to tailor their approach and procedures to fit the needs of their bargaining situations.</p>
