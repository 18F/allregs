                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Misleading or inaccurate advertisements. An advertisement must  not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be misleading or inaccurate or misrepresent a credit union's  account agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refer to or describe an account as ``free'' or ``no cost'' or  contain a similar term if any maintenance or activity fee may be imposed  on the account. The word ``profit'' must not be used in referring to  dividends or interest paid on an account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permissible rates. If an advertisement states a rate of return,  it shall state the rate as an ``annual percentage yield,'' using that  term. (The abbreviation ``APY'' may be used provided the term ``annual  percentage yield'' is stated at least once in the advertisement.) The  advertisement shall not state any other rate, except that the ``dividend  rate,'' using that term, may be stated in conjunction with, but not more  conspicuously than, the annual percentage yield to which it relates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When additional disclosures are required. Except as provided in  paragraph (e) of this section, if the annual percentage yield is stated  in an advertisement, the advertisement shall state the following  information, to the extent applicable, clearly and conspicuously:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Variable rates. For variable-rate accounts, a statement that the  rate may change after the account is opened.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time annual percentage yield is offered. For interest-bearing  accounts and dividend-bearing term share accounts, the period of time  the annual percentage yield will be offered, or a statement that the  annual percentage yield is accurate as of a specified date. For  dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a statement  that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of the last dividend  declaration date. In the event that disclosure of an annual percentage  yield as of the last dividend declaration date might be inaccurate  because of known or contemplated dividend rate changes, the credit union  may disclose the prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective  annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, or in  addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the  last dividend declaration date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum balance. The minimum balance required to earn the  advertised annual percentage yield. For tiered-rate accounts, the  minimum balance required for each tier shall be stated in close  proximity and with equal prominence to the applicable annual percentage  yield.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minimum opening deposit. The minimum deposit required to open  the account, if it is greater than the minimum balance necessary to earn  the advertised annual percentage yield.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effect of fees. A statement that fees could reduce the earnings  on the account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Features of term share accounts. For term share accounts:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Time requirements. The term of the account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Early withdrawal penalties. A statement that a penalty will or  may be imposed for early withdrawal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Required dividend payouts. For noncompounding term share  accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that do not  compound dividends on an annual or more frequent   basis, that require dividend payouts at least annually, and that  disclose an APY determined in accordance with section E of appendix A of  this part, a statement that dividends cannot remain on account and that  payout of dividends is mandatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bonuses. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if  a bonus is stated in an advertisement, the advertisement shall state the  following information, to the extent applicable, clearly and  conspicuously:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ``annual percentage yield,'' using that term;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time requirements to obtain the bonus;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The minimum balance required to obtain the bonus;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The minimum balance required to open the account, if it is  greater than the minimum balance necessary to obtain the bonus; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the bonus will be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption for certain advertisements--(1) Certain media. If an  advertisement is made through one of the following media, it need not  contain the information in paragraphs (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (c)(2), (c)(4), (c)(5),  (c)(6)(ii), (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Broadcast or electronic media, such as television or radio;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outdoor media, such as billboards; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Telephone response machines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indoors signs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Signs inside the premises of a credit union  (or the premises of a share or deposit broker) are not subject to  paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a sign exempted by paragraph (e)(2) of this section states a  rate of return, it shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> State the rate as an ``annual percentage yield,'' using that  term or the term ``APY.'' The sign shall not state any other rate,  except that the dividend rate may be stated in conjunction with the  annual percentage yield to which it relates.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Contain a statement advising members to contact an employee for  further information about applicable fees and terms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Newsletters. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Newsletters sent by a credit union to existing  members only are not subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a newsletter exempted by paragraph (e)(3) of this section  states a rate of return, it shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> State the rate as an ``annual percentage yield,'' using that  term or the term ``APY.'' The newsletter shall not state any other rate,  except that the dividend rate may be stated in conjunction with the  annual percentage yield to which it relates.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Contain a statement advising members to contact an employee for  further information about applicable fees and terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional disclosures in connection with the payment of  overdrafts. Credit unions that promote the payment of overdrafts in an  advertisement must include in the advertisement the disclosures required  by Sec. 707.11(b) of this part.
