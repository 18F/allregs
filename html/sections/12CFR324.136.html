                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The positive current exposure of an FDIC-supervised institution for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the FDIC-supervised institution to the counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleared transactions that are subject to daily marking-to-market and daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions (which are addressed in Sec. Sec. 324.131 and 324.132);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts (which are addressed in Sec. Sec. 324.131 and 324.132); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts and addressed in Sec. Sec. 324.131 and 324.132).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System-wide failures. In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement or clearing system, or a central counterparty, the FDIC may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions. An FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The FDIC-supervised institution must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the FDIC-supervised institution by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to Sec. 324.136.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec. 324.136--Risk Weights for Unsettled DvP and PvP</p><p class="depth2">Transactions------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Risk weight to be</p><p class="depth2">Number of business days after contractual       applied to positive</p><p class="depth2">settlement date                      current exposure</p><p class="depth2">(in percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------From 5 to 15.......................................                100From 16 to 30......................................                625From 31 to 45......................................                937.546 or more.........................................              1,250------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus-payment) transactions. (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the FDIC-supervised institution has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The FDIC-supervised institution must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the FDIC-supervised institution has received its corresponding deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the FDIC-supervised institution has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The FDIC-supervised institution must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the FDIC-supervised institution has received its corresponding deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the business day after the FDIC-supervised institution has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the transaction by treating

the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC-supervised institution as a wholesale exposure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution may use a 45 percent LGD for the transaction rather than estimating LGD for the transaction provided the FDIC-supervised institution uses the 45 percent LGD for all transactions described in Sec. 324.135(e)(1) and (e)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution may use a 100 percent risk weight for the transaction provided the FDIC-supervised institution uses this risk weight for all transactions described in Sec. Sec. 324.135(e)(1) and (e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the FDIC-supervised institution has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after the counterparty delivery was due, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC-supervised institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions. Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.
