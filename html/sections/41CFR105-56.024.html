                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal  salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS)  administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the  Federal Government. This process is known as salary offset. Rules issued  by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal  agencies must follow prior to conducting salary offset and the  procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency. See 5  CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C.  5514(a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as  centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees  who owe delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary  offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent  debt records with records of Federal   employees. The purpose of centralized salary offset computer matching is  to identify those debtors whose Federal salaries should be offset to  collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An interagency consortium was established to implement  centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as  required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of  records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the  consortium.</p>
