                                Sec. 310.519  Drug products marketed as over-the-counter (OTC) daytime
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Antihistamines, bromides, and scopolamine compounds, either singly or in combinations, have been marketed as ingredients in over-the-counter (OTC) drug products for use as daytime sedatives. The following claims have been made for daytime sedative products: ``occasional simple nervous tension,'' ``nervous irritability,'' ``nervous tension headache,'' ``simple nervousness due to common every day overwork and fatigue,'' ``a relaxed feeling,'' ``calming down and relaxing,'' ``gently soothe away the tension,'' ``calmative,'' ``resolving that irritability that ruins your day,'' ``helps you relax,'' ``restlessness,'' ``when you're under occasional stress . . . helps you work relaxed.'' Based on evidence presently available, there are no ingredients that can be generally recognized as safe and effective for use as OTC daytime sedatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted as an OTC daytime sedative (or any similar or related indication) is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for which an approved new drug application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted as an OTC daytime sedative (or any similar or related indication) is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any OTC daytime sedative drug product introduced into interstate commerce after December 24, 1979, that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
