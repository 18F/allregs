                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the provisions of this part, a person may exercise  his or her right heretofore existing under law, to divide, sell,  transfer, rent, or lease his or her property if such division, sale,  transfer, rental arrangement, or lease is legally binding as between the  parties thereto. However, any document representing a division, sale,  transfer, rental arrangement, or lease which is fictitious or not  legally binding as between the parties thereto shall be considered to be  for the purpose of evading the payment limitation and shall be  disregarded for the purpose of applying the payment limitation. Any  change in farming operations that would otherwise serve to increase the  number of persons for application of the payment limitation must be bona  fide and substantive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A substantive change includes, for example, a substantial  increase or decrease in the size of the farm by purchase, sale, or  lease; a substantial increase or decrease in the size of allotment by  purchase, sale, or lease; a change from a cash lease to a share lease or  vice versa; and dissolution of an entity such as a corporation or  partnership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples of the types of changes that would not be considered as  substantive are the following:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A corporation is owned equally by four shareholders. The  corporation owns land, buildings, and equipment and in the prior year  carried out substantial farming operations. Three of the shareholders  propose forming a partnership which they would own equally. The  partnership would cash lease land and equipment from the corporation  with the objective of having the three partners considered as separate  persons for purposes of applying the payment limitation under the  provisions of Sec. 795.7 of the regulations.</p><p class="depth2">The formation of such a partnership and the leasing of land from a  corporation in which they hold a major interest would not constitute a  substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the  corporation and the partners would be limited to a single payment  limitation.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Three individuals each have individual farming operations  which, if continued unchanged, would permit them to have a total of  three payment limitations.</p><p class="depth2">The three individuals propose forming a corporation which they would  own equally. The corporation would then cash lease a portion of the  farmland owned and previously operated by the individuals with the  objective of having the corporation considered as a separate person for  purposes of applying the payment limitation under the provisions of  Sec. 795.8 of the regulations. The formation of such a corporation and  the leasing of land from the stockholders would not constitute a  substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the  corporation and the three individuals would be limited to three payment  limitations.</p>
