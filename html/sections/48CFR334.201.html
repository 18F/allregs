                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For acquisitions for development designated as major in accordance with both OMB Circular A-11 and HHS policy on major acquisitions; for acquisitions that involve substantial development, modification or enhancement; or for acquisitions that involve significant upgrade of operational or steady state systems or programs, use of an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is required as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For individual cost-reimbursement or fixed-price-incentive contracts (with incentive based on cost) valued at $10 million to $25 million, including options, full EVMS (as defined in 334.200) is required and the contractor's EVMS shall comply with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For individual firm-fixed-price, term form (level-of-effort) of any type, time-and-materials, or labor-hour contracts valued at $10 million to $25 million, including options, partial EVMS (as defined in 334.200) is required and the contractor's EVMS shall comply with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For individual cost-reimbursement or fixed-price-incentive contracts (with incentive based on cost) valued at more than $25 million, including options, full EVMS (as defined in 334.200) is required and the contractor's EVMS must be formally validated and accepted by the Government--i.e., the contractor's Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA), as defined in FAR 2.101 and described in FAR 42.003).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For individual firm-fixed-price, term form (level-of-effort) of any type, time-and-materials, or labor-hour contracts valued at more than $25 million, including options, partial EVMS (as defined in 334.200) is required and the contractor's EVMS must be formally validated and accepted by the Government--i.e., the contractor's CFA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For individual contracts of any type valued at less than $10 million, including options, full or partial EVM application, as appropriate to the contract type involved, is optional. The recommendation to use EVM should be based upon a risk analysis by the Program Manager/Project Officer. A decision to use EVM at this level requires the prior approval of the cognizant HCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EVM is not required, but may be applied with prior written approval of the HCA, on contracts of any dollar amount meeting either of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The acquisition is for non-developmental support services (e.g., program office support, Independent Verification & Validation services), steady state operations, basic and applied research, and routine services

(e.g., building maintenance, help-desk services, landscaping services).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract is for a commercial item(s) under FAR Part 12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When full EVM is required on a prime contract, it applies to subcontracts issued there under if those subcontracts have a value and are of a type and subject matter that would have required the use of full EVM had they been prime contracts. However, if the prime contract requires the use of only partial EVM, any subcontracts to which EVM is made applicable, because of dollar value, contract type or subject matter, shall require only partial EVM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When offerors are required to provide an EVMS plan as part of their proposals, the Contracting Officer shall request the assistance of the Project Officer (and/or an appropriate HHS-designated third party) in determining the adequacy of such proposed EVMS plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The selection or use of a particular contract type, if done only or primarily to avoid the application of full EVM to the acquisition is prohibited.</p>
