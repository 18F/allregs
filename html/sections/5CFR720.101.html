                            <p class="depth0">This section incorporates the statutory requirements for  establishing and conducting an equal opportunity recruitment program  consistent with law within the Federal civil service. The policy in 5  U.S.C. 7201(b) reads as follows: ``It is the policy of the United States  to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without  discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national  origin. The President shall use his existing authority to carry out this  policy.'' 5 U.S.C. 7201(c) requires under regulations prescribed by the  Office of Personnel Management:</p><p class="depth0">``(1) That each Executive agency conduct a continuing program for  the recruitment of members of minorities for positions in the agency to  carry out the [anti-discrimination] policy set forth in subsection (b)  in a manner designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities in  the various categories of civil service employment within the Federal  service, with special efforts directed at recruiting in minority  communities, in educational institutions, and from other sources from  which minorities can be recruited; and</p><p class="depth0">``(2) That the Office conduct a continuing program of--</p><p class="depth0">``(A) Assistance to agencies in carrying out programs under  paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p><p class="depth0">``(B) Evaluation and oversight of such recruitment programs to  determine their effectiveness in eliminating such minority  underrepresentation.''   This section and all implementing guidance shall be interpreted  consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,  42 U.S.C. 2000c et seq.  [44 FR 22031, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 193, Jan. 4, 1983]</p>
