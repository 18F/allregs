The top hole must be closed, and the bottom hole  may be closed, with not less than three-fourths inch and not more than  1\1/2\-inch solid pipe plugs having NPT threads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the tank is divided into compartments by constructing each  compartment as a separate tank, these tanks shall be joined together by  a cylinder made of plate, having a thickness not less than that required  for the tank shell and applied to the outside surface of tank head  flanges. The cylinder shall fit the straight flange portion of the  compartment tank head tightly. The cylinder shall contact the head  flange for a distance of at least two times the plate thickness, or a  minimum of 1 inch, whichever is greater. The cylinder shall be joined to  the head flange by a full fillet weld. Distance from head seam to  cylinder shall not be less than 1\1/2\ inches or three times the plate  thickness, whichever is greater. Voids created by the space between  heads of tanks joined together to form a compartment tank shall be  provided with a tapped drain hole at their lowest point and a tapped  hole at top of tank. The top hole shall be closed and the bottom hole  may be closed with solid pipe plugs not less than \3/4\ inch nor more  than 1\1/2\ inches having NPT threads.  [29 FR 18995, Dec. 29, 1964.
