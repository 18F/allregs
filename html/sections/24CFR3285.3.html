An alteration, as defined in Sec. 3282.7 of this chapter, must  not affect the ability of the basic manufactured home to comply with the  MHCSS, and the alteration must not impose additional loads to the  manufactured home or its foundation, unless the alteration is included  in the manufacturer's DAPIA-approved designs and installation  instructions, or is designed by a registered professional engineer or  architect consistent with the manufacturer's design and that conforms to  the requirements of the MHCSS.</p>
