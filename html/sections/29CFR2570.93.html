                            <p class="depth0">For 502(c)(5) civil penalty proceedings, this section shall apply in  lieu of 29 CFR 18.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term party wherever used in this subpart shall include any  natural person, corporation, employee benefit plan, association, firm,  partnership, trustee, receiver, agency, public or private organization,  or government agency. A party against whom a civil penalty is sought  shall be designated as ``respondent.'' The Department shall be  designated as the ``complainant.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other persons or organizations shall be permitted to participate  as parties only if the administrative law judge finds that the final  decision could directly and adversely affect them or the class they  represent, that they may contribute materially to the disposition of the  proceedings and their interest is not adequately represented by existing  parties, and that in the discretion of the administrative law judge the  participation of such persons or organizations would be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A person or organization not named as a respondent wishing to  participate as a party under this section shall submit a petition to the  administrative law judge within fifteen (15) days after the person or  organization has knowledge of or should have known about the proceeding.  The petition shall be filed with the administrative law judge and served  on each person or organization who has been made a party at the time of  filing. Such petition shall concisely state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Petitioner's interest in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How his or her participation as a party will contribute  materially to the disposition of the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Who will appear for petitioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The issues on which petitioner wishes to participate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether petitioner intends to present witnesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Objections to the petition may be filed by a party within  fifteen (15) days of the filing of the petition. If objections to the  petition are filed, the administrative law judge shall then determine  whether petitioners have the requisite interest to be a party in the  proceedings, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, and shall  permit or deny participation accordingly. Where petitions to participate  as parties are made by individuals or groups with common interests, the  administrative law judge may request all such petitioners to designate a  single representative, or he or she may recognize one or more of such  petitioners. The administrative law judge shall give each such  petitioner as well as the parties,   written notice of the decision on his or her petition. For each petition  granted, the administrative law judge shall provide a brief statement of  the basis of the decision. If the petition is denied, he or she shall  briefly state the grounds for denial and shall then treat the petition  as a request for participation as amicus curiae.</p>
