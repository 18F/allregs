                            <p class="depth0">All buildings or rooms on wine premises in which wine operations or  other operations as are authorized in this part are conducted will be  located, constructed, and equipped in a manner suitable for the intended  purpose and to afford adequate protection to the revenue. Each building  or room will be constructed of substantial materials and separated from  adjacent or contiguous buildings, rooms, or designated areas in a manner  satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer. Where spirits are to be  received and stored in packages, a storage room equipped for locking  will be provided. The proprietor shall make provisions to assure TTB  officers have ready ingress to and egress from any building or room on  wine premises, and shall furnish at the request of the appropriate TTB  officer evidence that the means of ingress and egress by TTB officers  are assured. Where the appropriate TTB officer finds that any building  or room on wine premises is located, constructed, or equipped as to  afford inadequate protection to the revenue, the proprietor will be  required to make changes in location, construction, or equipment to the  extent necessary to afford adequate protection to the revenue.
