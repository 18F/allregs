Requests for License Exception STA eligibility must be made via the BIS Simplified Network Application Process-Redesign(SNAP-R) system unless BIS authorizes submission via the paper BIS-748-P Multipurpose Application form. For situations in which BIS 748-P submissions may be authorized, see Sec. 748.1(d)(1).

and 6 and Supplement No. 2 to part 748, paragraph (w). In SNAP-R the work type for these applications is ``Export.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timeline for USG review. The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will review License Exception STA eligibility requests in accordance with the timelines set forth in Executive Order 12981 and Sec. 750.4. If the License Exception STA request is approved, the process outlined in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section is followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Review criteria. The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will determine whether the ``end item'' is eligible for this license exception based on an assessment of whether it provides a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies. If the ``end item'' does not provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies, the Departments will determine that License Exception STA is available unless an overarching foreign policy rationale for restricting STA availability can be articulated. Consensus among the Departments is required in order for an ``end item'' to be eligible for License Exception STA. Such determinations are made by the departments' representatives to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), or their designees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disposition of License Exception STA eligibility requests--(i) Approvals. If the request for STA eligibility is approved, the applicant will receive notification from BIS authorizing the use of the additional License Exception STA for the specific end items requested. This will be in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants who receive an approval notification may share it with companies affiliated with them, such as a branch or distributor, and may also take steps to make it public (e.g., on their Web site) if the applicants so wish. In addition, BIS will add a description of the approved end item in the relevant ECCN and in an online table posted on the BIS Web site, which removes the restriction on the use of License Exception STA for the end item identified in the approved request. BIS will publish, as needed, a final rule adding this license exception eligibility to the EAR for that ECCN entry or end item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approvals.
