The notification must  either expressly inform the recipient that the EAR impose limits on  further disclosure or must be in the form of an agreement in which the  recipient agrees to limits on further disclosure. Any such agreement  must impose limits that are equivalent to or more restrictive than all  limits on further disclosure that are imposed by the EAR.

Requests for  License Exception STA eligibility must be made via the BIS Simplified  Network Application Process-Redesign(SNAP-R) system unless BIS  authorizes submission via the paper BIS-748-P Multipurpose Application  form. For situations in which BIS 748-P submissions may be authorized,  see Sec. 748.1(d)(1). For required information specific to License  Exception STA eligibility requests, see Supplement No. 1 to part 748,  Blocks 5   and 6 and Supplement No. 2 to part 748, paragraph (w). In SNAP-R the  work type for these applications is ``Export.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timeline for USG review. The Departments of Commerce, Defense  and State will review License Exception STA eligibility requests in  accordance with the timelines set forth in Executive Order 12981 and  Sec. 750.4. If the License Exception STA request is approved, the  process outlined in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section is followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Review criteria. The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State  will determine whether the ``end item'' is eligible for this license  exception based on an assessment of whether it provides a critical  military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise  available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies. If  the ``end item'' does not provide a critical military or intelligence  advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries  that are not regime partners or close allies, the Departments will  determine that License Exception STA is available unless an overarching  foreign policy rationale for restricting STA availability can be  articulated. Consensus among the Departments is required in order for an  ``end item'' to be eligible for License Exception STA. Such  determinations are made by the departments' representatives to the  Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), or their designees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disposition of License Exception STA eligibility requests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Approvals. If the request for STA eligibility is approved, the applicant  will receive notification from BIS authorizing the use of the additional  License Exception STA for the specific end items requested. This will be  in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants  who receive an approval notification may share it with companies  affiliated with them, such as a branch or distributor, and may also take  steps to make it public (e.g., on their Web site) if the applicants so  wish. In addition, BIS will add a description of the approved end item  in the relevant ECCN and in an online table posted on the BIS Web site,  which removes the restriction on the use of License Exception STA for  the end item identified in the approved request. BIS will publish, as  needed, a final rule adding this license exception eligibility to the  EAR for that ECCN entry or end item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Denials. If the STA eligibility request is not approved, the  applicant will receive written notification from BIS. This will be in  the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants  may re-submit STA eligibility requests at any time.
