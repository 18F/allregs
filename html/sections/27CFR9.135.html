The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Virginia's Eastern Shore.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the ``Virginia's Eastern Shore'' viticultural area are 3 U.S.G.S. Quadrangle (1:250,000 Series) maps.

Where there are marshes indicated on the U.S.G.S. maps, the boundry is the inland side of these marshes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the boundary reaches the southernmost point of the peninsula, on the Eastville, VA., U.S.G.S. map, the boundary turns and proceeds in a northwesterly direction, again following the coastline around Cherrystone Inlet on the Richmond, VA., U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The boundary continues to follow the coastline and the inland side of any marshes indicated on the U.S.G.S. maps in a northeasterly direction, until it reaches the Virginia/Maryland border on the Eastville, VA., U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The boundary then follows the Virginia/Maryland border back to the beginning point at Chincoteague Bay on the Salisbury, MD., U.S.G.S. map.
