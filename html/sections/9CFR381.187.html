                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 472(b) to  coordinate with States that have poultry products inspection programs as  provided in Sec. 381.185 of this subpart to select certain  establishments operating under these programs to participate in a  cooperative program to ship poultry products in interstate commerce. A  cooperative program for this purpose is called a ``cooperative  interstate shipment program.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative  interstate shipment program described in this section must receive  inspection services from designated State personnel that have been  trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel  determine that the poultry products prepared in establishments selected  to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply  with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official  Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce.  The Administrator will assign an FSIS ``selected establishment  coordinator,'' who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that  participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide  Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's  requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided  by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program  under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs.  Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS  has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services  to selected establishments in the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subpart Z, of this part 381 prescribes conditions under which  States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate  shipment program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate  shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the  State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a  manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in  this chapter.
