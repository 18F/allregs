                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. PIA's are generally computed under one of two normal  formulas determined by the employee's eligibility year. In addition,  there is a special PIA formula, based on an employee's years of  coverage, that is used when it produces a PIA that is higher than the  PIA computed under the appropriate PIA formula. The two most common PIA  formulas are the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA formula and the  Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula. The special PIA formula is called  the Special Minimum PIA formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA formula. When the  employee's eligibility year is after 1978, the Tier I PIA, Overall  Minimum PIA, Survivor   Tier I PIA, Employee's Retirement Insurance Benefit PIA and Residual  Lump-Sum PIA are computed under the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA  formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula. The Average Monthly  Earnings PIA formula is used to compute a PIA for one of two reasons:  either the employee's eligibility year is before 1979 or the type of PIA  requires that it always be computed under the Average Monthly Earnings  PIA formula.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula based on the  employee's eligibility year. The Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula is  used in computing the Tier I PIA, the Overall Minimum PIA, the Employee  Fictional Retirement Insurance Benefit PIA and the Residual Lump-Sum PIA  when the employee's eligibility year is before 1979.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Types of PIA's always computed using the Average Monthly  Earnings PIA formula. The following PIA's used by the Board are  determined under the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31,  1974, and are always computed using the Average Monthly Earnings PIA  formula.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Combined Earnings Dual Benefit PIA described in Sec. 225.12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Social Security Earnings Dual Benefit PIA described in Sec.  225.13.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA described in Sec. 225.14.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Combined Earnings PIA described in Sec. 225.23.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Social Security Earnings PIA described in Sec. 225.24.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Railroad Earnings PIA described in Sec. 225.25.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special Minimum PIA formula. The Special Minimum PIA formula is  based on the employee's years of coverage. The Special Minimum PIA  formula usually applies when the employee had consistently low earnings  during his or her working lifetime. The Special Minimum PIA formula is  used when it is higher than the PIA calculated under the applicable  Average Indexed Monthly Earnings formula or the Average Monthly Earnings  formula.</p>
