                                Sec. 552.105  Individuals performing babysitting services in their own homes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is clear from the legislative history that the Act's new  coverage of domestic service employees is limited to those persons who  perform such services in or about the private household of the employer.  Accordingly, if such services are performed away from the employer's  permanent, or temporary household there is no coverage under sections  6(f) and 7(l) of the Act. A typical example would be an individual who  cares for the children of others in her own home. This type of  operation, however, could, depending on the particular facts, qualify as  a preschool or day care center and thus be covered under section  3(s)(1)(B) of the Act in which case the person providing the service  would be required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An individual in a local neighborhood who takes four or five  children into his or her home, which is operated as a day care home, and  who does not have more than one employee or whose   only employees are members of that individual's immediate family is not  covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
