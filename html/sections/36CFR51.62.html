                                Sec. 51.62  What is the process to determine the leasehold surrender  new concession contract?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Leasehold surrender interest concession contracts must contain  provisions under which the Director and the concessioner will seek to  agree in advance of the expiration or other termination of the  concession contract as to what the concessioner's leasehold surrender  interest value will be on a unit-by-unit basis as of the date of  expiration or termination of the concession contract. In the event that  agreement cannot be reached, the provisions of the leasehold surrender  interest concession contract must provide for the Director to make a  final determination of leasehold surrender interest value unless binding  arbitration as to the value is requested by the concessioner. The  arbitration procedures are described in Sec. 51.51. A prior decision as  to the construction cost of capital improvements made by the Director or  by an arbitration panel in accordance with this part are final and not  subject to further arbitration.
