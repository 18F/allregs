States operating  OSHA-approved State Plans must have occupational injury and illness  recording and reporting requirements that are substantially identical to  the requirements in this part (see 29 CFR 1902.3(k), 29 CFR 1952.4 and  29 CFR 1956.10(i)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State-Plan States must have the same  requirements as Federal OSHA for determining which injuries and  illnesses are recordable and how they are recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For other part 1904 provisions (for example, industry  exemptions, reporting of fatalities and hospitalizations, record  retention, or employee involvement), State-Plan State requirements may  be more stringent than or supplemental to the Federal requirements, but  because of the unique nature of the national recordkeeping program,  States must consult with and obtain approval of any such requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Although State and local government employees are not covered  Federally, all State-Plan States must provide coverage, and must develop  injury and illness statistics, for these workers. State Plan recording  and reporting requirements for State and local government entities may  differ from those for the private sector but must meet the requirements  of paragraphs 1904.37(b)(1) and (b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A State-Plan State may not issue a variance to a private sector  employer and must recognize all variances issued by Federal OSHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State Plan State may only grant an injury and illness  recording and reporting variance to a State or local government employer  within the State after obtaining approval to grant the variance from  Federal OSHA.</p>
