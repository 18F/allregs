                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the CPSIA  provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended  primarily for children 12 years of age or younger may not contain more  than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or  intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger cannot  contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit will be  further reduced to 100 ppm, unless the Commission determines that this  lower limit is not technologically feasible. Paint, coatings or  electroplating may not be considered a barrier that would make the lead  content of a product inaccessible to a child or prevent the absorption  of any lead in the human body through normal and reasonably foreseeable  use and abuse of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion of certain materials or products and inaccessible  component parts. The CPSIA provides the following functional purpose  exception from the lead limits stated in section 101(a) of the CPSIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Functional purpose exception--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The Commission, on  its own initiative or upon petition by an interested party, shall grant  an exception to the limit under paragraph (a) of this section for a  specific product, class of product, material, or component part if the  Commission, after notice and a hearing, determines that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The product, class of product, material, or component part  requires the inclusion of lead because it is not practicable or not  technologically feasible to manufacture such product, class of product,  material, or component part, as the case may be, in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section by removing the excessive lead or by  making the lead inaccessible;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The product, class of product, material, or component part is  not likely to be placed in the mouth or ingested, taking into account  normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, class  of product, material, or component part by a child; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An exception for the product, class of product, material, or  component part will have no measurable adverse effect on public health  or safety, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and  abuse.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Measurement. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this  section, there is no measurable adverse effect on public health or  safety if the exception described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section  will result in no measurable increase in blood lead levels of a child.  The Commission may adopt an alternative method of measurement other than  blood lead levels if it determines, after notice and a hearing, that  such alternative method is a better scientific method for measuring  adverse effect on public health and safety.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Procedures for granting exception--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Burden of proof. A  party seeking an exception under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has  the burden of demonstrating that it meets the requirements of such  paragraph.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Grounds for decision. In the case where a party has petitioned  for an exception, in determining whether to grant the exception, the  Commission may base its decision solely on the materials presented by  the party seeking the exception and any materials received through  notice and a hearing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Admissible evidence. In demonstrating that it meets the  requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a party seeking an  exception under such paragraph may rely on any nonproprietary  information submitted by any other party seeking such an exception and  such information shall be considered part of the record presented by the  party that relies on that information.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Scope of exception. If an exception is sought for an entire  product, the burden is on the petitioning party to demonstrate that the  criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are met with respect to  every accessible component or accessible material of the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation on exception. If the Commission grants an exception  for a product, class of product, material, or component part under  paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the Commission may, as necessary to  protect public health or safety:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish a lead limit that such product, class of product,  material, or component part may not exceed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Place a manufacturing expiration date on such exception or  establish a schedule after which the manufacturer of such product, class  of product, material, or component part shall be in full compliance with  the limit established under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section or  the limit set forth under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Application of exception. An exception under paragraph (b)(1)(i)  of this section for a product, class of product, material, or component  part shall apply regardless of the date of manufacture unless the  Commission expressly provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Previously submitted petitions. A party seeking an exception  under this paragraph may rely on materials previously submitted in  connection with a petition for exclusion under this section. In such  cases, petitioners must notify the Commission of their intent to rely on  materials previously submitted. Such reliance does not affect  petitioners' obligation to demonstrate that they meet all requirements  of this   paragraph as required by paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]  [74 FR 10480, Mar. 11, 2009, as amended at 78 FR 41298, July 10, 2013]</p>
