Monies disbursed under this Program must be used to fund new projects, or expand or enhance existing projects. The VAWA funds cannot be used to supplant or replace existing funds already allocated to funding programs. Grant funds may not be used to replace State or local funds (or, where applicable, funds provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) that would, in the absence of Federal aid, be available or forthcoming for programs to combat violence against women. This requirement applies only to State and local public agencies. Section 2002(c)(4).</p>
