                            <p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In most cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur  within the 7-day constructive acceptance period specified in the FAR  Prompt Payment clauses. Government payment of construction progress  payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14-day period allowed by  the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the  contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period  specified in the contract is not reasonable or practical, such change  should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for  acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer  period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or  supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and  acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A  constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is  not authorized.  [70 FR 75413, Dec. 20, 2005]</p>
