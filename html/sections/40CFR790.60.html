                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard provisions. All consent agreements will contain the  following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the chemical(s) to be tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The health effects, environmental effects and/or other  characteristics for which testing will be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The names and addresses of each manufacturer and/or processor  who will sign the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the manufacturer, processor or other  entity who has agreed to act as the principal test sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The technical or commercial grade, level of purity or other  characteristics of the test substances(s) or mixture(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Standards for the development of test data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A requirement that testing will be conducted in accordance with  the EPA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations (40 CFR part 792).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Schedules with reasonable deadlines for submitting interim  progress and/or final reports to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A requirement that the principal sponsor will submit a study  plan to EPA in accordance with Sec. 790.62.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A statement that the results of testing conducted pursuant to  the consent agreement will be announced to the public in accordance with  the procedures specified in section 4(d) of the Act and that the  disclosure of data generated by such testing will be governed by section  14(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A requirement that the manufacturers and/or processors signing  the consent agreement will comply with the notification requirements of  section 12(b)(1) of the Act and part 707 of this chapter if they export  or intend to export the substance or mixture for which the submission of  data is required under the agreement and a statement that any other  person who exports or intends to export such substance or mixture is  subject to the above cited export notification requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A requirement that, in the event EPA promulgates a significant  new use rule applicable to the test chemical under section 5(a)(2), the  consent agreement will have the status of a test rule for purposes of  section 5(b)(1)(A) and manufacturers and/or processors signing the  agreement will comply with the data submission requirements imposed by  that provision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A statement that each manufacturer and/or processor signing the  agreement agrees that violation of its requirements will constitute a  ``prohibited act'' under section 15(1) of the Act and will trigger all  provisions of TSCA applicable to a violation of section 15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> A statement that, in the event one or more provisions of the  agreement are determined to be unenforceable by a court, the remainder  of the agreement would not be presumed to be   valid and EPA will then either initiate a rulemaking proceeding or  publish in the Federal Register the Administrator's reason for not  initiating such a proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> A statement that the Agency may conduct laboratory inspections  and/or study audits of the testing being conducted pursuant to the  consent agreement in accordance with the authority and procedures  contained in section 11 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> A statement that EPA acceptance of a consent agreement  constitutes ``final agency action'' for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Any other requirements that the parties agree are necessary to  achieve the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of standards for the development of data. The standards  for the development of the data included in consent agreements will be  based on the TSCA test guidelines in 40 CFR parts 796, 797, and 798, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test  guidelines, the EPA pesticide assessment guidelines published by The  National Technical Information Service (NTIS), or other suitable test  methodologies. During the negotiation of consent agreements, EPA will  initially propose suitable test guidelines as the required test  standards; manufacturers and processors or other interested parties may  then suggest alternative methodologies or modifications to the Agency's  proposed guidelines. These alternative methodologies or modifications  will be adopted only where, in the judgment of EPA, they will develop at  least equally reliable and adequate data on the chemical substance or  mixture subject to the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement of rationale for consent agreement. EPA will prepare a  written explanation of the basis for each consent agreement. This  document will summarize the agreement, describe any ITC testing  recommendations for the chemical involved, outline the chemical's use  and exposure characteristics, and explain the objectives of the testing  to be conducted and the rationale for the specific studies selected.  This document will be published in the Federal Register and, for ITC- designated chemicals, will constitute the statement of EPA's reasons for  not initiating rulemaking required by section 4(e)(1)(B) of the Act.
