The notification must include all the information required for an application for approval of construction or reconstruction as required by Sec. 63.5(d). For major sources, the application for approval of construction or reconstruction may be used to fulfill these requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application must be submitted as soon as practicable before the construction or reconstruction is planned to commence (but no sooner than the effective date) if the construction or reconstruction commences after the effective date of this subpart; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application must be submitted as soon as practicable before startup but no later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart if the construction or reconstruction had commenced and initial startup had not occurred before the effective date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As required by Sec. 63.9(d), the owner or operator must provide notification of any special compliance obligations for a new source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As required by Sec. 63.9(e) and (f), the owner or operator must provide notification of the anticipated date for conducting performance tests and visible emission observations. The owner or operator must notify the Administrator of the intent to conduct a performance test at least 60 days before the performance test is scheduled; notification of opacity or visible emission observations for a performance test must be provided at least 30 days before the observations are scheduled to take place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> As required by Sec. 63.9(g), the owner or operator must provide additional notifications for sources with continuous emission monitoring systems or continuous opacity monitoring systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of compliance status report. Each owner or operator of an existing affected source must submit a notification of compliance status report within 60 days after the compliance date established by Sec. 63.1501(a). Each owner or operator of a new affected source must submit a notification of compliance status report within 90 days after conducting the initial performance test required by Sec. 63.1511(b), or within 90 days after the compliance date established by Sec. 63.1501(b) if no initial performance test is required. The notification must be signed by the responsible official who must certify its accuracy. A complete notification of compliance status report must include the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section. The required information may be submitted in an operating permit application, in an amendment to an operating permit application, in a separate submittal, or

in any combination. In a State with an approved operating permit program where delegation of authority under section 112(l) of the CAA has not been requested or approved, the owner or operator must provide duplicate notification to the applicable Regional Administrator. If an owner or operator submits the information specified in this section at different times or in different submittals, later submittals may refer to earlier submittals instead of duplicating and resubmitting the information previously submitted. A complete notification of compliance status report must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All information required in Sec. 63.9(h). The owner or operator must provide a complete performance test report for each affected source and emission unit for which a performance test is required.
