The owner, master, or person in charge shall keep records of such tests and inspections showing the dates when performed, the number and/or other identification of each unit tested and inspected, and the name(s) of the person(s) and/or company conducting the tests and inspections. Such records shall be made available to the inspector upon request and shall be kept for the period of validity of the vessel's current certificate of inspection. Where practicable these records should be kept in or with the vessel's log book.
