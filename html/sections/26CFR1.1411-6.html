                                Sec. 1.1411-6  Income on investment of working capital subject to tax.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. For purposes of section 1411, any item of gross  income from the investment of working capital will be treated as not  derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, and any net gain  that is attributable to the investment of working capital will be  treated as not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. In  determining whether any item is gross income from or net gain  attributable to an investment of working capital, principles similar to  those described in Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(ii) apply. See Sec. 1.1411-4(f)  for rules regarding properly allocable deductions with respect to an  investment of working capital and Sec. 1.1411-7 for rules relating to  the adjustment to net gain on the disposition of interests in a  partnership or S corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this section. Assume for purposes of the example that the taxpayer uses  a calendar taxable year, the taxpayer is a United States citizen, and  Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411  is in effect:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A, an unmarried individual, operates a restaurant,  which is a section 162   trade or business but is not a trade or business described in  Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1) with respect to A. A owns and conducts the  restaurant business through S, an S corporation wholly-owned by A. S is  able to pay all of the restaurant's current obligations with cash flow  generated by the restaurant. S utilizes an interest-bearing checking  account at a local bank to make daily deposits of cash receipts  generated by the restaurant, and also to pay the recurring ordinary and  necessary business expenses of the restaurant. The average daily balance  of the checking account is approximately $2,500, but at any given time  the balance may be significantly more or less than this amount depending  on the short-term cash flow needs of the business. In addition, S has  set aside $20,000 for the potential future needs of the business in case  the daily cash flow into and from the checking account becomes  insufficient to pay the restaurant's recurring business expenses. S does  not currently need to spend or use the $20,000 capital to conduct the  restaurant business, and S deposits and maintains the $20,000 in an  interest-bearing savings account at a local bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> and, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section,  the interest generated by this working capital will not be treated as  derived in the ordinary course of S's restaurant business. Accordingly,  the interest income derived by S from its checking and savings accounts  and allocated to A under section 1366 constitutes gross income from  interest under Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply  this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, in  accordance with Sec. 1.1411-1(f).  [T.D. 9644, 78 FR 72424, Dec. 2, 2013]</p>
