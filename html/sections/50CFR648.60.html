(1) For the 2015 fishing year, each occasional scallop vessel shall have a total of 4,250 lb (1,928 kg) of scallop that may be harvested from the Mid-Atlantic Access Area, as defined in Sec. 648.59(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the 2016 fishing year, each occasional scallop vessel shall have a total of 1,420 lb (644 kg) of scallop that may be harvested from the Mid-Atlantic Access Area, as defined in Sec. 648.59(a), starting on April 1, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One-for-one area access allocation exchanges. The owner of a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit may exchange unharvested scallop pounds allocated into one access area for another vessel's unharvested scallop pounds allocated into another Sea Scallop Access Area. These exchanges may only be made for the amount of the current trip possession limit, as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For example, if the access area trip possession limit for full-time vessels is 17,000 lb (7,711 kg), a full-time vessel may exchange no less than 17,000 lb (7,711 kg), from one access area for no more or less than 17,000 lb (7,711 kg) allocated to another vessel for another access area. In addition, these exchanges may be made only between vessels with the same permit category: A full-time vessel may not exchange allocations with a part-time vessel, and vice versa. Vessel owners must request these exchanges by submitting a completed Access Area Allocation Exchange Form at least 15 days before the date on which the applicant desires the exchange to be effective. Exchange forms are available from the Regional Administrator upon request. Each vessel owner involved in an exchange is required to submit a completed Access Area Allocation Form. The Regional Administrator shall review the records for each vessel to confirm that each vessel has enough unharvested allocation remaining in a given access area to exchange. The exchange is not effective until the vessel owner(s) receive a confirmation in writing from the Regional Administrator that the allocation exchange has been made effective. A vessel owner may exchange equal allocations up to the current possession limit between two or more vessels under his/her ownership. A vessel owner holding a Confirmation of Permit History is not eligible to exchange allocations between another vessel and the vessel for which a Confirmation of Permit History has been issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Area fished. While on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip, a vessel may not fish for, possess, or land scallops in or from areas outside the Sea Scallop Access Area in which the vessel operator has declared the vessel will fish during that trip, and may not enter or exit the specific declared Sea Scallop Access Area more than once per trip. A vessel on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip may not enter or be in another Sea Scallop Access Area on the same trip except such vessel may transit another Sea Scallop Access Area provided its gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)-(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Possession and landing limits--(i) Scallop possession limits.

Dredge or trawl gear used by a vessel fishing on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip must be in accordance with the restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels fishing in the Closed Area I, Closed Area II, and Nantucket Lightship Closed Area Sea Scallop Access Areas described in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d) are prohibited from fishing with trawl gear as specified in Sec. 648.51(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transiting. While outside a Sea Scallop Access Area on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip, the vessel must have all fishing gear stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2, unless there is a compelling safety reason to be transiting the area without gear stowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Off-loading restrictions. The vessel may not offload its catch from a Sea Scallop Access Area trip at more than one location per trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Reporting. The owner or operator must submit scallop catch reports through the VMS, as specified in Sec. 648.10(f)(4)(i), and limited access scallop access area pre-landing notification forms, as specified in Sec. 648.10(f)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Access area scallop allocation carryover. Unless otherwise specified in Sec. 648.59, a limited access scallop vessel operator may fish any unharvested Scallop Access Area allocation from a given fishing year within the first 60 days of the subsequent fishing year if the Access Area is open. For example, if a full-time vessel has 7,000 lb (3,175 kg) remaining in the Mid-Atlantic Access Area at the end of fishing year 2015, that vessel may harvest 7,000 lb (3,175 kg) from its 2016 fishing year scallop access area allocation during the first 60 days that the Mid-Atlantic Access Area is open in fishing year 2016 (March 1, 2016, through April 29, 2017). Unless otherwise specified in Sec. 648.59, if an Access Area is not open in the subsequent fishing year, then the unharvested scallop allocation would expire at the end of the fishing year that the scallops were allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Increase in possession limit to defray costs of observers--The Regional Administrator may increase the sea scallop possession limit specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section to defray costs of at-sea observers deployed on area access trips subject to the limits specified Sec. 648.53(g). An owner of a scallop vessel shall be notified of the increase in the possession limit through a permit holder letter issued by the Regional Administrator. If the observer set-aside is fully utilized prior to the end of the fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall notify owners of scallop vessels that, effective on a specified date, the increase in the possession limit is no longer available to

offset the cost of observers. Unless otherwise notified by the Regional Administrator, vessel owners shall be responsible for paying the cost of the observer, regardless of whether the vessel lands or sells sea scallops on that trip, and regardless of the availability of set-aside for an increased possession limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside Harvest in Access Areas--(1) Access Areas available for harvest of research set-aside (RSA). Unless otherwise specified, RSA may be harvested in any access area that is open in a given fishing year, as specified through a framework adjustment and pursuant to Sec. 648.56. The amount of scallops that can be harvested in each access area by vessels participating in approved RSA projects shall be determined through the RSA application review and approval process. The access areas open for RSA harvest for fishing years 2015 and 2016 are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Access Areas available for harvest of research set-aside (RSA).
