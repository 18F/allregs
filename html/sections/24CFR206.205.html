                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The mortgagor shall pay all property charges consisting  of taxes, ground rents, flood and hazard insurance premiums, and special  assessments in a timely manner and shall provide evidence of payment to  the mortgagee as required in the mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Election. A mortgagor may elect to require the mortgagee to pay  property charges by withholding funds from monthly payments due to the  mortgagor or by charging such funds to a line of credit. The mortgagor  may make or rescind such an election at any time. If the sum of the  mortgage balance and any unused set asides for repairs and servicing  charges has reached the principal limit or the mortgage funds are  otherwise insufficient to pay the property charges, the mortgagor shall  pay such items as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, even though  the mortgagor elected payment to be made by the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mortgagor's failure to make payments. If the mortgagor fails to  pay the property charges in a timely manner, and has not elected to have  the mortgagee make the payments, the mortgagee may make the payment for  the mortgagor and charge the mortgagor's account. If a pattern of missed  payments occurs, the mortgagee may establish procedures to pay the  property charges from the mortgagor's funds as if the mortgagor elected  to have the mortgagee pay the property charges under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of mortgage to the Secretary. If the insured first  mortgage is assigned to the Secretary under Sec. 206.107(a)(1) or  Sec. 206.121(a), or if payments are made through the second mortgage  under Sec. 206.121(c), the Secretary is not required to assume the  mortgagee's responsibility under paragraph (b) of this section, despite  the election by the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mortgagee's responsibilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funds withheld from payments  due to the mortgagor for property charges under paragraph (b) of this  section shall not be paid into an escrow account. When property charges  are actually paid, the mortgagee may add the amount paid to the mortgage  balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is the mortgagee's responsibility to make disbursements for  property charges before bills become delinquent. Mortgagees must  establish controls to ensure that the information needed to pay such  bills is obtained on a timely basis. Penalties for late payments for  property charges must not be charged to the mortgagor unless it can be  shown that the penalty was the direct result of the mortgagor's error or  omission. Early payment of a bill to take advantage of a discount should  be made whenever it is to the mortgagor's benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not later than the end of the second loan year the mortgagee  shall establish a system for the periodic analysis of the amounts  withheld from monthly payments. The analysis shall be performed at least  once a year thereafter. The amount shall be adjusted, after analysis, to  provide sufficient available funds to make anticipated disbursements  during the ensuing year. The mortgagor shall be given at least ten days  notice of adjustment in the amount of withholding and an adequate  explanation of the reasons for any change. When the amount withheld is  analyzed in accordance with this paragraph, any surplus shall be paid to  the mortgagor and added to the mortgage balance. Any shortage shall be  corrected through increasing the monthly withholding as provided in  paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If amounts withheld are insufficient  to pay a property charge before it is delinquent, and the mortgagor  could request a payment equal to the shortage under Sec. 206.26(c), then  the mortgagee shall pay the full property charge and treat payment of  the shortage as a payment requested by the mortgagor under  Sec. 206.26(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The mortgagee's estimate of withholding amount shall be based on  the best information available as to probable payments which will be  required to be made for property charges in the   coming year. If actual disbursements during the preceding year are used  as the basis, the resulting estimate may deviate from those  disbursements by as much as ten percent. The mortgagee may not require  withholding in excess of the current estimated total annual requirement,  unless expressly requested by the mortgagor. Each monthly withholding  for property charges shall equal one-twelfth of the annual amounts as  reasonably estimated by the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Set aside for first year property charges. If the mortgagor  elects to require the mortgagee to pay property charges and to receive  payments under the term or tenure payment option, then the mortgagee  shall set aside at closing a portion of the principal limit that will be  sufficient to pay such items for the period beginning in the last date  on which each such charge would have been paid under the normal lending  practices of the mortgagee and local custom (if each such date  constitutes prudent lending practice), and ending in the due date of the  first monthly payment to the mortgagor.
