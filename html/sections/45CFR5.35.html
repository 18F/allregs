If we fail to meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your request or your appeal. We will try diligently to comply with the time limits, but if it appears that processing your request may take longer than we would wish, we will acknowledge your request and tell you its status. Since requests may be misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or write to confirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you have not heard from us in a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time allowed. (1) We will decide whether to release records within 10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate FOI office, as

identified in Sec. 5.31 of this part. When we decide to release records, we will actually provide the records, or let you inspect them, as soon as possible after that decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will decide whether to release records within 10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate FOI office, as
