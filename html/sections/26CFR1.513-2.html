                                Sec. 1.513-2  Definition of unrelated trade or business applicable to
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As used in section 512(a), the term unrelated  business taxable income includes only income from an unrelated trade or  business regularly carried on, and the term trade or business has the  same meaning as it has in section 162.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em> (governmental colleges, etc.) to the exercise or  performance of any purpose or function described in section 501(c)(3).  Whether or not an organization is subject to the tax imposed by section  511 shall be determined by the application of these tests to the  particular circumstances involved in each individual case. For certain  exceptions from the term unrelated trade or business, see paragraph (b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A trade or business is regularly carried on when the activity is  conducted with sufficient consistency to indicate a continuing purpose  of the organization to derive some of its income from such activity. An  activity may be regularly carried on even though its performance is  infrequent or seasonal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ordinarily, a trade or business is substantially related to the  activities for which an organization is granted exemption if the  principal purpose of such trade or business is to further (other than  through the production of income) the purpose for which the organization  is granted exemption. In the usual case the nature and size of the trade  or business must be compared with the nature and extent of the  activities for which the organization is granted exemption in order to  determine whether the principal purpose of such trade or business is to  further (other than through the production of income) the purpose for  which the organization is granted exemption. For example, the operation  of a wheat farm is substantially related to the exempt activity of an  agricultural college if the wheat farm isoperated as a part of the  educational program of the college, and is not operated on a scale  disproportionately large when compared with the educational program of  the college. Similarly, a university radio station or press is  considered a related trade or business if operated primarily as an  integral part of the educational program of the university, but is  considered an unrelated trade or business if operated in substantially  the same manner as a commercial radio station   or publishing house. A trade or business not otherwise related does not  become substantially related to an organization's exempt purpose merely  because incidental use is made of the trade or business in order to  further the exempt purpose. For example, the manufacture and sale of a  product by an exempt college would not become substantially related  merely because students as part of their educational program perform  clerical or bookkeeping functions in the business. In some cases, the  business may be substantially related because it is a necessary part of  the exempt activity. For example, in the case of an organization  described in section 501(c)(3) and engaged in the rehabilitation of  handicapped persons, the business of selling articles made by such  persons as a part of their rehabilitation training would not be  considered an unrelated business since such business is a necessary part  of the rehabilitation program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an organization receives a payment pursuant to a contract or  agreement under which such organization is to perform research which  constitutes an unrelated trade or business, the entire amount of such  payment is income from an unrelated trade or business. See, however,  section 512(b), (7), (8), and (9), relating to the exclusion from  unrelated business taxable income of income derived from research for  the United States, or any State, and of income derived from research  performed for any person by a college, university, hospital, or  organization operated primarily for the purpose of carrying on  fundamental research the results of which are freely available to the  general public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. Section 513(a) specifically states that the term  unrelated trade or business does not include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any trade or business in which substantially all the work in  carrying on such trade or business is performed for the organization  without compensation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em>, primarily for the convenience of its members,  students, patients, officers, or employees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any trade or business which consists of selling merchandise,  substantially all of which has been received by the organization as  gifts or contributions   An example of the operation of the first of the exceptions mentioned  above would be an exempt orphanage operating a retail store and selling  to the general public, where substantially all the work in carrying on  such business is performed for the organization by volunteers without  compensation. An example of the second exception would be a laundry  operated by a college for the purpose of laundering dormitory linens and  the clothing of students. The third exception applies to so-called  thrift shops operated by a tax-exempt organization where those desiring  to benefit such organization contribute old clothes, books, furniture,  etc., to be sold to the general public with the proceeds going to the  exempt organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 542).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of  Sec. 1.513-1, this section is applicable with respect to taxable years  beginning before December 13, 1967.  (Sec. 513 as amended by sec. 4, Act of July 14, 1960 (P.L. 86-667, 74  Stat. 536); secs. 121 (b)(4) and (c), Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat.  536, 542))  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6525, 26 FR  190, Jan. 11, 1961; T.D. 6939, 32 FR 17657, Dec. 12, 1967; T.D. 7392, 40  FR 58643, Dec. 18, 1975; 40 FR 60053, Dec. 31, 1975]</p>
