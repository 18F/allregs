                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license is required to export and reexport crime control and detection equipment, related technology and software as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and related technology and software identified in the appropriate ECCNs on the CCL under CC Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section. A license is required to countries listed in CC Column 1 (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items affected by this requirement are identified on the CCL under the following ECCNs: 0A978, 0A979, 0A984, 0A987, 0E984, 1A984, 1A985, 3A980, 3A981, 3D980, 3E980, 4A003 (for fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for fingerprint computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers only), 4E980, 6A002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), and 9A980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shotguns with a barrel length greater than or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section regardless of end-user to countries listed in CC Column 2 (Supplement No. 1 part 738 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shotguns with barrel length greater than or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section only if for sale or resale to police or law enforcement entities in countries listed in CC Column 3 (Supplement No. 1 part 738 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certain crime control items require a license to all destinations, except Canada. These items are identified under ECCNs 0A982, 0A985, and 0E982. Controls for these items appear in each ECCN; a column specific to these controls does not appear in the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Items designed for the execution of human beings as identified in ECCN 0A981 require a license to all destinations including Canada.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> See Sec. 742.11 of the EAR for further information on items controlled under

ECCN 0A983, which require a license to all destinations, including Canada.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing policy. Applications for items controlled under this section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis unless there is civil disorder in the country or region or unless there is evidence that the government of the importing country may have violated internationally recognized human rights. The judicious use of export controls is intended to deter the development of a consistent pattern of human rights abuses, distance the United States from such abuses and avoid contributing to civil disorder in a country or region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity date: August 22, 2000. Contract sanctity applies only to items controlled under ECCNs 0A982, 0A985 and 0E982 destined for countries not listed in CC Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> U.S. controls. In maintaining its controls on crime control and detection items, the United States considers international norms regarding human rights and the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from controls imposed by other countries.
