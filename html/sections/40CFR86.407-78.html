                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. Every new motorcycle manufactured for sale,  sold, offered for sale, introduced or delivered for introduction into  commerce, or imported into the United States which is subject to any of  the standards prescribed in this subpart is required to be covered by a  certificate of conformity issued pursuant to this subpart, except as  specified in paragraph (b) of this section, or otherwise exempted from  this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interim personal use exemption. An individual may manufacture  one motorcycle for personal use without a certificate of conformity,  subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The motorcycle may not be manufactured from a certified  motorcycle. The motorcycle may not be manufactured from a partially  complete motorcycle that is equivalent to a certified motorcycle, unless  the emission controls are included in the final product. The motorcycle  must be manufactured primarily from unassembled components, but may  incorporate some preassembled components. For example, fully  preassembled transmissions may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The motorcycle may not be sold within five years of the date of  final assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No individual may manufacture more than one motorcycle during  his or her lifetime under this exemption. This restriction applies with  respect to the person who purchases the components and/or uses the  motorcycle, rather than to the person(s) who actually assemble(s) the  motorcycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This exemption may not be used to circumvent the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section or the requirements of the Clean Air Act.  For example, this exemption would not cover a case in which an entity  purchases a kit, assembles the kit, and then sells it to another party;  this would be considered to be the sale of the complete motorcycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. Unless  a certificate of conformity has been received for such motorcycles, they  may not be operated on the public streets or highways except for that  operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No request is necessary for display motorcycles that will not be  sold or leased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following requirements apply for exempting display  motorcycles that will be sold or leased:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers planning to sell motorcycles for display must  notify EPA of their intent to do so before they sell any exempted  motorcycles. They must also maintain sales records of exempted  motorcycles for at least three years and make them available to EPA upon  request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No manufacturer may sell or lease more than 24 exempted display  motorcycles in any single calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Anyone selling or leasing a motorcycle exempt under this  paragraph (c) must ensure that the buyer or lessee agrees to comply with  the display exemption terms in the regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each motorcycle exempt under this paragraph (c) must include a  label that identifies the manufacturer and includes the following  statement: THIS MOTORCYCLE IS EXEMPT FROM EPA EMISSION REQUIREMENTS. ITS  USE ON PUBLIC ROADS IS LIMITED PURSUANT TO 40 CFR 86.407-78(c). EPA may  allow manufacturers to locate the label in a location where it is  obscured or hidden by a readily removable component. For example, EPA  may allow the label to be located under the seat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As described in 40 CFR part 1051, motorcycles that are not  considered to be motor vehicles according to 40 CFR 85.1703(a) may be  exempt under this paragraph (c) from the standards and requirements of  40 CFR part 1051. Such motorcycles shall be combined with the  manufacturer's highway motorcycles with respect to the sales restriction  described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> This exemption may not be used to circumvent the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section or the requirements of the Clean Air Act.
