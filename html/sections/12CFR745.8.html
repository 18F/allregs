                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Separate insurance coverage. Qualifying joint accounts, whether owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, as tenants in common, or by husband and wife as community property, shall be insured separately from accounts individually owned by any of the co-owners. The interest of a co-owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the total for that co-owner shall be insured up to the SMSIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of insurance coverage. The interests of each co-owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the total shall be insured up to the SMSIA. (Example: ``A&B;'' have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; ``A&C;'' have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and ``A&B;&C;'' have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000 ($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of $50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying joint accounts. A joint account is a qualifying joint account if each of the co-owners has personally signed a membership or account signature card and has a right of withdrawal on the same basis as the other co-owners. The signature requirement does not apply to share certificates, or to any accounts maintained by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or conservator on behalf of two or more persons if the records of the credit union properly reflect that the account is so maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure to qualify. A joint account that does not meet the requirements for a qualifying joint account shall be treated as owned by the named persons as individuals and the actual ownership interest of each such person in such account shall be added to any other accounts individually owned by such person and insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate. An account will not fail to qualify as a joint account if a joint owner is a minor and applicable state law limits or restricts a minor's withdrawal rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Nonmember joint owners. A nonmember may become a joint owner with a member on a joint account with right of survivorship. The nonmember's interest in such accounts will be insured in the same manner as the member joint-owner's interest.

Sec. 745.9-1  Trust accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of this section, ``trust'' refers to an irrevocable trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All trust interests (as defined in Sec. 745.2(d)(4)), for the same beneficiary, deposited in an account and established pursuant to valid trust agreements created by the same settlor (grantor) shall be added together and insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate, separately from other accounts of the trustee of such trust funds or the settlor or beneficiary of such trust arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> This section applies to trust interests created in Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, formerly Education IRAs, established in connection with

section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 530).

Sec. 745.9-2  Retirement and other employee benefit plan accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pass-through share insurance. Any shares of an employee benefit plan in an insured credit union shall be insured on a ``pass-through'' basis, in the amount of up to the SMSIA for the non-contingent interest of each plan participant, in accordance with Sec. 745.2 of this part. An insured credit union that is not ``well capitalized'' or ``adequately capitalized,'' as those terms are defined in 12 U.S.C. 1790d(c), may not accept employee benefit plan deposits. The terms ``employee benefit plan'' and ``pass-through share insurance'' are given the same meaning in this section as in 12 U.S.C. 1787(k)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of contingent interests. In the event that participants' interests in an employee benefit plan are not capable of evaluation in accordance with the provisions of this section, or an account established for any such plan includes amounts for future participants in the plan, payment by the NCUA with respect to all such interests shall not exceed the SMSIA in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Certain retirement accounts. Shares in an insured credit union made in connection with the following types of retirement plans shall be aggregated and insured in the amount of up to $250,000 (which amount shall be subject to inflation adjustments as provided under section 11(a)(1)(F) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except that $250,000 shall be substituted for $100,000 wherever such term appears in such section) per account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain retirement accounts.

For insurance purposes, IRA and Roth IRA accounts will be combined together and insured in the aggregate up to $250,000 (which amount shall be subject to inflation adjustments as provided under section 11(a)(1)(F) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except that $250,000 shall be substituted for $100,000 wherever such term appears in such section). A Keogh account will be separately insured from an IRA account, Roth IRA account or, where applicable, aggregated IRA and Roth IRA accounts.
