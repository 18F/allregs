                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6)</em>, (b)(5))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposed condominiums or existing condominiums with declarant in  control or marketing units--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Low rise and high rise condominiums. Low  rise and high rise condominiums shall comply with local building codes.  Only the alterations, improvements, or repairs to low rise and high rise  buildings proposed to be converted to the condominium form of ownership  must comply with current local building codes, unless local authorities  require total code compliance on the entire structure when a building is  being converted to the condominium form of ownership. In those areas  where local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with  Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be  required from a registered professional architect and/or registered  engineer certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of  the national building codes which is typical of similar construction  methods and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions  of the condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or  repaired must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Horizontal condominiums. Department of Veterans Affairs policies  and procedures applicable to single-family residential construction  shall also apply to horizontal condominiums. Proposed or existing  (declarant in control or marketing units) horizontal condominium  conversions shall comply with current local building codes for  alterations and improvements or repairs made to convert the building to  the condominium form of ownership unless local authorities require total  code compliance on the entire structure when a building is being  converted to the condominium form of ownership. In those areas where  local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with  Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be  required from a professional architect and/or registered engineer  certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of the  national building codes which is typical of similar construction methods  and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions of the  condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or repaired  must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unit completion. All units in the individual project or phase  must be   substantially completed except for customer preference items, such as  interior finishes, appliances or equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Common element completion. All amenities of the condominium (to  include offsite community facilities), that are to be considered in the  unit value, must be bound legally to the condominium regime. All such  amenities as well as the common elements of the project, must be  substantially completed and available for use by the unit owners. In  large multi-phase projects, the declarant should construct common  elements in a manner consistent with the addition of units to support  the entire development. The Secretary, in appropriate cases, may approve  the placement of adequate funds by the declarant in an escrow or  otherwise earmarked account or accept a letter of credit or surety bond  to assure completion of amenities and allow closing of VA-guaranteed (or  insured) loans. Such funds must be adequate to assure completion of the  amenities free and clear of all liens.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1), 3710(a)(6))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information brochure/public offering statement. When units are  being sold by the declarant (not applicable to resales), an information  brochure/public offering statement must be given to veteran buyers prior  to the time a down payment is received and an agreement is signed,  unless State law authorized receipt of the down payment and delivery of  the information brochure followed by a period in which purchasers may  cancel the purchase agreement without penalty for a specified number of  days. Information brochures must be written in simple terms to inform  buyers that the association does not provide owner's contents and  personal liability policies which are the owner's responsibility. In the  event the development is expandable, series, etc., there must be full  disclosure of the impact of the total development plan. In expandable,  series or other projects with more than one phase, the information  brochure must disclose fully later development rights, and the general  plans of the declarant for additional phases. If the declarant makes no  assurance concerning phases which are not required to be built, the  declarant should state that no assurances are given concerning  construction, unit sizes, building types, architectural styles, etc. In  condominium conversions, the information brochure must list the major  structural and mechanical components and the estimated remaining useful  life of the components. A brief explanation must be furnished in the  brochure explaining that certain major structural or mechanical  components may require replacement within a specified time period. If  the declarant has elected to place funds into a condominium reserve fund  for replacement of a major component under the provisions of Sec.  36.4365(b)(7), the amount of the contribution into the reserve fund must  be specified in the information brochure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Evidence of proper phasing. In an expandable or flexible  condominium, evidence of the addition of each phase in accordance with a  previously approved general plan of development must be submitted to the  Secretary prior to the guaranty of the first loan in the added area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Additional condominium conversion requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The  declarant of any condominium project must furnish structural and  mechanical common element component statements on the present condition  of all accessible structural and mechanical components material to the  use and enjoyment of the condominium. These statements must be completed  by a registered professional engineer and/or architect prior to the  guaranty of the first unit loan in the project. Each statement must also  give an estimate of the expected useful life of the roof, elevators,  heating and cooling, plumbing and electrical systems assuming normal  maintenance. A minimum of 10 years estimated remaining useful life is  required on all structural and mechanical components. In the  alternative, the declarant may contribute an amount of funds to the  condominium reserve fund equal to a minimum of \1/10\ (one-tenth) of the  estimated costs of replacement of a major structural or mechanical  component (as determined by an independent registered professional  architect or engineer) for each year of estimated remaining useful life   less than 10 years, e.g. 7 years remaining useful life equals a \3/10\  required declarant contribution to the reserve fund of the component's  estimated replacement cost. The noted statements and remaining useful  life requirement are not applicable to existing resale conversion  projects when the declarant is no longer marketing units and/or in  control of the association. Expandable or series condominium conversions  require engineering and architectural statements on each stage or phase.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In declarant controlled projects, a statement(s) by the local  authority(ies) of the adequacy of offsite utilities servicing the site  (e.g., sanitary or water) is required. If a local authority(ies)  declines to issue such a statement(s), a statement(s) may be obtained  from a registered professional engineer. If local authority(ies)  declines to issue such a statement(s), a statement(s) may be obtained  from a registered professional engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presale requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed construction or existing declarant in control. Bona  fide agreements of sale must have been executed by purchasers other than  the declarant (who are obligated contractually to complete the purchase)  of 70 percent of the total number of units in the project. Lenders shall  certify as to satisfaction of the presale requirement prior to VA  guaranty of the first unit loan. When a declarant can demonstrate that a  lower percentage would be justified, the Secretary, on an individual  case basis, may approve a presale requirement of less than 70 percent.  Reduction of the 70 percent presale requirement will be considered when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Strong initial sales demonstrate a ready market, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The declarant will provide cash assets or acceptable bonds for  payment of full common area assessments to the owners' association until  such assessments are assumed by unit purchasers, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent phases of an overall development are being  undertaken in a proven market area, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Previous experience in similar projects in the same market area  indicates strong market acceptance, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The development is in a market area that has repeatedly  indicated acceptance of such projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiphase--proposed or existing declarant in control. The  requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to each  individual phase of a multiphase development, taking into consideration  that each individual phase must be capable of self-support in the event  that the developer does not complete all planned phases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Warranty. Except in condominium conversion projects, each CRV  (Certificate of Reasonable Value) issued by the Secretary relating to a  proposed or existing not previously occupied dwelling unit in a  condominium project shall be subject to the express condition that the  builder, seller, or the real party in interest in the transaction shall  deliver to the veteran purchasing the dwelling unit with the aid of a  guaranteed or insured loan a warranty against defects for the unit and  common elements. The unit shall be warranted for 1 year from the date of  settlement or the date of occupancy (whichever first occurs). The common  elements shall be warranted for 2 years from the date each of the common  elements is completed and available for use by the unit owners, or 2  years from the date the first unit is conveyed to a unit owner other  than the declarant, whichever is later, in the particular phase of the  condominium containing the common element. For these purposes, defects  shall be those items reasonably requiring the repair, renovation,  restoration, or replacement of any of the components constituting the  unit or common elements. Items of maintenance relating to the unit or  common elements are not covered by the warranty. No certificate of  guaranty or insurance credit shall be issued unless a copy of such  warranty, duly receipted by the purchaser, is submitted with the loan  papers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ownership and operation of offsite facilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title  requirements. Evidence must be presented that the offsite facility owned  by an owners' association with mandatory membership by condominium unit  owners or condominium unit owners' associations has been completed and  conveyed free of encumbrances by the declarant for the   benefit of the unit owners with title insured by an owner's title policy  or other acceptable title evidence. Offsite facilities conveyed to a  nonprofit corporation are the preferred method of offsite facilities  ownership; however, the Secretary will consider other forms of ownership  on an individual case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mandatory membership. The declaration of the condominium (each  condominium in a series development) and the legal documentation of the  corporation or association which owns the offsite facility must provide  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner of a condominium unit is automatically a member of the  offsite facility corporation or association and that upon the sale of  the unit, membership is transferred automatically to the new owner/ purchaser. It is also acceptable if each condominium owners' association  (in lieu of each individual unit owner) is automatically a member of the  offsite facility corporation or association coupled with use rights for  each of the unit owners or residents. If membership in an offsite  owners' association is voluntary, no credit in the CRV valuation may be  given for such offsite amenities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each member of the offsite facility corporation or association  must be entitled to a representative vote at meetings of the offsite  facility corporation or association. If the individual condominium  owners' association is a member of the offsite facility corporation or  association, each condominium owners' association must be entitled to a  representative vote at meetings of the offsite facility corporation or  association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each member must agree by acceptance of the unit deed to pay a  share of the expenses of the offsite facility corporation or association  as assessed by the corporation or association for upkeep, insurance,  reserve fund for replacements, maintenance and operation of the offsite  facility. The share of said expenses shall be determined equitably.  Failure to pay such assessment must result in a lien against the  individual unit in the same manner as unpaid assessments by the  association of owners of the condominium. If each condominium owners'  association is a member of the offsite facility in lieu of individual  unit owners, failure of the condominium owners' association to pay its  equitable assessment to the offsite facility must result in an  enforceable lien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Declarant payment of offsite facility in a series project. Until  the declarant has completed all of the intended condominium phases in a  total condominium development or established each condominium regime by  filing a separate declaration in a series development, the balance of  the total sum of the expenses of the offsite facility not covered by the  assessment against the unit owners should be assessed against and be  payable by the declarant commencing on the first day of the first month  after the first unit is conveyed to a homeowner in the first phase. If  this balance is not paid, it must become a lien against those parcels of  land in the development area which are owned by the declarant. The  collection of such debt and enforcement of such lien may be by  foreclosure or such other remedies afforded the corporation or  association under local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Professional management. Many condominiums are small enough and  their common areas so minimal that professional management is not  necessary. VA does not have a requirement for professional management of  condominiums. The powers given to the owners' association by the  declaration and bylaws are fundamentally for ``use control'' and  maintenance of the undivided interest all of the owners have in the  common areas. These powers normally include management which may, if  desired, be delegated to a professional manager. However, if the board  of directors wants professional management, the management agreement  must be terminable for cause upon 30 days' notice, and run for a  reasonable period of from 1 to 3 years and be renewable for consent of  the association and the management. (Management contracts negotiated by  the declarant should not exceed 2 years.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Commercial areas. With respect to existing and proposed  condominiums, commercial areas within condominium   developments are acceptable, but such interests will be considered in  value.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(2), 3710(a)(6))  (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection requirements in this section under control number 2900-0448)  [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008.
