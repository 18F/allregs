You may limit the number of months of your entitlement in the 6-month or 12-month period. You may state this choice any time before a decision is made on your claim by indicating, in writing, the month you want your benefits to begin. You may change the first month of entitlement in this 6-month or 12-month period after a decision has been made on your claim under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You file the request in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are filing for the claimant, he or she is alive when the request is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any other person who is entitled to benefits would lose some or all of those benefits because of the change, that person, or the person who filed for him or her, consents in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any benefit payments that would become improper as a result of the change in entitlement month are repaid, or we are satisfied that they will be repaid.
