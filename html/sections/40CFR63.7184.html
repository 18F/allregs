                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you have a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in Sec. 63.7182(b), you must comply with all applicable emission limitations in this section on and after the compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.7183.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Process vents--organic HAP emissions. For each organic HAP process vent, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements of Sec. 63.982(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the emissions of organic HAP from the process vent stream by 98 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted organic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process vents--inorganic HAP emissions. For each inorganic HAP process vent, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must limit inorganic HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.983 (closed vent system requirements) and Sec. 63.994 (halogen

scrubber requirements); the applicable general monitoring requirements of Sec. 63.996; the applicable performance test requirements; and the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from the process vent stream by 95 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Storage tanks. For each storage tank, 1,500 gallons or larger, you must limit total HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section if the emissions from the storage tank vent contains greater than 0.42 ppmv inorganic HAP. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your storage tank through a closed vent system to a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.983 (closed vent system requirements) and 63.994 (halogen scrubber requirements); the applicable general monitoring requirements of Sec. 63.996; the applicable performance test requirements; and the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from each storage tank by 95 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must comply with the applicable work practice standards and operating limits contained in Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2). The closed vent system inspection requirements of Sec. 63.983(c), as referenced by Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2), do not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Process vents--combined HAP emissions. For each combined HAP process vent, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 14.22 ppmv. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements of Sec. 63.982(a)(2).
