                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When required. As soon as practical after restoration is  requested by the lessor, a terminal condition report to reflect the  condition of the leased property as of the termination of the lease, and  a terminal survey to determine the extent of restoration required, if  any, will be prepared. The lessor will be invited to have his estimators  accompany the survey party. The lessor's estimates of restoration costs  should be obtained promptly, and included in the terminal survey for  purposes of comparison in accordance with paragraph (c) of Sec.  644.454. Survey and condition reports will not be limited to items for  which the lessor specifically requests restoration, but will include all  items which the DE determines should be restored in order to fulfill the  Government's obligation under the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. The report will show, in detail, the work items  necessary to place the premises in as good a condition as they were at  the time they were taken over by the Government, as disclosed by the  survey and condition report made at that time, reasonable and ordinary  wear and tear, damages by the elements, or circumstances over which the  Government has no control, excepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Housing leases. The tenant of leased housing is personally  responsible for damage to the property, beyond reasonable and ordinary  wear and tear, resulting from his acts, the acts of members of his  family, his invitees and licensees. Restoration of leased housing  therefor should be coordinated with the using service to minimize  payments for repairs which are the obligation of the Government's  tenant.</p>
