                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Curative action. Upon receipt of an acceptable certificate of  title, ENG Form 903 or an interim binder on an owner's title guarantee  or insurance policy, ENG Form 1014, the title evidence will be reviewed  by a qualified real estate attorney of the Corps of Engineers. Where the  title evidence indicates that the acquisition of the land or interest  therein by purchase is feasible, and a satisfactory ENG Form 42, Offer  to Sell Real Property, or ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, is  received from the landowner and accepted by the Government, curative  action will be conducted and curative material will be processed as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With regard to the title objections set forth in Schedule ``B''  of certificates of title or interim binders, it will be necessary to  take such curative action as will insure the issuance of a final  certificate of title or title guarantee or insurance policy showing  title vested in the United States of America, subject only to those  objections, if any, which have been administratively waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As set forth in the title contract, the title company will  authorize its local representative to give final approval of curative  material furnished to satisfy such objections and insure their  elimination from the final certificate of title or title guarantee or  insurance policy. As such curative material is approved, the local  representative of the title company will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initial, or otherwise indicate, on the margin of the preliminary  certificate or interim binder, the fact that the objection has been  eliminated through the procurement of satisfactory curative material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine whether or not he wishes the curative instrument  recorded and if the instrument is to be recorded, so indicate on the  margin of the certificate or interim binder. By the express terms of the  offer to sell, the vendor is responsible for payment of recording fees  on such curative material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where curative material is not recorded, the title company  will be permitted to retain such material if they wish it for their  files; otherwise, it will be placed with the title assembly. If the  original curative instruments are retained by the title company, true  copies will be transmitted with the   Final Title Assembly to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intermediate certificates or interim binders. In the following  types of cases, it may be necessary, after examination of the  preliminary certificates of title or interim binder, to obtain  intermediate certificates of title or interim binders in order to  perfect title prior to closing the transaction:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the signer of the offer is not the record title holder but  is the holder of a contract for purchase, recorded or unrecorded, the  preliminary certificate of title or interim binder will show title in  the record title holder. In such cases, the certificate or binder will  make appropriate reference to the contract. It will recite the action  necessary to complete the contract and effect transfer of title from the  record holder to the contract purchaser. When the deed to the contract  purchaser is recorded, an intermediate certificate of title or interim  binder, in proper form, will be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those cases in which record title is vested in a deceased  person, the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder may be  issued in the name of the deceased record owner, followed by the word  ``deceased,'' and will be accompanied by a letter from the title company  stating whether a judicial proceeding will be required, or whether  affidavits of heirship, or other forms of proof, will suffice to permit  the issuance of intermediate certificate or binder showing title vested  in the heirs of the deceased.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where a judicial proceeding is required, action will immediately  be taken by the owners to perfect title by such proceeding, and, upon  completion, an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder  should be obtained. If such action cannot be completed within 60 days,  action will be taken to acquire the tract by condemnation, Sec.  644.72(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a judicial proceeding is not required, it will be  necessary to effect the necessary curative action and obtain an  intermediate certificate or interim binder showing title in the heirs of  the deceased record owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In those cases in which conveyance to the United States is to be  made by a fiduciary, a corporation, a political subdivision, or an  unincorporated association, the certificate of title or interim binder  will state whether the proposed grantor has legal authority to convey  valid title to the United States, and, if so, will cite the source of  the authority. If the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder  does not so indicate, it will be returned to the title company for  correction or for issuance of an intermediate certificate of title or  interim binder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the certificate of title or interim binder contains any  objection, or reference to liens of taxes, assessments, bonds, or other  indebtedness of a road improvement, school, drainage, or other type of  special improvement district, the specifications provide that the  certificate or interim binder will also contain reference to the statute  or statutes, under which the district was created, its bonds issued, and  its taxes levied; the amount of taxes and assessments levied and bonds  issued; and other additional pertinent information. If the preliminary  certificate or interim binder does not contain sufficient information to  enable an examining attorney to determine the nature and extent of the  lien, if any, on the land, of such taxes, assessments and bonds, it will  be returned to the title company for correction or for issuance of an  intermediate certificate of title or interim binder. If the preliminary  certificate or interim binder does not clearly indicate that the bonds  or taxes of such district become a lien annually at the same time as the  lien of ad valorem taxes attaches to land in the State and that the lien  is of the same nature as the lien of ad valorem taxes, the information  specified above must be obtained and a determination must be made as to  the nature and extent of the liens of such bonds and taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the certificate of title or interim binder discloses a  covenant or condition restricting the use of the land, the certificate  or interim binder will set forth the restriction, will quote the  provision imposing the restriction or creating the right of reverter for  a breach thereof, and will state whether a release will eliminate the  objection. If such information is not contained in the preliminary  certificate of title or interim binder, it will be returned to   the title company for correction or for issuance of an intermediate  certificate of title or interim binder. If a release will eliminate the  objection, action will be taken to obtain an appropriate release from  the person or persons holding the right of reverter. Should the title  company hold that the title cannot be perfected by a release or if an  acceptable release cannot be obtained, action will be taken to acquire  the tract by condemnation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the specifications require the title company to include any  of the above information in the preliminary certificate of title or  interim binder and it is necessary to obtain an intermediate certificate  of title or interim binder due to the omission of such information from  the preliminary report by the title company, the intermediate  certificate of title or interim binder will be furnished without cost to  the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Question of law. Any difficult or complicated question of law  raised by an objection or exception in a preliminary or intermediate  certificate of title or interim binder should be submitted to HQDA  (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for review and transmittal to the Attorney  General for an opinion. The letter of submittal shall contain a full  statement of the facts and references to the provisions of applicable  statutes and pertinent decisions of state courts on the question  involved. This action should be taken before closing. This action should  also be taken on questions involving the nature and extent of the liens  of bonded indebtedness, assessments, or taxes to meet the bonded  indebtedness of special improvement districts, or relating to  restrictive covenants.</p>
