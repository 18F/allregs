                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA) contained an  allowance for the exemption of certain passenger vessels that are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than  500 gross tons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of a vessel must have applied for an  exemption under the PVSA by June 21, 1994, and then brought the vessel  into compliance with the interim guidance in Navigation and Inspection  Circular (NVIC) 7-94 not later than December 21, 1996. The PVSA  exemption is valid for the service life of the vessel, as long as the  vessel remains certified for passenger service. If the Certificate of  Inspection (COI) is surrendered or otherwise becomes invalid (not  including a term while the vessel is out of service but undergoing an  inspection for recertification), the owner or operator must meet the  appropriate inspection regulations to obtain a new COI without the PVSA  exemption. See 46 CFR 175.118 for information about applicable  regulations for vessels that operate under the PVSA exemption.  [USCG-1999-5040, 67 FR 34791, May 15, 2002]</p>
