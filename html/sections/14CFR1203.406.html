                            <p class="depth0">In determining the appropriate classification category, the  following additional factors should be considered:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Uniformity within government activities. The effect  classification will have on technological programs of other Government  departments and agencies should be considered. Classification of  official information must be reasonably uniform within the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of classification directives of other Government  agencies. It is necessary to determine whether authoritative  classification guidance exists elsewhere for the information under  consideration which would make it necessary to assign a higher  classification than that indicated by the applicable NASA guidance. The  Office of Protective Services will coordinate with the Information  Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Committee and the National  Declassification Center to determine what classification guides are  current.
