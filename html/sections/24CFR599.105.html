                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certification for economic requirements. An official or officials authorized to do so by the nominating State and local governments must certify in writing for HUD's acceptance that the nominated area is an area of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and that the nominated area meets the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and, in the case of urban areas, paragraph (d) of this section. HUD's acceptance of the certification is subject to a review of data supporting the certification, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unemployment requirement. A nominated area meets the unemployment requirement if the unemployment rate in the nominated area taken as a whole was at least one and one-half times (150% of) the national unemployment rate for the period to which such data relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Poverty requirement. A nominated area meets the poverty requirement if the poverty rate for each population census tract within the nominated area is at least 20 percent. In the case of a nominated area that is within an Indian reservation, and cannot equivalently be described with census tracts, the poverty rate of the nominated area taken as a whole is considered for purposes of making this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Income requirement for urban areas. In the case of a nominated urban area, at least 70 percent of the households living in the nominated area must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of the local government or governments in which the nominated area is located. The number of households below 80 percent of the median income in each census tract shall be the number of households with incomes below 80 percent of the Household Adjusted Median Family Income (HAMFI) in each census tract as determined by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> HUD review of supporting data--(1) Unemployment, poverty and income. HUD will review 1990 census data to determine whether to accept a certification that a nominated area meets the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pervasive poverty, unemployment and general distress--(i) Pervasive poverty. Pervasive poverty is demonstrated by evidence that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Poverty, as indicated by the number of persons listed as being in poverty in the 1990 Decennial Census, is widespread throughout the nominated area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Poverty, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, has become entrenched or intractable over time (through comparison of 1980 and 1990 census data or other relevant evidence).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unemployment. Unemployment is demonstrated by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The most recent data available indicating that the annual rate of unemployment for the nominated area is not less than the national annual average rate of unemployment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Evidence of especially severe economic conditions, such as military base or plant closings or other conditions that have brought about significant job dislocation within the nominated area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> General distress. General distress is evidenced by describing adverse conditions within the nominated urban area other than those of pervasive poverty and unemployment. Below average or decline in per capita income, earnings per worker, number of persons on welfare, per capita property tax base, average years of school completed, substantial population decline, and a high or rising incidence of crime, narcotics use, homelessness, high incidence of AIDS, abandoned housing, deteriorated infrastructure, school dropouts, teen pregnancy, incidence of domestic violence, incidence of certain health conditions and illiteracy are examples of appropriate indicators of general distress.</p>
