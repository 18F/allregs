                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Defense (DOD) will establish a flat rate pay  system for nonappropriated fund (NAF) automotive mechanics.

These special  schedules will provide rates of pay for nonsupervisory, leader, and  supervisory employees. These special schedule positions will be  identified by pay plan codes XW (nonsupervisory), XY (leader), and XZ  (supervisory), grades 8-10, and will use the Federal Wage System  occupational code 5823.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOD will issue special wage schedules for NAF automotive  mechanics based on annual special flat rate surveys of similar jobs  conducted in each special schedule wage area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The survey area for these special surveys will include the same  counties as the regular NAF survey area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The survey jobs used will be Automotive Worker and Automotive  Mechanic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The special surveys will include data on automotive mechanics  that are paid under private industry flat rate pay plans as well as  those paid by commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to all standard North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) codes currently used on the regular  surveys, the industries surveyed will include--  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">2012 NAICS Codes                2012 NAICS Industry titles ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 441110....................................

Current employees will be moved to these special  wage schedules on a step-by-step basis. Pay retention will apply to any  employee whose rate of basic pay would otherwise be reduced as a result  of placement in these new special schedules.  [79 FR 22765, Apr. 24, 2014]</p>
