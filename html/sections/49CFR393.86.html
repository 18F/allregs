                                Sec. 393.86  Rear impact guards and rear end protection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements for trailers and semitrailers  manufactured on or after   January 26, 1998. Each trailer and semitrailer with a gross vehicle  weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,000 pounds) or more, and manufactured on  or after January 26, 1998, must be equipped with a rear impact guard  that meets the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.  223 (49 CFR 571.223) in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured.  When the rear impact guard is installed on the trailer or semitrailer,  the vehicle must, at a minimum, meet the requirements of FMVSS No. 224  (49 CFR 571.224) in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured. The  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to pole  trailers (as defined in Sec. 390.5 of this chapter); pulpwood trailers,  low chassis vehicles, special purpose vehicles, wheels back vehicles (as  defined in Sec. 393.5); and trailers towed in driveaway-towaway  operations (as defined in Sec. 390.5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impact guard width. The outermost surfaces of the horizontal  member of the guard must extend to within 100 mm (4 inches) of the side  extremities of the vehicle. The outermost surface of the horizontal  member shall not extend beyond the side extremity of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Guard height. The vertical distance between the bottom edge of  the horizontal member of the guard and the ground shall not exceed 560  mm (22 inches) at any point across the full width of the member. Guards  with rounded corners may curve upward within 255 mm (10 inches) of the  longitudinal vertical planes that are tangent to the side extremities of  the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guard rear surface. At any height 560 mm (22 inches) or more  above the ground, the rearmost surface of the horizontal member of the  guard must be within 305 mm (12 inches) of the rear extremity of the  vehicle. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the rear  surface of the guard from extending beyond the rear extremity of the  vehicle. Guards with rounded corners may curve forward within 255 mm (10  inches) of the side extremity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cross-sectional vertical height. The horizontal member of each  guard must have a cross sectional vertical height of at least 100 mm  (3.94 inches) at any point across the guard width.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certification and labeling requirements for rear impact  protection guards. Each rear impact guard used to satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be permanently  marked or labeled as required by FMVSS No. 223 (49 CFR 571.223, S5.3).  The label must be on the forward-facing surface of the horizontal member  of the guard, 305 mm (12 inches) inboard of the right end of the guard.  The certification label must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The impact guard manufacturer's name and address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The statement ``Manufactured in __'' (inserting the month and  year that the guard was manufactured); and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The letters ``DOT'', constituting a certification by the guard  manufacturer that the guard conforms to all requirements of FMVSS No.  223.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for motor vehicles manufactured after December  31, 1952 (except trailers or semitrailers manufactured on or after  January 26, 1998). Each motor vehicle manufactured after December 31,  1952, (except truck tractors, pole trailers, pulpwood trailers, or  vehicles in driveaway-towaway operations) in which the vertical distance  between the rear bottom edge of the body (or the chassis assembly if the  chassis is the rearmost part of the vehicle) and the ground is greater  than 76.2 cm (30 inches) when the motor vehicle is empty, shall be  equipped with a rear impact guard(s). The rear impact guard(s) must be  installed and maintained in such a manner that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The vertical distance between the bottom of the guard(s) and the  ground does not exceed 76.2 cm (30 inches) when the motor vehicle is  empty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum lateral distance between the closest points between  guards, if more than one is used, does not exceed 61 cm (24 inches);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The outermost surfaces of the horizontal member of the guard  are no more than 45.7 cm (18 inches) from each side extremity of the  motor vehicle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The impact guard(s) are no more than 61 cm (24 inches) forward  of the rear extremity of the motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Construction and attachment. The rear impact guard(s) must be  substantially constructed and attached by means of bolts, welding, or  other comparable means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vehicle components and structures that may be used to satisfy  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Low chassis vehicles,  special purpose vehicles, or wheels back vehicles constructed and  maintained so that the body, chassis, or other parts of the vehicle  provide the rear end protection comparable to impact guard(s) conforming  to the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be  considered to be in compliance with those requirements.
