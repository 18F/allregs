                                301.603-74  Requirement for retention of FAC-C and HHS SAC certification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To maintain FAC-C certification, all warranted Contracting Officers, regardless of series, as well as Contract Specialists, must earn 80 CLPs every 2 years. To maintain HHS SAC certification, all individuals with delegated Contracting Officer authority, including those in the GS-1102, GS-1105, GS-1106, and non-1100 series, must earn a minimum of 40 hours (CLPs) every 2 years after completing all mandatory training requirements. FAC-C and HHS SAC certification will expire if the CLPs are not earned every 2 years (from the date of initial certification or re-certification) and, if applicable, may result in a loss of warrant authority. (Note: The certification programs' continuous learning requirement applies to all applicable personnel, including those who were certified under prior certification programs.)</p>
