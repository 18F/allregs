                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coverage. Subpart C of this part applies to insured state nonmember banks, insured state licensed branches of foreign banks, and subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers, persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clear and conspicuous. The term ``clear and conspicuous'' means reasonably understandable and designed to

call attention to the nature and significance of the information presented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Concise. (i) In general. The term ``concise'' means a reasonably brief expression or statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``concise'' means a reasonably brief expression or statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Combination with other required disclosures. A notice required by this subpart may be concise even if it is combined with other disclosures required or authorized by federal or state law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eligibility information. The term ``eligibility information'' means any information the communication of which would be a consumer report if the exclusions from the definition of ``consumer report'' in section 603(d)(2)(A) of the Act did not apply. Eligibility information does not include aggregate or blind data that does not contain personal identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pre-existing business relationship. (i) In general. The term ``pre-existing business relationship'' means a relationship between a person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``pre-existing business relationship'' means a relationship between a person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A financial contract between the person and the consumer which is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of the person's goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or a policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of pre-existing business relationships. (A) If a consumer has a time deposit account, such as a certificate of deposit, at a depository institution that is currently in force, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a consumer has a time deposit account, such as a certificate of deposit, at a depository institution that is currently in force, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a consumer obtained a certificate of deposit from a depository institution, but did not renew the certificate at maturity, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date of maturity of the certificate of deposit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If a consumer obtains a mortgage, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender sells the consumer's entire loan to an investor, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date it sells the loan, and the investor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer upon purchasing the loan. If, however, the mortgage lender sells a fractional interest in the consumer's loan to an investor but also retains an ownership interest in the loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer, but the investor does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender retains ownership of the loan, but sells ownership of the servicing rights to the consumer's loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. The purchaser of the servicing rights also has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer as of the date it purchases ownership of the servicing rights, but only if it collects payments from or otherwise deals directly with the consumer on a continuing basis.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If a consumer applies to a depository institution for a product or service that it offers, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with

the institution, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the application.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a depository institution about its products or services and provides contact information to the institution, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> If a consumer makes an inquiry to a depository institution by e-mail about its products or services, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the depository institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> If a consumer has an existing relationship with a depository institution that is part of a group of affiliated companies, makes a telephone call to the centralized call center for the group of affiliated companies to inquire about products or services offered by the insurance affiliate, and provides contact information to the call center, the call constitutes an inquiry to the insurance affiliate that offers those products or services. The insurance affiliate has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from its affiliated depository institution to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples where no pre-existing business relationship is created. (A) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the consumer's existing account at a depository institution, the call does not constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the depository institution that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of the account-holding depository institution.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the consumer's existing account at a depository institution, the call does not constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the depository institution that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of the account-holding depository institution.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a consumer who has a deposit account with a depository institution makes a telephone call to an affiliate of the institution to ask about the affiliate's retail locations and hours, but does not make an inquiry about the affiliate's products or services, the call does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate. Also, the affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If a consumer makes a telephone call to a depository institution in response to an advertisement that offers a free promotional item to consumers who call a toll-free number, but the advertisement does not indicate that the depository institution's products or services will be marketed to consumers who call in response, the call does not create a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the depository institution because the consumer has not made an inquiry about a product or service offered by the institution, but has merely responded to an offer for a free promotional item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Solicitation-- (i) In general. The term ``solicitation'' means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``solicitation'' means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by its affiliate as described in this subpart; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such product or service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusion of marketing directed at the general public. A solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general

public. For example, television, general circulation magazine, and billboard advertisements do not constitute solicitations, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from the person initiating the communications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples of solicitations. A solicitation would include, for example, a telemarketing call, direct mail, e-mail, or other form of marketing communication directed to a particular consumer that is based on eligibility information received from an affiliate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You means a person described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
