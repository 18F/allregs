To the extent consistent with protection, cultural resources may also be managed for scientific research, public education and enjoyment. Where interpretation of these sites for public benefit and knowledge is developed, it shall be compatible with the protection of cultural resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The authorized officer shall establish priorities for management emphasis and protection of cultural resources based, in part, on whether the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the Forest Service's determination that a cultural resource is significant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Significant cultural resources are to be protected on-site, unless the authorized officer determines that off-site protection is preferable because adequate protection cannot be provided on-site, the resource is already adequately represented and protected on-site elsewhere, protection on-site is not consistent with the administration of Wilderness Lands, or for other good cause shown. Information about significant cultural resources shall be documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The primary objective of managing paleontological resources is scientific research. Paleontological resources may only be disturbed or removed in conjunction with scientific research and only upon the issuance of prior written authorization of the disturbance or removal activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wilderness Lands.
