                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Title 38 U.S.C., section 1524(b)(2)(A) provides, in  part, that a vocational training program shall consist of vocationally  oriented services and assistance of the kind provided service-disabled  veterans under chapter 31, Title 38 U.S.C., and other services and  assistance of the kind provided under that chapter as are necessary to  enable the veteran to prepare for and participate in vocational training  or employment.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1524(b)(2)(A))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicable chapter 31 rules--general. The rules and procedures  in force for administration of the chapter 31 program (Sec. Sec. 21.1- 21.430) are deemed to be applicable to administration of this program in  so far as their use shall not conflict with 38 U.S.C. 1524 or the rules  under this subpart. Where a particular grouping of chapter 31 rules are  generally applicable, without modification, the rules under this subpart  will be deemed to incorporate the chapter 31 rules. The chapter 31 rules  may be read as written, but terms such as chapter 31 and service- connected disability shall be understood to read chapter 15 and  disabilities whenever used. References in the chapter 31 rules to  benefits (subsistence allowances, loans) or eligibility (dependents,  service-connection, serious employment handicap) are to be considered  inapplicable to this program and do not confer benefits or rights not  provided by 38 U.S.C. 1524.
