Nominations for initial producer and handler  members shall be conducted by the Secretary by either holding meetings  of handlers and producers, or by mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Successor members. Subsequent to the first nomination of  committee members under this part, persons to be nominated to serve on  the committee as producer or handler members shall be selected pursuant  to nomination procedures that shall be established by the committee with  the approval of the Secretary: Provided, That:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any qualified individuals who seek nomination as a producer  member shall submit to the committee an intent to seek office in one  designated district on such form and with such information as the  committee shall designate; ballots, accompanied by the names of all such  candidates, with spaces to indicate voters' choices and spaces for  write-in candidates, together with voting instructions, shall be mailed  to all producers who are on record with the committee within the  respective districts; the person(s) receiving the highest number of  votes shall be the member nominee(s) for that district, and the  person(s) receiving the second highest number of votes shall be the  alternate member nominee(s). In case of a tie vote, the nominee shall be  selected by a drawing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any qualified individuals who seek nomination as a handler  member shall submit to the committee an intent to seek office with such  information as the committee shall designate; ballots, accompanied by  the names of all such candidates, with spaces to indicate voters'  choices and spaces for write-in candidates, together with voting  instructions, shall be mailed to all handlers who are on record with the  committee. For the first handler member seat, the person receiving the  highest number of votes shall be the handler member nominee for that  seat, and the person receiving the second highest number of votes shall  be the alternate member nominee. For the second handler member seat, the  person receiving the highest number of votes representing handler volume  shall be the handler member nominee for that seat, and the person  receiving the second highest number of votes representing handler volume  shall be the alternate member nominee. In case of a tie vote, the  nominee shall be selected by a drawing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Handlers. Only handlers, including duly authorized officers or  employees of handlers, may participate in the nomination of the two  handler member nominees and their alternates. Nomination of the two  handler members and their alternates shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For one handler member nomination, each handler entity shall be  entitled to one vote;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the second handler member nomination, each handler entity  shall be entitled to cast one vote respectively for each ton of assessed  weight of pistachios processed by that handler during the two production  years preceding the production year in which the nominations are made.  For the purposes of nominating handler members and alternates by volume,  the assessed weight of pistachios shall be credited to the handler  responsible under the order for the payment of assessments of those  pistachios. The committee with the approval of the Secretary, may revise  the handler representation on the committee if the committee ceases to  be representative of the industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Producers. Only producers, including duly authorized officers or  employees of producers, may participate in the nomination of nominees  for producer members and their alternates. Each producer shall be  entitled to cast only one vote, whether directly or through an  authorized officer or employee, for each position to be filled in the  district in which the producer produces pistachios. If a producer is  engaged in producing pistachios in more than one district, such producer  shall   select the district in which to participate in the nomination. If a  person is both a producer and a handler of pistachios, such person may  participate in both producer and handler nominations, provided, however,  that a single member may not hold concurrent seats as both a producer  and handler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Member's affiliation.

No handler, and all of its affiliated  handlers, can be represented by more than one handler member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cooperative affiliation. In the case of a producer cooperative,  a producer shall not be deemed to be connected in a proprietary capacity  with the cooperative notwithstanding any outstanding retains,  contributions or financial indebtedness owed by the cooperative to a  producer if the producer has not marketed pistachios through the  cooperative during the current and one preceding production year. A  cooperative that has as its members one or more other cooperatives that  are handlers shall not be considered as a handler for the purpose of  nominating or voting under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Alternate members. Each member of the committee shall have an  alternate member to be nominated in the same manner as the member. Any  alternate serving in the same district as a member where both are  employed by, or connected in a proprietary capacity with the same  corporation, firm, partnership, association, or business organization,  shall serve as the alternate to that member. An alternate member, in the  absence of the member for whom that alternate is selected shall serve in  place of that member on the committee, and shall have and be able to  exercise all the rights, privileges, and powers of the member when  serving on the committee. In the event of death, removal, resignation,  or the disqualification of a member, the alternate shall act as a member  on the committee until a successor member is selected and has been  qualified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Selection by Secretary. Nominations under paragraph (g) of this  section received by the committee for all handler and producer members  and alternate member positions shall be certified and sent to the  Secretary at least 60 days prior to the beginning of each two-year term  of office, together with all necessary data and other information deemed  by the committee to be pertinent or requested by the Secretary. From  those nominations, the Secretary shall select the ten producer and  handler members of the committee and an alternate for each member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Acceptance.

Selected members and alternate members of the  committee shall serve for terms of two years: Provided, That four of the  initially selected producer members and one handler member and their  alternates shall, by a drawing, be seated for terms of one year so that  approximately half of the memberships' terms expire each year. Each  member and alternate member shall continue to serve until a successor is  selected and has qualified. The term of office shall begin on July 1st  of each year. Committee members and alternates may serve up to four  consecutive, two-year terms of office. In no event shall any member or  alternate serve more than eight consecutive years on the committee. For  purposes of determining when a member or alternate has served four  consecutive terms, the accrual of terms shall begin following any period  of at least twelve consecutive months out of office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Qualifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each producer member and alternate shall be,  at the time of selection and during the term of office, a producer or an  officer, or employee, of a producer in the district for which nominated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each handler member and alternate shall be, at the time of  selection and during the term of office, a handler or an officer or  employee of a handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any member or alternate member who at the time of selection was  employed by or affiliated with the person who is nominated, that member  shall, upon termination of that relationship, become disqualified to  serve further as a member and that position shall be deemed vacant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No person nominated to serve as a public member or alternate  public member shall have a financial interest in any pistachio growing  or handling operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Vacancy. Any vacancy on the committee occurring by the failure  of any person selected to the committee to qualify as a member or  alternate member due to a change in status making the member ineligible  to serve, or due to death, removal, or resignation, shall be filled, by  a majority vote of the committee for the unexpired portion of the term.  However, that person shall fulfill all the qualifications set forth in  this part as required for the member whose office that person is to  fill. The qualifications of any person to fill a vacancy on the  committee shall be certified in writing to the Secretary. The Secretary  shall notify the committee if the Secretary determines that any such  person is not qualified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may issue  rules and regulations implementing Sec. Sec. 983.41, 983.42 and 983.43.  [69 FR 17850, Apr. 4, 2004. Redesignated and amended at 74 FR 56541,  Nov. 2, 2009]</p>
