                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every ocean transportation intermediary not located in the United States and every group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries not located in the United States which provides financial coverage for the financial responsibility of a member ocean transportation intermediary shall designate and maintain a person in the United States as legal agent for the receipt of judicial and administrative process, including subpoenas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service of administrative process, other than subpoenas, may be effected upon the legal agent by dispatching a copy of the document to be served by mail or courier service. Administrative subpoenas shall be served in accordance with Sec. 502.134 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the designated legal agent cannot be served because of death, disability, unavailability, termination or expiration of the designation, or if a legal agent authorized to receive such service is not designated in compliance with this section, the Secretary of the Federal Maritime Commission will be deemed to be the legal agent for service of process. Any person serving the Secretary must also send to the ocean transportation intermediary, or group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries which provide financial coverage for the financial responsibilities of a member ocean transportation

intermediary, by mail or courier service at the ocean transportation intermediary's, or group's, address published in its tariff, a copy of each document served upon the Secretary, and shall attest to that service at the time service is made upon the Secretary. For purposes of this paragraph, it is sufficient that a person seeking to serve process on an ocean transportation intermediary, or group of such intermediaries, affirm to the Commission's Secretary that: they have contacted, or attempted to contact, the designated agent to confirm whether it remained authorized to accept service of process; or, if no legal agent is designated in the tariff, that it has no knowledge of the identity of the ocean transportation intermediary's legal agent. Designation of the Commission's Secretary as the legal agent shall survive any cancellation of the OTI's license or tariff and shall continue for the entire period during which claims may be made under the OTI's financial responsibility instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Designations of legal agent under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and provisions relating to service of process under paragraph (c) of this section shall be published in the ocean transportation intermediary's tariff, when required, in accordance with part 520 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Every ocean transportation intermediary using a group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries to cover its financial responsibility requirement under Sec. 515.21(b) shall publish the name and address of the group or association's resident agent for receipt of judicial and administrative process, including subpoenas, in its tariff, when required, in accordance with part 520 of this chapter.
