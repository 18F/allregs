                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and general provisions. This section describes  exhaust emission standards that apply for model year 2018 and later  complete heavy-duty vehicles. These standards are optional for  incomplete heavy-duty vehicles and for heavy duty vehicles above 14,000  pounds GVWR as described in Sec. 86.1801. Greenhouse gas emission  standards are specified in Sec. 86.1818 for MDPVs and in 40 CFR 1037.104  for other HDV. See Sec. 86.1813 for evaporative and refueling emission  standards. This section may apply to vehicles before model year 2018 as  specified in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. Separate requirements  apply for MDPVs as specified in Sec. 86.1811. See subpart A of this part  for requirements that apply for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles and for  heavy-duty engines certified independent of the chassis. The following  general provisions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Test all vehicles as described in this section using a chassis  dynamometer; establish appropriate load settings based on adjusted  loaded vehicle weight (see Sec. 86.1803).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Some provisions apply differently depending on the vehicle's  power-to-weight ratio. Determine a vehicle's power-to-weight ratio by  dividing the engine's rated power by the vehicle's GVWR (in hp/pound).  For purposes of this section, if a test group includes multiple  configurations, use the vehicle with the highest power-to-weight ratio  to characterize the test group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use E10 test fuel as required in Sec. 86.113, except as  specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Measure emissions from hybrid electric vehicles (including plug- in hybrid electric vehicles) as described in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart  F, except that these procedures do not apply for plug-in hybrid electric  vehicles during charge-depleting operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Tier 3 exhaust emission standards. Exhaust emissions may not  exceed the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Measure emissions using the procedures of subpart B of this  part, using specific driving schedules and additional procedures as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is based on testing with the  Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) specified in paragraph (a) of  Appendix I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Heavy-Duty Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (HD-SFTP)  involves testing with the UDDS, the SC03 driving schedule specified in  paragraph (h) of Appendix I of this part, and one of the following  additional driving schedules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For Class 2b vehicles, the US06 driving schedule specified in  paragraph (g) of Appendix I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For Class 2b vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below  0.024 hp/pound that are certified to optional standards under paragraphs  (b)(2) and (4) of this section, the highway portion of the US06 driving  schedule characterized as the ``second bag'' in Sec. 86.159-08(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For Class 3 vehicles, the Hot LA-92 driving schedule as  specified in paragraph (c) of Appendix I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> HD-SFTP emissions are calculated as a composite of test  results over these driving schedules based on the following calculation: HD-SFTP (g/mi) = 0.35.FTP + 0.28.HDSIM + 0.37.SC03 Where: HDSIM = the appropriate driving schedule specified in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You may alternatively use FTP emission results to substitute  for the SC03 value in the calculation under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of  this section for a given vehicle for any testing under   this section. Such vehicles remain subject to the SFTP standard when  tested over the SC03 driving schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Hydrocarbon emission standards are expressed as NMOG; however,  you may measure exhaust emissions based on nonmethane hydrocarbon  instead of NMOG as described in 40 CFR 1066.635.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Table 1 of this section describes fully phased-in Tier 3  standards that apply as specified in this paragraph (b) for the  identified driving schedules. The FTP standards for NMOG+NOX  apply on a fleet-average basis using discrete bin standards as described  in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The bin standards include  additional emission standards for CO emissions, and for  NMOG+NOX standards when testing over the HD-SFTP driving  schedule. Table 1 follows:</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 of Sec. 86.1816-18--Fully Phased-in Tier 3 HDV Exhaust Emission Standards</p><p class="depth0">[Tg/mile] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fleet-average                PM                 Formaldehyde</p><p class="depth0">NMOG+NOX    -----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">HDV class                    ----------------</p><p class="depth0">FTP             FTP           HD-SFTP           FTP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2b..............................................           0.178           0.008       0.010 \1\           0.006 3...............................................           0.247           0.010           0.007           0.006 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ For vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified using the driving</p><p class="depth0">schedule described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the HD-SFTP standard for PM is 0.007 g/mile</p><p class="depth0">instead of the value specified in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The FTP standards specified in this section apply equally for  testing at low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions. The HD- SFTP standards described in this section apply only for testing at low- altitude conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The FTP emission standard for NMOG+NOX is based on a  fleet average in a given model year. You must specify a family emission  limit (FEL) for each test group. The FEL serves as the emission standard  for the test group with respect to all required FTP testing. Calculate  your fleet-average emission level as described in Sec. 86.1860 to show  that you meet the specified standard. For multi-fueled vehicles,  calculate fleet-average emission levels based only on emission levels  for testing with gasoline or diesel fuel. You may generate or use  emission credits for banking and trading and you may use banked or  traded credits for demonstrating compliance with the FTP emission  standard for NMOG+NOX as described in Sec. 86.1861. You  comply with the emission standard for a given model year if you have  enough credits to show that your fleet-average emission level is at or  below the applicable standard. You may exchange credits between or among  any test groups subject to standards under this section. Specify one of  the identified values from Table 2 or Table 3 of this section as the FEL  for demonstrating that your fleet-average emission level complies with  the FTP emission standard for NMOG+NOX. These FEL values  define emission bins that also determine corresponding emission  standards for NMOG+NOX emissions over the HD-SFTP driving  schedule and for CO emissions, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Table 2 of Sec. 86.1816-18--Tier 3 Bin Standards--Class 2b</p><p class="depth0">[g/mile] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">NMOG+NOX                           CO</p><p class="depth0">FEL Name                     ---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">FTP (FEL)      HD-SFTP \1\         FTP           HD-SFTP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bin 250.........................................           0.250           0.800             6.4            22.0 Bin 200.........................................           0.200           0.800             4.2            22.0 Bin 170.........................................           0.170           0.450             4.2            12.0 Bin 150.........................................           0.150           0.450             3.2            12.0 Bin 0 \2\.......................................           0.000           0.000             0.0             0.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified using the driving</p><p class="depth0">schedule described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the following HD-SFTP bin standards for</p><p class="depth0">NMOG+NOX apply instead of those identified in the table: 0.350 g/mile for Bin 150 and Bin 170; and 0.550 g/</p><p class="depth0">mile for Bin 200 and Bin 250.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Vehicles certified to Bin 0 must also meet PM and formaldehyde standards of 0.000 g/mile instead of the</p><p class="depth0">standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3 of Sec. 86.1816-18--Tier 3 Bin Standards--Class 3</p><p class="depth0">[g/mile] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">NMOG+NOX                           CO</p><p class="depth0">FEL Name                     ---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">FTP (FEL)        HD-SFTP           FTP           HD-SFTP ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bin 400.........................................           0.400           0.550             7.3             6.0 Bin 270.........................................           0.270           0.550             4.2             6.0 Bin 230.........................................           0.230           0.350             4.2             4.0 Bin 200.........................................           0.200           0.350             3.7             4.0 Bin 0\1\........................................           0.000           0.000             0.0             0.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Vehicles certified to Bin 0 must also meet PM and formaldehyde standards of 0.000 g/mile instead of the</p><p class="depth0">standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The full Tier 3 program includes new emission standards for  NMOG+NOX, PM, CO, and formaldehyde; it also includes  measurement with a new test fuel and a longer useful life.
