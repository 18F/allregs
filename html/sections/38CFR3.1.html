The reason for which a  serviceperson was detained or interned is immaterial in determining POW  status, except that a serviceperson who is detained or interned by a  foreign government for an alleged violation of its laws is not entitled  to be considered a former POW on the basis of that period of detention  or internment, unless the charges are a sham intended to legitimize the  period of detention or internment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Central Office approval. The Director of the Compensation  Service, VA Central Office, shall approve all VA regional office  determinations establishing or denying POW status, with the exception of  those service department determinations accepted under paragraph (y)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In line of duty.

The term hostile force means any entity other  than an enemy or foreign government or the agents of either whose  actions are taken to further or enhance anti-American military,  political or economic objectives or views, or to attempt to embarrass  the United States.
