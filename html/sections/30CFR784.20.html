                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-subsidence survey. Each application must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A map of the permit and adjacent areas at a scale of 1:12,000, or larger if determined necessary by the regulatory authority, showing the location and type of structures and renewable resource lands that subsidence may materially damage or for which the value or reasonably foreseeable use may be diminished by subsidence, and showing the location and type of drinking, domestic, and residential water supplies that could be contaminated, diminished, or interrupted by subsidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A narrative indicating whether subsidence, if it occurred, could cause material damage to or diminish the value or reasonably foreseeable use of such structures or renewable resource lands or could contaminate, diminish, or interrupt drinking, domestic, or residential water supplies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A survey of the condition of all non-commercial buildings or occupied residential dwellings and structures related thereto, that may be materially damaged or for which the reasonably foreseeable use may be diminished by subsidence, within the area encompassed by the applicable angle of draw; as well as a survey of the quantity and quality of all drinking, domestic, and residential water supplies within the permit area and adjacent area that could be contaminated, diminished, or interrupted by subsidence. If the applicant cannot make this survey because the owner will not allow access to the site, the applicant will notify the owner, in writing, of the effect that denial of access will have as described in Sec. 817.121(c)(4) of this chapter. The applicant must pay for any technical assessment or engineering evaluation used to determine the pre-mining condition or value of such non-commercial buildings or occupied residential dwellings

and structures related thereto and the quantity and quality of drinking, domestic, or residential water supplies. The applicant must provide copies of the survey and any technical assessment or engineering evaluation to the property owner and regulatory authority. However, the requirements to perform a survey of the condition of all noncommercial buildings or occupied residential dwellings and structures related thereto, that may be materially damaged or for which the reasonably foreseeable use may be diminished by subsidence, within the areas encompassed by the applicable angle of draw is suspended per court order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsidence control plan. If the survey conducted under paragraph (a) of this section shows that no structures, or drinking, domestic, or residential water supplies, or renewable resource lands exist, or that no material damage or diminution in value or reasonably foreseeable use of such structures or lands, and no contamination, diminution, or interruption of such water supplies would occur as a result of mine subsidence, and if the regulatory authority agrees with this conclusion, no further information need be provided under this section. If the survey shows that structures, renewable resource lands, or water supplies exist and that subsidence could cause material damage or diminution in value or reasonably foreseeable use, or contamination, diminution, or interruption of protected water supplies, or if the regulatory authority determines that damage, diminution in value or foreseeable use, or contamination, diminution, or interruption could occur, the application must include a subsidence control plan that contains the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the method of coal removal, such as longwall mining, room-and-pillar removal or hydraulic mining, including the size, sequence and timing of the development of underground workings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A map of the underground workings that describes the location and extent of the areas in which planned-subsidence mining methods will be used and that identifies all areas where the measures described in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(7) of this section will be taken to prevent or minimize subsidence and subsidence-related damage; and, when applicable, to correct subsidence-related material damage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the physical conditions, such as depth of cover, seam thickness and lithology of overlaying strata, that affect the likelihood or extent of subsidence and subsidence-related damage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the monitoring, if any, needed to determine the commencement and degree of subsidence so that, when appropriate, other measures can be taken to prevent, reduce or correct material damage in accordance with Sec. 817.121(c) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except for those areas where planned subsidence is projected to be used, a detailed description of the subsidence control measures that will be taken to prevent or minimize subsidence and subsidence-related damage, such as, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Backstowing or backfilling of voids;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Leaving support pillars of coal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Leaving areas in which no coal is removed, including a description of the overlying area to be protected by leaving coal in place; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Taking measures on the surface to prevent or minimize material damage or diminution in value of the surface;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of the anticipated effects of planned subsidence, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For those areas where planned subsidence is projected to be used, a description of methods to be employed to minimize damage from planned subsidence to non-commercial buildings and occupied residential dwellings and structures related thereto; or the written consent of the owner of the structure or facility that minimization measures not be taken; or, unless the anticipated damage would constitute a threat to health or safety, a demonstration that the costs of minimizing damage exceed the anticipated costs of repair;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A description of the measures to be taken in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.41(j) and 817.121(c) of this chapter to replace adversely affected protected water supplies or to mitigate or remedy any subsidence-related material damage to the land and protected structures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other information specified by the regulatory authority as necessary to demonstrate that the operation will be conducted in accordance with Sec. 817.121 of this chapter.
