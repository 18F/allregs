In these cases, the uncontrolled emissions shall be the controlled emissions as calculated on November 15, 1990 for the purpose of determining the uncontrolled emissions as specified in Sec.  63.1257(g) and (h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart may not be credited in an emission averaging group, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not more than 20 processes subject to Sec.  63.1254(a)(1)(i), and 20 storage tanks subject to Sec.  63.1253(b)(1) or (c)(1)(i) at an affected source may be included in an emissions averaging group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  63.1253 shall be satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is greater than or equal to 90 percent for those tanks meeting the criteria of Sec.  63.1253(a)(1) and 95 percent for those tanks meeting the criteria of Sec.  63.1253(a)(2), as demonstrated using the test methods and compliance procedures specified in Sec.  63.1257(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  63.1254(a)(1)(i) shall be satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is greater than or equal to 93 percent, as demonstrated

If a time period less than 3 years is used to set the baseline, the data must represent at least 1 year's worth of data. For any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is also a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the VOC factor is also required. For any reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total PMPU HAP emissions shall be reduced by an amount, in kg/yr, that, when divided by the annual production rate, in kg/yr, and added to the reduction of the production-indexed HAP consumption factor, in kg/kg, yields a value of at least 75 percent of the average baseline HAP production-indexed consumption factor established according to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section according to the equation provided in Sec.  63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(A). The total PMPU VOC emissions shall be reduced by an amount calculated according to the equation provided in Sec.  63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(B). The annual reduction in HAP and VOC air emissions must be due to the use of the following control devices:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares or process heaters.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling of material back to the PMPU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any control device for which the owner or operator can demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will have no effect on the production-indexed consumption factor for the PMPU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator may comply with the requirements in either paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section
