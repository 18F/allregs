See section 162(d) and Sec.  1.162-19. For purposes of this section the initial holder is the  original purchaser who is issued stock of the Federal National Mortgage  Association (FNMA) pursuant to section 303(c) of the Act and who appears  on the books of FNMA as the initial holder. See Sec. 1.162-19.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example: Pursuant to section 303(c) of the Federal National Mortgage  Association Charter Act a certificate of FNMA stock is issued to A as of  January 1, 1961. The issuance price of the stock was $100 and the fair  market value of the stock on the date of issue was $69. A was required  by section 162(d) to treat $31 as a business expense for the year 1961.  The basis of the share of stock in the hands of A, the initial holder,  shall be $69, the amount paid for the stock ($100) reduced by $31.  [T.D. 6690, 28 FR 12254, Nov. 19, 1963]</p>
