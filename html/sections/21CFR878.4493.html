                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An absorbable poly(glycolide/l-lactide) surgical suture (PGL suture) is an absorbable sterile, flexible strand as prepared and synthesized from homopolymers of glycolide and copolymers made from 90 percent glycolide and 10 percent l-lactide, and is indicated for use in soft tissue approximation. A PGL suture meets United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) requirements as described in the U.S.P. ``Monograph for Absorbable Surgical Sutures;'' it may be monofilament or multifilament (braided) in form; it may be uncoated or coated; and it may be undyed or dyed with an FDA-approved color additive. Also, the suture may be provided with or without a standard needle attached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control for this device is FDA's ``Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Surgical Sutures; Guidance for Industry and FDA.'' See Sec. 878.1(e) for the availability of this guidance document.
