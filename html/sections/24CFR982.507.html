The PHA must determine whether the rent to owner  is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable  unassisted units. To make this determination, the PHA must consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the contract  unit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any amenities, housing services, maintenance and utilities to be  provided by the owner in accordance with the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Units assisted by low-income housing tax credits or assistance  under HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.  For a unit receiving low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs) pursuant to  section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or receiving assistance  under HUD's HOME Program (for which the regulations are found in 24 CFR  part 92), a rent comparison with unassisted units is not required if the  voucher rent does not exceed the rent for other LIHTC- or HOME-assisted  units in the project that are not occupied by families with tenant-based  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> LIHTC. If the rent requested by the owner exceeds the LIHTC  rents for non-voucher families, the PHA must perform a rent  comparability study in accordance with program regulations and the rent  shall not exceed the lesser of the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable rent as determined pursuant to a rent comparability  study; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The payment standard established by the PHA for the unit size  involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HOME Program. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Owner certification of rents charged for other units. By  accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the  owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by  the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner  must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by  the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.  [63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998.
