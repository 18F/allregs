                            <p class="depth0">The question pool for each written examination element will be  composed of questions acceptable to the FCC. Each question pool must  contain at least five (5) times the number of questions required for a  single examination. The FCC will issue public announcements detailing  the questions in the pool for each element. COLEMs must use only  currently-authorized (through public notice or other appropriate means)  question pools when preparing a question set for a written examination  element.
