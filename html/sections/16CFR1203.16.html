Two cylindrical rollers that spin freely, with a diameter  of 12.50.5 mm (0.49 in.0.02  in.) and a center-to-center distance of 76.01 mm  (3.00.04 in.), shall make up a stirrup that  represents the bone structure of the lower jaw. The entire dynamic test  apparatus hangs freely on the retention system. The entire mass of the  support assembly, including the 4-kg (8.8-lb) drop weight, shall be 11  kg0.5 kg (24.2 lb1.1 lb).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Place the helmet on the appropriate size  headform on the test device according to the HPI. Fasten the strap of  the retention system under the stirrup.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mark the pre-test position of the retention system, with the  entire dynamic test apparatus hanging freely on the retention system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Raise the 4-kg (8.8-lb) drop weight to a height of 0.6 m (2 ft)  from the stop anvil and release it, so that it impacts the stop anvil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record the maximum elongation of the retention system during the  impact. A marker system or a displacement transducer, as shown in Figure  8 of this part, are two methods of measuring the elongation.</p>
