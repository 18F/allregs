                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the conclusion of the hearing the administrative law judge  prepares a decision stating findings of fact and conclusions, as well as  the reasons for the determinations on all material issues, and making  recommendations as to action which should be taken in the case. The  administrative law judge may recommend dismissal or sustain the  complaint, in whole or in part, and recommend that the respondent cease  and desist from the unlawful acts found and take action to remedy their  effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The administrative law judge's decision is filed with the Board  in Washington, DC, and copies are simultaneously served on each of the  parties. At the same time the Board, through its Executive Secretary,  issues and serves on each of the parties an order transferring the case  to the Board. The parties may accept and comply with the administrative  law judge's recommended order, which, in the absence of exceptions,  shall become the order of the Board. Or, the parties or counsel for the  Board may file exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision  with the Board. Whenever any party files exceptions, any other party may  file an answering brief limited to questions raised in the exceptions  and/or may file cross-exceptions relating to any portion of the  administrative law judge's decision. Cross-exceptions may be filed only  by a party who has not previously filed exceptions. Whenever any party  files cross-exceptions, any other party may file an answering brief to  the cross-exceptions. The parties may request permission to appear and  argue orally before the Board in Washington, DC. They may also submit  proposed findings and conclusions to the Board.</p>
