The hog fuel dryer at Weyerhaeuser Paper Company's Cosmopolis, Washington facility is Emission Unit no. HD-14.</p><p class="depth0">Kraft pulp mill means any stationary source that produces pulp from wood by cooking (digesting) wood chips in a solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The recovery process used to regenerate cooking chemicals is also considered part of the kraft pulp mill.</p><p class="depth0">Kraft recovery furnace means a recovery furnace that is used to burn black liquor produced by the kraft pulping process, as well as any recovery furnace that burns black liquor produced from both the kraft and semichemical pulping processes, and includes the direct contact evaporator, if applicable. Includes black liquor gasification.</p><p class="depth0">Lime kiln means the combustion unit (e.g., rotary lime kiln or fluidized-bed calciner) used at a kraft or soda pulp mill to calcine lime mud, which consists primarily of calcium carbonate, into quicklime, which is calcium oxide (CaO).</p><p class="depth0">Lime production rate means the rate at which dry lime, measured as CaO, is produced in the lime kiln.</p><p class="depth0">Method detection limit means the minimum concentration of an analyte that can be determined with 99 percent confidence that the true value is greater than zero.</p><p class="depth0">Modification means, for the purposes of Sec.  63.862(a)(1)(ii)(E)(1), any physical change (excluding any routine part replacement or maintenance) or operational change (excluding any operational change that occurs during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction) that is made to the air pollution control device that could result in an increase in PM emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Nondetect data means, for the purposes of this subpart, any value that is below the method detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">Nondirect contact evaporator (NDCE) recovery furnace means a kraft or soda recovery furnace that burns black liquor that has been concentrated by indirect contact with steam.</p><p class="depth0">Particulate matter (PM) means total particulate matter as measured by EPA Method 5, EPA Method 17 (Sec.  63.865(b)(1)), or EPA Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means an existing DCE or NDCE recovery furnace, smelt dissolving tank, or lime kiln in a chemical recovery system at a kraft or soda mill.</p><p class="depth0">Recovery furnace means an enclosed combustion device where concentrated black liquor produced by the kraft or soda pulping process is burned to recover pulping chemicals and produce steam.
