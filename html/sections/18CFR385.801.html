Upon the expiration of such period of time, in the absence of a request for hearing, the Commission may forthwith dispose of the matter upon the basis of the pleadings and other submittals and the studies and recommendations of the staff. A party not requesting oral hearing in its pleadings will be deemed to have waived a hearing for the purpose of such disposition, but will not be bound by such a waiver for the purposes of any request for rehearing with respect to an order so entered.</p>
