                                Sec. 3862.1  Lode claim patent applications: General.

Sec. 3862.1-1  Application for patent.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time the proof of posting is filed the claimant must file in duplicate an application for patent showing that he has the possessory right to the claim, in virtue of a compliance by himself (and by his grantors, if he claims by purchase) with the mining rules, regulations, and customs of the mining district or State in which the claim lies, and with the mining laws of Congress, such statement to narrate briefly, but as clearly as possible, the facts constituting such compliance, the origin of his possession, and the basis of his claim to a patent. The application should contain a full description of the kind and character of the vein or lode and should state whether ore has been extracted therefrom; and if so, in what amount and of what value. It should also show the precise place within the limits of each of the locations embraced in the application where the vein or lode has been exposed or discovered and the width thereof. The showing in these regards should contain sufficient data to enable representatives of the Government to confirm the same by examination in the field and also enable the Bureau of Land Management to determine whether a valuable deposit of mineral actually exists within the limits of each of the locations embraced in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every application for patent, based on a mining claim located after August 1, 1946, shall state whether the claimant has or has not had any direct or indirect part in the development of the atomic bomb project. The application must set forth in detail the exact nature of the claimant's participation in the project, and must also state whether as a result of such participation he acquired any confidential, official information as to the existence of deposits of uranium, thorium, or other fissionable source materials in the lands covered by his application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In applying for patent to a mining claim embracing land lying partly within one proper office and partly within another, a full set of papers must be filed in each office, except that one abstract of title and one proof of patent expenditures will be sufficient. Only one newspaper publication and one posting on the claim will be required, but proof thereof must be filed in both offices, the statements as to posting plat and notice on the claim to be signed within the respective land districts, as well, also, as all of the other statements required in mineral patent proceedings, except such as, under the law, may be signed outside of the land district wherein the land applied for is situated. Publication, payment of fees, and the purchase price of the land will be further governed by the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1823.4(a) and 1861.2 of this chapter.



Sec. 3862.1-2  Fees.</p><p class="depth0">An applicant for a lode mining claim patent must pay fees as described in Sec. 3860.1.
[70 FR 58880, Oct. 7, 2005]


Sec. 3862.1-3  Evidence of title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each patent application must be supported by either a certificate of title or an abstract of title certified to by the legal custodian of the records of locations and transfers of mining claims or by an abstracter of titles. The certificate of title or certificate to an abstract of title must be by a person, association, or corporation authorized by the State laws to execute such a certificate and acceptable to the Bureau of Land Management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A certificate of title must conform substantially to a form approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each certificate of title or abstract of title must be accompanied by single copies of the certificate or notice of the original location of each claim, and of the certificates of amended or supplemental locations thereof, certified to by the legal custodian of the record of mining locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certificate to an abstract of title must state that the abstract is a full, true, and complete abstract of the location certificates or notices, and all amendments thereof, and of all deeds, instruments, or actions appearing of record purporting to convey or to affect the title to each claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The application for patent will be received and filed if the certificate of title or an abstract is brought down to a day reasonably near the date of the presentation of the application and shows full title in the applicant, who must as soon as practicable thereafter file a supplemental certificate of title or an abstract brought down so as to include the date of the filing of the application.


Sec. 3862.1-4  Evidence relating to destroyed or lost records.</p><p class="depth2">In the event of the mining records in any case having been destroyed by fire or otherwise lost, a statement of the fact should be made, and secondary evidence of possessory title will be received, which may consist of the statement of the claimant, supported by those of any other parties cognizant of the facts relative to his location, occupancy, possession, improvements, etc.; and in such case of lost records, any deeds, certificates of location or purchase, or other evidence which may be in the claimant's possession and tend to establish his claim, should be filed.


Sec. 3862.1-5  Statement required that land is unreserved, unoccupied, unimproved, and unappropriated.</p><p class="depth2">Each person making application for patent under the mining laws, for lands in Alaska, must furnish a duly corroborated statement showing that no portion of the land applied for is occupied or reserved by the United States, so as to prevent its acquisition under said laws; that the land is not occupied or claimed by natives of Alaska; and that the land is unoccupied, unimproved and unappropriated by any person claiming the same other than the applicant.</p>
