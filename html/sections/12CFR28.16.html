                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. In carrying out this section, the OCC shall consider the  importance of according foreign banks competitive opportunities equal to  those of United States banks and the availability of credit to all  sectors of the United States economy, including international trade  finance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. An uninsured Federal branch may accept initial deposits  of less than the standard maximum deposit insurance amount as defined in  12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(1)(E) only from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United  States at the time of the initial deposit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals who are not citizens of the United States, but are  residents of the United States, and are employed by a foreign bank,  foreign business, foreign government, or recognized international  organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Persons (including immediate family members of an individual) to   whom the branch or foreign bank (including any affiliate thereof) has  extended credit or provided other nondeposit banking services within the  past 12 months, or with whom the branch or foreign bank has a written  agreement to extend credit or provide such services within 12 months  after the date of the initial deposit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foreign businesses and large United States businesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Foreign governmental units, including political subdivisions,  and recognized international organizations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Federal and state governmental units, including political  subdivisions and agencies thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Persons who are depositing funds in connection with the issuance  of a financial instrument by the branch for transmission of funds, or  transmission of funds by any electronic means;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Persons who may deposit funds with an Edge corporation as  provided in the FRB's Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.6, including persons  engaged in certain international business activities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any other depositor if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of deposits received from those depositors  does not exceed, on an average daily basis, 1 percent of the average of  the branch's deposits for the last 30 days of the most recent calendar  quarter, excluding deposits of other offices, branches, agencies, or  wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The branch does not solicit deposits from the general public by  advertising, display of signs, or similar activity designed to attract  the attention of the general public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application for an exemption. A foreign bank may apply to the  OCC for an exemption to permit an uninsured Federal branch to accept or  maintain deposit accounts that are not listed in paragraph (b) of this  section. The request should describe:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The types, sources, and estimated amounts of such deposits and  explain why the OCC should grant an exemption; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How the exemption maintains and furthers the policies described  in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aggregation of deposits. For purposes of paragraph (b)(9) of  this section, a foreign bank that has more than one Federal branch in  the same state may aggregate deposits in all of its Federal branches in  that state, but exclude deposits of other branches, agencies or wholly  owned subsidiaries of the bank. The Federal branch shall compute the  average amount by using the sum of deposits as of the close of business  of the last 30 calendar days ending with and including the last day of  the calendar quarter, divided by 30. The Federal branch shall maintain  records of the calculation until its next examination by the OCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification to depositors. A Federal branch that accepts  deposits pursuant to this section shall provide notice to depositors  pursuant to 12 CFR 346.207, which generally requires that the Federal  branch conspicuously display a sign at the branch and include a  statement on each signature card, passbook, and instrument evidencing a  deposit that the deposit is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transition period. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An uninsured Federal branch may maintain  a deposit lawfully accepted under the exemptions existing prior to July  1, 1996 if the deposit would qualify for an exemption under paragraph  (b) of this section, except for the fact that the deposit was made  before July 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a deposit lawfully accepted under the exemption existing  prior to July 1, 1996 would not qualify for an exemption under paragraph  (b) or (c) of this section, the uninsured Federal branch must terminate  the deposit no later than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of time deposits, the maturity of a time deposit or  October 1, 1996, whichever is longer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of all other deposits, five years after July 1,  1996.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Insured banks in United States territories. For purposes of this  section, the term ``foreign bank'' does not include any bank organized  under the laws of any territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam,  American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands whose deposits are insured by the  FDIC pursuant to   the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.
