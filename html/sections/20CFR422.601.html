                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart describe how the Social Security Administration (SSA) will conduct reviews of assignments it makes under provisions of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the Coal Act). Under the Coal Act, certain retired

coal miners and their eligible family members (beneficiaries) are assigned to particular coal operators (or related persons). These operators are then responsible for paying the annual health and death benefit premiums for these beneficiaries as well as the annual premiums for certain unassigned coal miners and eligible members of their families. We will notify the assigned operators of these assignments and give each operator an opportunity to request detailed information about an assignment and to request review of an assignment. We also inform the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Combined Benefit Fund Trustees of each assignment made and the unassigned beneficiaries so they can assess appropriate annual premiums against the assigned operators. This subpart explains how assigned operators may request such additional information, how they may request review of an assignment, and how reviews will be conducted.</p>
