Experimental runs may include, but are not limited to, runs using resin with a higher free-formaldehyde content than specified in the OMM plan, or using experimental pollution prevention techniques. To conduct a short-term experimental production run, you must complete the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prepare an application to the Administrator for approval to conduct the experimental production runs.
