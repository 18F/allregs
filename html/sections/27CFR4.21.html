                            <p class="depth0">Standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set forth in this part shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class 1; grape wine--(1) Grape wine is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes (including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must, and with or without added grape brandy or alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That the product may be ameliorated before, during or after fermentation by either of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grape wine is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes (including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must, and with or without added grape brandy or alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That the product may be ameliorated before, during or after fermentation by either of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more than 35 percent; but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content derived by fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By adding, separately or in combination, not more than 20 percent by weight of dry sugar, or not more than 10 percent by weight of water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of domestic wine, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5383.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for natural red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for other grape wine: Provided, That the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 milliliters for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 milliliters for white wine. Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, or pulp of grapes may be designated as ``red wine,'' ``pink (or rose) wine,'' ``amber wine,'' or ``white wine'' as the case may be. Any grape wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further designated as ``natural.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Table wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as ``light wine,'' ``red table wine,'' ``light white wine,'' ``sweet table wine,'' etc., as the case may be.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dessert wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as ``sherry''. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as ``angelica,'' ``madeira,'' ``muscatel,'' or ``port'' respectively. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as ``light sherry,'' ``light angelica,'' ``light madeira,'' ``light muscatel'' or ``light port,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class 2; sparkling grape wine. (1) Sparkling grape wine (including ``sparkling wine,'' ``sparkling red wine'' and ``sparkling white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sparkling grape wine (including ``sparkling wine,'' ``sparkling red wine'' and ``sparkling white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Champagne is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to champagne as made in the champagne district of France.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for ``champagne'' may, in addition

to but not in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine,'' be further designated as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for ``champagne'' may, in addition

to but not in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine,'' be further designated as:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ``Champagne style;'' or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> ``Champagne type;'' or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> ``American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,'' along with one of the following terms: ``Bulk process,'' ``fermented outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation before bottling,'' ``not fermented in the bottle,'' or ``not bottle fermented.'' The term ``charmat method'' or ``charmat process'' may be used as additional information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the consumer with adequate information about the method of production and origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components of the further designation and the optional term ``charmat method'' or ``charmat process,'' as well as the contrast between the lettering and its background, and the placement of information on the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of the required class designation ``sparkling wine,'' upon a finding that such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production of the sparkling wine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine (including cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated ``crackling wine--bulk process,'' and the words ``bulk process'' shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size as the words ``crackling wine.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class 3; carbonated grape wine. ``Carbonated grape wine'' (including ``carbonated wine,'' ``carbonated red wine,'' and ``carbonated white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide other than that resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Class 4; citrus wine.
