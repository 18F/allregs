                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary identification of regions should be made by the Governor or his representative after consultation with regional and areawide planning agencies, water quality and solid waste management planning agencies, cities, and counties and other appropriate units of general purpose local government. The Governor should notify the concerned agencies of his recommendations concerning boundaries. Where the regional identification has already been established by State legislation or other method in keeping with these guidelines, this notification need only request comments on the existing arrangement.
