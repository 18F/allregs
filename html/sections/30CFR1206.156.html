                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the value of gas has been determined pursuant to Sec.  1206.152 or Sec. 1206.153 of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales point  or point of value determination) off the lease, ONRR shall allow a  deduction for the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee to  transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products from a  lease to a point off the lease including, if appropriate, transportation  from the lease to a gas processing plant off the lease and from the  plant to a point away from the plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transportation costs must be allocated among all products  produced and transported as provided in Sec. 1206.157.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for  unprocessed gas valued in accordance with Sec. 1206.152 of this  subpart, the transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a sales  type code may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed gas  determined under Sec. 1206.152 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for gas  production valued in accordance with Sec. 1206.153 of this subpart, the  transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a sales type code may  not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas or gas plant  product determined under Sec. 1206.153 of this subpart. For purposes of  this section, natural gas liquids will be considered one product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon request of a lessee, ONRR may approve a transportation  allowance deduction in excess of the limitations prescribed by  paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The lessee must  demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the  limitations prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section  were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception  (using Form ONRR-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance  Limitation) must contain all relevant and supporting documentation  necessary for ONRR to make a determination. Under no circumstances may  the value for royalty purposes under any sales type code be reduced to  zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, after a review or audit, ONRR determines that a lessee has  improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this  subpart, then the lessee must pay any additional royalties, plus  interest, determined in accordance with Sec. 1218.54 of this chapter,  or will be entitled to a credit, with interest. If the lessee takes a  deduction for transportation on Form ONRR-2014 by improperly netting the  allowance against the sales value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas,  and gas plant products instead of reporting the allowance as a separate  entry, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
