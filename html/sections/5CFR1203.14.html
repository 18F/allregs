                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Parties. In every case, the person requesting regulation review  must serve a copy of the request on the Director of OPM. In addition,  when the implementation of a regulation is being challenged, the  requester must also serve a copy of the request on the head of the  implementing agency. A copy of all other pleadings must be served, by  the person submitting the pleading, on each other party to the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of serving documents. Pleadings may be served on parties  by mail, by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by commercial delivery.  Service by mail is accomplished by mailing the pleading to each party or  representative, at the party's or representative's last known address.  Service by facsimile is accomplished by transmitting the pleading by  facsimile to each party or representative. Service by personal delivery  or by commercial delivery is accomplished by delivering the pleading to  the business office or home of each party or representative and leaving  it with the party or representative, or with a responsible person at  that address. Regardless of the method of service, the party serving the  document must submit to the Board, along with the pleading, a  certificate of service as proof that the document was served on the  other parties or their representatives. The certificate of service must  list the names and addresses of the persons on whom the pleading was  served, must state the date on which the pleading was served,   must state the method (i.e., mail, personal delivery, facsimile, or  commercial delivery) by which service was accomplished, and must be  signed by the person responsible for accomplishing service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic filing. Other than the initial request for a  regulation review, pleadings in a regulation review proceeding may be  filed with the Board and served upon other parties by electronic filing,  provided the requirements of Sec. 1201.14 of this chapter are satisfied.
