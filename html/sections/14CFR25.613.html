                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material strength properties must be based on enough tests of  material meeting approved specifications to establish design values on a  statistical basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Material design values must be chosen to minimize the  probability of structural failures due to material variability. Except  as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, compliance must  be shown by selecting material design values which assure material  strength with the following probability:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where applied loads are eventually distributed through a single  member within an assembly, the failure of which would result in loss of  structural integrity of the component, 99 percent probability with 95  percent confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For redundant structure, in which the failure of individual  elements would result in applied loads being safely distributed to other  load carrying members, 90 percent probability with 95 percent  confidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The effects of environmental conditions, such as temperature and  moisture, on material design values used in an essential component or  structure must be considered where these effects are significant within  the airplane operating envelope.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Greater material design values may be used if a ``premium  selection'' of the material is made in which a specimen of each  individual item is tested before use to determine that the actual  strength properties of that particular item will equal or exceed those  used in design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other material design values may be used if approved by the  Administrator.
