The TAL is equivalent to the annual coastwide commercial quota.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periodicity. The TAL may be established on an annual basis for up to

5 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC recommendations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance review. The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to TALs in conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 648.230(b).
