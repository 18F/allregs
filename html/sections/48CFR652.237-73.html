Name and address of U.S. person or organization providing this information:________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Introduction. Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. 4864), as amended, provides that a ``United States person'' or a ``qualified United States joint venture'' must meet certain requirements, listed in the Act, to be eligible for the statutory preference. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person entitled to preference under Section 136, guidance is hereby provided. Only those prospective offerors submitting a properly completed and certified Volume 5 with their initial proposals will be considered in the determination of eligibility for assignment of preference as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person. For ease of reference, statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of another organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or local, national or offshore organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. The contract resulting from this solicitation shall not allow subcontracting. A prospective offeror may be a sole proprietorship, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture with no written agreement. To be considered a ``qualified joint venture person,'' the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. joint venture person listed in Section 136. By signing this proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia.''</p><p class="depth0">Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility--</p><p class="depth0">Incorporated means the state of legal recognition as an artificial person that may be afforded to a business entity pursuant to the

laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Legally organized means the state of legal recognition that may be afforded to a business entity that is other than a corporation pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof. This is the least form of legal recognition that will qualify an offeror for this preference. Only those prospective offerors that have legal status, including the right to bring suit, to sign contracts, and to hold property under the law of the jurisdiction under which they are doing business will qualify as legally organized. A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in his or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a ``person legally organized'' within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction where he or she is located.</p><p class="depth0">United States means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth0">Question 1.

What kind of tax return was or will be filed, and in what jurisdiction, during the current calendar year?

Organizations that have changed only their names meet the continuity requirement of this subsection. Organizations that have been bought, sold, merged, or otherwise substantially altered or enlarged their principal business activities will have the burden of proving that there have been ongoing operations by the same business entity for the required period of time.

Section 136(d)(1): ``The term `United States person' means a person which `` (F)(i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; and (F)(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the United States.''</p><p class="depth0">Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility--</p><p class="depth0">Full-time (positions) means those personnel positions in which the occupants are expected to and ordinarily work for 40 or more hours per week.</p><p class="depth0">In the United States refers to those personnel positions that are encumbered as of the date of this solicitation and that the prospective offeror maintains in geographic locations within the jurisdictions defined above as constituting the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent (positions) means personnel positions that are intended to be indefinite as to length of employment, as opposed to limited, seasonal, or project-length personnel appointments.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent, full-time positions means that portion of the prospective offeror's workforce that continues to be employed without regard to the ordinary fluctuations of production or projects.</p><p class="depth0">Principal management positions means those personnel positions including at least the chief executive officer (if any) and the chief operating officer (whether by title or by function) of the organization seeking eligibility, together with all those management officials who constitute the highest levels of management authority within the organization.
