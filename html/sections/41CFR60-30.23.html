                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the Government. At any time after the expiration of 20 days  from the commencement of the action, or after service of a motion for  summary judgment by the respondent, the Government may move with or  without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment upon all claims or  any part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For defendant. The defendant may, at any time after commencement  of the action, move with or without supporting affidavits for summary  judgment in its favor as to all claims or any part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other parties. Any other party to a formal proceeding under this  part may support or oppose motions for summary judgment made by the  Government or respondent, in accordance with this section, but may not  move for a summary judgment in his own behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statement of uncontested facts. All motions for summary judgment  shall be accompanied by a ``Statement of Uncontested Facts'' in which  the moving party sets forth all alleged uncontested material facts which  shall provide the basis for its motion. At least 5 days prior to the  time fixed for hearing on the motion, any party contending that any  material fact regarding the matter covered by the motion is in dispute,  shall file a ``Statement of Disputed Facts.'' Failure to file a  ``Statement of Disputed Facts'' shall be deemed as an admission to the  ``Statement of Uncontested Facts.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Motion and proceedings. The motion shall be served upon all  parties at least 15 days before the time fixed for the hearing on the  motion. The adverse party or parties may serve opposing affidavits prior  to the day of hearing. The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith  if the complaint and answer, depositions, and admissions on file,  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment rendered for or against  the Government or the respondent shall constitute the findings and  recommendations on the issues involved. Hearings on motions made under  this section shall be scheduled by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Case not fully adjudicated on motion. If on motion under this  section judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the  relief asked and a final hearing is necessary, the Administrative Law  Judge at the hearing of the motion, by examining the   notice and answer and the evidence before him and by interrogating  counsel, shall, if practicable, ascertain what material facts exist  without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and  in good faith controverted. He shall thereupon make an order specifying  the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the  extent to which relief is not in controversy, and directing such further  proceedings as are just. At the hearing on the merits, the facts so  specified shall be deemed established, and the final hearing shall be  conducted accordingly.  [43 FR 49259, Oct. 20, 1978; 43 FR 51401, Nov. 3, 1978]</p>
