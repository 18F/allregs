                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Textile or apparel product manufacturer identification. All  commercial importations of textile or apparel products must identify on  CBP Form 3461 (Entry/Immediate Delivery) and CBP Form 7501 (Entry  Summary), and in all electronic data transmissions that require  identification of the manufacturer, the manufacturer of such products  through a manufacturer identification code (MID) constructed from the  name and address of the entity performing the origin-conferring  operations pursuant to Sec. 102.21 or Sec. 102.22 of this part, as  applicable. The code must be accurately constructed using the  methodology set forth in the appendix to this part, including the use of  the two-letter International Organization for Standardization (ISO) code  for the country of origin of such products. When a single entry is filed  for products of more than one manufacturer, the products of each  manufacturer must be separately identified. Importers must be able to  demonstrate to CBP their use of reasonable care in determining the  manufacturer. If an entry filed for such merchandise fails to include  the MID properly constructed from the name and address of the  manufacturer, the port director may reject the entry or take other  appropriate action. For purposes of this paragraph, ``textile or apparel  products'' means goods classifiable in Section XI, Harmonized Tariff  Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and goods classifiable in any 10- digit HTSUS number outside of Section XI with a three-digit textile  category number assigned to the specific subheading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incomplete or insufficient information. If the port director is  unable to determine the country of origin of a textile or apparel  product, the importer must submit additional information as requested by  the port director. Release of the product from CBP custody will be  denied until a determination of the country of origin is made based upon  the information provided or the best information available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date of exportation. For quota, visa or export license  requirements, and statistical purposes, the date of exportation for  textile or apparel products listed in Sec. 102.21(b)(5) will be the  date the vessel or carrier leaves the last port in the country of  origin, as determined by application of Sec. 102.21 or Sec. 102.22, as  applicable. Contingency of diversion in another foreign territory or  country will not change the date of   exportation for quota, visa or export license requirements or for  statistical purposes.  [CBP Dec. 05-32, 70 FR 58013, Oct. 5, 2005, as amended at CBP Dec. 11- 09, 76 FR 14584, Mar. 17, 2011]</p>
