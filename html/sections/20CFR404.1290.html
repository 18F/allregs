                            <p class="depth0">What decisions will be reviewed. A State, under section 218(s) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of Pub.

L. 99-509, may request review of an assessment of an amount due from the State, an allowance to the State of a credit or refund of an overpayment, or a disallowance of the State's claim for credit or refund of an overpayment. The Commissioner may review regardless of whether the amount assessed has been paid or whether the credit or refund has been accepted by the State. Prior to the Commissioner's review, however, an assessment, allowance or disallowance may be reconsidered under Secs. 404.1291 through 404.1293.
