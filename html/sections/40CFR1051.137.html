                            <p class="depth0">Label every vehicle certified under this part with a removable hang- tag showing its emission characteristics relative to other models. The  label should be attached securely to the vehicle before it is offered  for sale in such a manner that it would not be accidentally removed  prior to sale. Use the applicable equations of this section to determine  the normalized emission rate (NER) from the FEL for your vehicle. If the  vehicle is certified without a family emission limit that is different  than the otherwise applicable standard, use the final deteriorated  emission level. Round the resulting normalized emission rate for your  vehicle to one decimal place. If the calculated NER value is less than  zero, consider NER to be zero for that vehicle. We may specify a  standardized format for labels. At a minimum, the tag should include:  the manufacturer's name, vehicle model name, engine description (500 cc  two-stroke with DFI), the NER, and a brief explanation of the scale (for  example, note that 0 is the cleanest and 10 is the least clean).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For snowmobiles, use the following equation:  NER = 16.61 x log (2.667 x HC + CO)-38.22  Where:  HC and CO are the cycle-weighted FELs (or emission rates) for</p><p class="depth2">hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For off-highway motorcycles, use the following equations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For off-highway motorcycles certified to the standards in Sec.   1051.105, use one of the equations specified below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the vehicle has HC + NOX emissions less than or  equal to 2.0 g/km, use the following equation:  NER = 2.500 x (HC+NOX)  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth4">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/km.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the vehicle has HC + NOX emissions greater than  2.0 g/km, use the following equation:  NER = 5.000 x log(HC+NOX)+ 3.495  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth4">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/km.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For off-highway motorcycles certified to the standards in Sec.   1051.615(b), use the following equation:  NER = 8.782 x log(HC+NOX) -5.598  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth3">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For ATVs, use the following equations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For ATVs certified to the standards in Sec.  1051.107, use one  of the equations specified below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the vehicle has HC + NOX emissions less than or  equal to 1.5 g/km, use the following equation:  NER = 3.333 x (HC+NOX)  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth4">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/km.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the vehicle has HC + NOX emissions greater than  1.5 g/km, use the following equation:  NER = 4.444 x log(HC+NOX)+4.217  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth4">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/km.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For ATVs certified to the standards in Sec.  1051.615(a), use  the following equation:  NER = 8.782 x log(HC + NOX) -7.277  Where:  HC+NOX is the FEL (or the sum of the cycle-weighted emission</p><p class="depth3">rates) for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in g/kW-hr.
