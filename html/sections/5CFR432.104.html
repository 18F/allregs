                            <p class="depth0">At any time during the performance appraisal cycle that an  employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more  critical elements, the agency shall notify the employee of the critical  element(s) for which performance is unacceptable and inform the employee  of the performance requirement(s) or standard(s) that must be attained  in order to demonstrate acceptable performance in his or her position.  The agency should also inform the employee that unless his or her  performance in the critical element(s) improves to and is sustained at  an acceptable level, the employee may be reduced in grade or removed.  For each critical element in which the employee's performance is  unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee a reasonable  opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, commensurate with the  duties and responsibilities of the employee's position. As part of the  employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, the agency  shall offer assistance to the employee in improving unacceptable  performance.
