Such action shall be effective upon receipt of notice from the Service by the respondent. Within 30 calendar days after issuing a notice of summary action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c) of this section. Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the action if alternative employment arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made for the respondent by the employer of the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for other than summary action.
