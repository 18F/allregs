The continuity of a period of an  individual's Federal military service shall not be deemed to be  interrupted by reason of any ``days lost'' in such period, but ``days  lost'' shall not be counted for purposes of determining:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether an individual has performed Federal military service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether an individual meets the wage and employment requirements  of a State law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of an individual's Federal military wages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of military accrued leave. A State agency shall  allocate the number of days of unused military leave specified in an ex- servicemember's military document, for which a lump-sum payment has been  made, in the same manner as similar payments by private employers to  their employees are allocated under the applicable State law, except  that the applicable Schedule of Remuneration instead of the lump-sum  payment shall be used to determine the amount of the claimant's Federal  military wages. In a State in which a private employer has an option as  to the period to which such payments shall be allocated, such payments  shall be allocated to the date of the individual's latest discharge or  release from Federal military service. An allocation under this  paragraph shall be disregarded in determining whether an individual has  had a period of active service constituting Federal military service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Education and training allowances. An individual is not entitled  to UCX under the Act or this part for a period with respect to which the  individual receives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subsistence allowance for vocational rehabilitation training  under chapter 31 of title 38 of the United States Code, 38 U.S.C. 1501  et seq., or under part VIII of Veterans Regulation Numbered 1(a); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An educational assistance allowance or special training  allowance under chapter 35 of title 38 of the United States Code, 38  U.S.C. 1700 et seq.</p>
