                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A lead agency, with the approval of OPM, may establish special  rates for use within all or part of a wage area for a designated  occupation or occupational specialization and grade, in lieu of rates on  the regular schedule. OPM may authorize special rates to the extent it  considers necessary to overcome existing or likely significant handicaps  in the recruitment or retention of well-qualified personnel when these  handicaps are due to any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rates of pay offered by private sector employers for an  occupation or occupational specialization and grade are significantly  higher than those paid by the Federal Government within the competitive  labor market;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The remoteness of the area or location involved; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other circumstances that OPM considers appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In authorizing special rates, OPM shall consider--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of existing or likely vacant positions and the length  of time they have been vacant, including evidence to support the  likelihood that a recruitment problem will develop if one does not  already exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of employees who have or are likely to quit,  including the number quitting for higher pay positions and evidence to  support the likelihood that employees will quit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of vacancies employing agencies tried to fill and the  number of hires and offers made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The nature of the existing labor market;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The degree to which employing agencies have considered or used  increased minimum rates for hard-to-fill positions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The degree to which employing agencies have considered relevant  non-pay solutions to the staffing problem, such as conducting an  aggressive recruiting program, using appropriate appointment  authorities, redesigning jobs, establishing training programs, and  improving working conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The impact of the staffing problem on employers' missions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The level of private sector rates paid for comparable positions;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> As appropriate, the extent to which the use of unrestricted  rates authorized under Sec. 532.801 of this part was considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining at what level to set special rates, OPM shall  consider--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The level of rates it believes necessary to recruit or retain an  adequate number of well-qualified persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The offsetting costs that will be incurred if special rates are  not authorized; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The level of private sector rates paid for comparable positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No one factor or combination of factors specified in paragraphs  (b) or (c) of this section requires special rates to be established or  to be adjusted to any given level. Each request to establish special  rates shall be judged on its own merits, based on the extent to which it  meets these factors. Increased minimum rates are not a prerequisite to  the establishment of special rates under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rates shall be based on private sector wage data, or a  percentage thereof, as specified by OPM at the time the special rates  are authorized. The private sector data shall be calculated as a  weighted average or payline, as appropriate. A single rate shall be used  when this represents private sector practice, and five rates shall be  used when rate ranges are used by the private sector. When a five-step  rate range is used, the differentials between steps shall be set in  accordance with Sec. 532.203(f) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Once approved by OPM, special rates may be adjusted by the lead  agency on the same cycle as the applicable regular schedule to the  extent deemed necessary to ensure the continued recruitment or retention  of well-qualified personnel. The amount of the special rate adjustment  may be up to the percentage (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1  percent) by which the market rate has changed since the last adjustment.  Special rates may not exceed the percentage of market rates initially  approved by OPM unless a request for higher special rates is made and  approved under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any special rates established under paragraph (a) of this  section shall be shown on the regular schedule or published as an  amendment to the regular schedule and shall indicate the wage area (or  part thereof) and each occupation or occupational specialization and  grade for which the rates are authorized. These rates shall be paid by  all agencies having such positions in the wage area (or part thereof)  specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The scheduled special rate payable under this section may not,  at any time, be less than the unrestricted (uncapped) rate otherwise  payable for such positions under the applicable regular wage schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If a special rate is terminated under paragraph (f) of this  section, the lead agency shall provide written notice of such  termination to OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Employers using special rates shall maintain current recruitment   and retention data for all authorized special rates. Such data shall be  made available to the lead agency prior to the wage area regular  schedule adjustment date for the purpose of determining whether there is  a continuing need for special rates and the amount of special rate  adjustment necessary to recruit or retain well-qualified employees.
