The Underwriting Agent is authorized to issue a  facultative policy in Form MA-316, prescribed in Sec. 308.545, when  there has been presented to him a properly prepared binder on Form MA- 315, prescribed in Sec. 308.544, together with the payment of the  premium as required, and such policy shall be issued as soon as possible  after the binder form has been presented to the Underwriting Agent.  Prior to the issuance of the policy, the Underwriting Agent is  authorized to accept the risk on behalf of the Maritime Administrator by  signing the binder. The Maritime Administrator will provide each  Underwriting Agent with a supply of facultative policies which shall not  be valid until countersigned by the Underwriting Agent. The Underwriting  Agent shall keep a permanent record of all such policies and the Assured  to whom the policy is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Numbering. Each Facultative Cargo Policy supplied to the  Underwriting Agent by the Maritime Administrator shall be numbered by  MARAD before it is supplied to the Underwriting Agent. No two numbers  shall be the same. The Underwriting Agent when issuing the policy shall  add at the end of the Policy number the agency number assigned to that  Underwriting Agent, and where policies are issued by more than one  office of an Underwriting Agent the issuing office shall also be  identified in the policy number. For example, the policies issued by an  office in New York will be designated ``NY'' and policies issued in San  Francisco will be designated by ``SF'' prefixed to the Underwriting  Agent's agency number.</p>
