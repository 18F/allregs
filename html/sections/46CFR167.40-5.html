The system shall operate from a continuous source of electric energy capable of supplying the system for a period of at least 8 hours without being dependent upon the main, auxiliary or emergency generating plants. Each bell shall produce a signal of a tone distinct from that of other bell signals in the vicinity and shall be independently fused, with each of these fuses located above the bulkhead deck. The bells shall be controlled by a manually-operated contact maker located in the pilothouse. The characteristics of the contact maker shall be such that it possesses:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Positive contact;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Watertightness (when located in open spaces subject to weather);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Means whereby its electrically open or closed position can be determined by sense of touch;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Means to affect a make-or-break circuit for signaling; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Self-maintaining contacts.</p>
