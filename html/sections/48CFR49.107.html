                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The TCO shall refer each prime contractor settlement proposal of $100,000 or more to the appropriate audit agency for review and recommendations. The TCO may submit settlement proposals of less than $100,000 to the audit agency. Referrals shall indicate any specific information or data that the TCO desires and shall include facts and circumstances that will assist the audit agency in performing its function. The audit agency shall develop requested information and may make any further accounting reviews it considers appropriate. After its review, the audit agency shall submit written comments and recommendations to the TCO. When a formal examination of settlement proposals under $100,000 is not warranted, the TCO will perform or have performed a desk review and include a written summary of the review in the termination case file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The TCO shall refer subcontract settlements received for approval or ratification to the appropriate audit agency for review and recommendations when (1) the amount exceeds $100,000 or (2) the TCO wants a complete or partial accounting review. The audit agency shall submit written comments and recommendations to the TCO. The review by the audit agency does not relieve the prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor of the responsibility for performing an accounting review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The responsibility of the prime contractor and of each subcontractor (see 49.108) includes performance of accounting reviews and any necessary field audits. However, the TCO should request the Government audit agency to perform the accounting review of a subcontractor's settlement proposal when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsibility of the prime contractor and of each subcontractor (see 49.108) includes performance of accounting reviews and any necessary field audits. However, the TCO should request the Government audit agency to perform the accounting review of a subcontractor's settlement proposal when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A subcontractor objects, for competitive reasons, to an accounting review of its records by an upper tier contractor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Government audit agency is currently performing audit work at the subcontractor's plant, or can perform the audit more economically or efficiently;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Audit by the Government is necessary for consistent audit treatment and orderly administration; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The contractor has a substantial or controlling financial interest in the subcontractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The audit agency should avoid duplication of accounting reviews performed by the upper tier contractor on subcontractor settlement proposals. However, this should not preclude the Government from making additional reviews when appropriate. When the contractor is performing accounting reviews according to this section, the TCO should request the audit agency to periodically examine the contractor's accounting review procedures and performance, and to make appropriate comments and recommendations to the TCO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The audit report is advisory only, and is for the TCO to use in negotiating a settlement or issuing a unilateral determination. Government personnel handling audit reports must be careful not to reveal privileged information or information that will jeopardize the negotiation position of the Government, the prime contractor, or a higher tier subcontractor. Consistent with this, and when in the Government's interest, the TCO may furnish audit reports under paragraph (c) above to prime and higher tier subcontractors for their use in settling subcontract settlement proposals.
