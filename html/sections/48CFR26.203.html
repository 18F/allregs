                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In anticipation of potential emergency response requirements,  agencies involved in response planning should consider awarding  emergency response contracts before a major disaster or emergency occurs  to ensure immediate response and relief. These contracts should be  structured to respond to immediate emergency response needs, and should  not be structured in any way that may inhibit the transition of  emergency response work to local firms (e.g., unnecessarily broad scopes  of work or long periods of performance).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> requires that agencies performing response,  relief, and reconstruction activities transition to local firms any work  performed under contracts in effect on the date on which the President  declares a major disaster or emergency, unless the head of such agency  determines in writing that it is not feasible or practicable. This  determination may be made on an individual contract or class basis. The  written determination shall be prepared within a reasonable time given  the circumstances of the emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In effecting the transition, agencies are not required to  terminate or renegotiate existing contracts. Agencies should transition  the work at the earliest practical opportunity after consideration of  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The potential duration of the disaster or emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The severity of the disaster or emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The scope and structure of the existing contract, including its  period of performance and the milestone(s) at which a transition is  reasonable (e.g., before exercising an option).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The potential impact of a transition, including safety, national  defense, and mobilization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The expected availability of qualified local offerors who can  provide the products or services at a reasonable price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency shall transition the work to local firms using the  local area set-aside identified in 26.202-1.</p>
