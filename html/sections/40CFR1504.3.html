The statement shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify any material facts in controversy and incorporate (by  reference if appropriate) agreed upon facts,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify any existing environmental requirements or policies  which would be violated by the matter,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Present the reasons why the referring agency believes the  matter is environmentally unsatisfactory,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contain a finding by the agency whether the issue raised is of  national importance because of the threat to national environmental  resources or policies or for some other reason,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Review the steps taken by the referring agency to bring its  concerns to the attention of the lead agency at the earliest possible  time, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Give the referring agency's recommendations as to what  mitigation alternative, further study, or other course of action  (including abandonment of the matter) are necessary to remedy the  situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Not later than twenty-five (25) days after the referral to the  Council the lead agency may deliver a response to the Council, and the  referring agency.
