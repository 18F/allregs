                            <p class="depth0">The general rules in 9.505-1 through 9.505-4 prescribe limitations  on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating  organizational conflicts of interest that might otherwise exist in the  stated situations. Some illustrative examples are provided in 9.508.  Conflicts may arise in situations not expressly covered in this section  9.505 or in the examples in 9.508. Each individual contracting situation  should be examined on the basis of its particular facts and the nature  of the proposed contract. The exercise of common sense, good judgment,  and sound discretion is required in both the decision on whether a  significant potential conflict exists and, if it does, the development  of an appropriate means for resolving it. The two underlying principles  are--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a  contractor's judgment; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preventing unfair competitive advantage. In addition to the  other situations described in this subpart, an unfair competitive  advantage exists where a contractor competing for award for any Federal  contract possesses--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proprietary information that was obtained from a Government  official without proper authorization; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Source selection information (as defined in 2.101) that is  relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and  such information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.
