                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must meet all of the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance. To demonstrate initial compliance, the organic HAP emissions from the combined primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations plus all coatings and thinners, except for deadener materials and for adhesive and sealer materials that are not components of glass bonding systems, used in coating operations added to the affected source pursuant to Sec. 63.3082(c) must meet the applicable emission limitation in Sec. 63.3090(b) or Sec. 63.3091(b); and the organic HAP emissions from the electrodeposition primer operation must meet the applicable emissions limitations in Sec. 63.3092(a) or (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with operating limits. Except as provided in Sec. 63.3160(a)(4), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by Sec. 63.3093, using the procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 63.3167 and 63.3168.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance with work practice requirements. You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plans required by Sec. 63.3094(b) and (c) during the initial compliance period, as specified in Sec. 63.3130.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance with emission limits. You must follow the procedures in Sec. 63.3161(e) through (n), excluding materials used in electrodeposition primer operations, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3090(b) or Sec. 63.3091(b). You must follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit in Sec. 63.3092(a), or paragraphs (f) through (g) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in Sec. 63.3092(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determine the mass fraction of each organic HAP in each material used in the electrodeposition primer operation. You must determine the mass fraction of each organic HAP for each material used in the electrodeposition primer operation during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of each organic HAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Capture of electrodeposition bake oven emissions. You must show that the electrodeposition bake oven meets the criteria in sections 5.3 through 5.5 of

Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 and directs all of the exhaust gases from the bake oven to an add-on control device. For purposes of this showing, an electrodeposition bake oven air seal is not considered a natural draft opening provided you demonstrate that the direction of air movement across the interface between the bake oven air seal and the bake oven is into the bake oven. You may use lightweight strips of fabric or paper, or smoke tubes to make such demonstrations. You cannot count air flowing from an electrodeposition bake oven air seal into an electrodeposition bake oven as air flowing through a natural draft opening unless you elect to treat that electrodeposition bake oven air seal as a natural draft opening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Control of electrodeposition bake oven emissions. Determine the efficiency of each control device on each electrodeposition bake oven using the procedures in Sec. Sec. 63.3164 and 63.3166.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Compliance demonstration. To demonstrate initial compliance, the organic HAP emissions from the combined primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations plus all coatings and thinners, except for deadener materials and for adhesive and sealer materials that are not components of glass bonding systems, used in coating operations added to the affected source pursuant to Sec. 63.3082(c) must meet the applicable emission limitation in Sec. 63.3090(b) or Sec. 63.3091(b); the organic HAP emissions from the electrodeposition primer operation must meet the applicable emissions limitations in Sec. 63.3092(a) or (b). You must keep all records as required by Sec. Sec. 63.3130 and 63.3131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.3110, you must submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate from the combined primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations plus all coatings and thinners, except for deadener materials and for adhesive and sealer materials that are not components of glass bonding systems, used in coating operations added to the affected source pursuant to Sec. 63.3082(c) was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3090(b) or Sec. 63.3091(b), and the organic HAP emissions from the electrodeposition primer operation met the applicable emissions limitations in Sec. 63.3092(a) or (b), and you achieved the operating limits required by Sec. 63.3093 and the work practice standards required by Sec. 63.3094.
