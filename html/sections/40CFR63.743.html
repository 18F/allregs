Notification shall be submitted on or before March 1 of each year and shall include the information required in Sec.  63.5(b)(4) for each such spray booth or hangar constructed or reconstructed during the prior calendar year, except that such information shall be limited to inorganic HAP's.

Sec.  63.745(c) and 63.747(c), unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Averaging is allowed only for uncontrolled primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), Type I chemical milling maskants, or Type II chemical milling maskants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Averaging is not allowed between primers and topcoats (including self-priming topcoats).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Averaging is not allowed between Type I and Type II chemical milling maskants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Averaging is not allowed between primers and chemical milling maskants, or between topcoats and chemical milling maskants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each averaging scheme shall be approved in advance by the permitting agency and adopted as part of the facility's title V permit.
