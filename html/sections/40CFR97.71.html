The  owner or operator of such a unit that qualifies to use the low mass  emissions excepted monitoring methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this  chapter or that qualifies to use an alternative monitoring system under  subpart E of part 75 of this chapter shall comply with the following  procedures, as modified by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The  owner or operator of a NOX Budget unit that is subject to an  Acid   Rain emissions limitation and that requires additional CEMS under the  common stack provisions in Sec. 75.72 of this chapter or uses a  NOX concentration CEMS under Sec. 75.71(a)(2) of this  chapter shall comply with the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator  shall ensure that each emission monitoring system required by subpart H  of part 75 of this chapter (which includes the automated data  acquisition and handling system) successfully completes all of the  initial certification testing required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter  by the applicable deadline in Sec. 97.70(b). In addition, whenever the  owner or operator installs an emission monitoring system in order to  meet the requirements of this part in a location where no such emission  monitoring system was previously installed, initial certification in  accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator  makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified emission  monitoring system that may significantly affect the ability of the  system to accurately measure or record NOX mass emissions or  heat input rate or to meet the requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this  chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or operator  shall recertify the emission monitoring system in accordance with Sec.  75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator  makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling  system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack  flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify the  continuous emissions monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b)  of this chapter. Examples of changes that require recertification  include: replacement of the analyzer, complete replacement of an  existing continuous emission monitoring system, or change in location or  orientation of the sampling probe or site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certification approval process for initial certification and  recertification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification of certification. The NOX  authorized account representative shall submit to the Administrator, the  appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting authority written  notice of the dates of certification in accordance with Sec. 97.73.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certification application. The NOX authorized  account representative shall submit to the Administrator, the  appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting authority a  certification application for each emission monitoring system required  under subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. A complete certification  application shall include the information specified in subpart H of part  75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except for units using the low mass emission excepted  methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, the provisional  certification date for a monitor shall be determined in accordance with  Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitor may  be used under the NOX Budget Trading Program for a period not  to exceed 120 days after receipt by the Administrator of the complete  certification application for the monitoring system under paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the  provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the  requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid  quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional  certification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the  provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120  days of receipt of the complete certification application by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certification application formal approval process. The  Administrator will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of  the certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days  of receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the Administrator does not  issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system  that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this  chapter and is included in the certification application will be deemed  certified for use under the NOX Budget Trading Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Approval notice. If the certification application is complete  and shows that each monitoring system   meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this  chapter, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of approval  of the certification application within 120 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Incomplete application notice. A certification application will  be considered complete when all of the applicable information required  to be submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section has been  received by the Administrator. If the certification application is not  complete, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of  incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the NOX  authorized account representative must submit the additional information  required to complete the certification application. If the  NOX authorized account representative does not comply with  the notice of incompleteness by the specified date, then the  Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 120-day review period shall not begin  prior to receipt of a complete certification application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that  any monitoring system or component thereof does not meet the performance  requirements of this part, or if the certification application is  incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section has been met, then the Administrator will  issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification application.  Upon issuance of such notice of disapproval, the provisional  certification is invalidated by the Administrator and the data measured  and recorded by each uncertified monitoring system shall not be  considered valid quality-assured data beginning with the date and hour  of provisional certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this  chapter).
