                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each individual drain system that receives or manages a  Group 1 wastewater stream or a residual removed from a Group 1  wastewater stream, the owner or operator shall comply with the  requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) or with paragraphs (e),  (f), and (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(5)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cover and all openings shall meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the  cover and all openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports) shall be  maintained in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec. 63.148  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cover and all openings shall be maintained in a closed  position at all times that a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual  removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream is in the drain system except  when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for  equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in  accordance with Sec. 63.139 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the  closed-vent system shall be inspected in accordance with Sec. 63.148 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any cover and closed-vent system that is operated and  maintained under negative pressure, the owner or operator is not  required to comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 63.148 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The individual drain system shall be designed and operated to  segregate the vapors within the system from other drain systems and the  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each individual drain system shall be inspected initially, and  semi- annually thereafter, for improper work   practices and control equipment failures, in accordance with the  inspection requirements specified in table 11 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For individual drain systems, improper work practice includes,  but is not limited to, leaving open any access hatch or other opening  when such hatch or opening is not in use for sampling or removal, or for  equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For individual drain systems, control equipment failure  includes, but is not limited to, any time a joint, lid, cover, or door  has a gap or crack, or is broken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 63.140 of this subpart, when an  improper work practice or a control equipment failure is identified,  first efforts at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days  after identification and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar  days after identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each drain equipped with a water seal, the owner or operator  shall ensure that the water seal is maintained. For example, a flow- monitoring device indicating positive flow from a main to a branch water  line supplying a trap or water being continuously dripped into the trap  by a hose could be used to verify flow of water to the trap. Visual  observation is also an acceptable alternative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a water seal is used on a drain receiving a Group 1  wastewater, the owner or operator shall either extend the pipe  discharging the wastewater below the liquid surface in the water seal of  the receiving drain, or install a flexible shield (or other enclosure  which restricts wind motion across the open area between the pipe and  the drain) that encloses the space between the pipe discharging the  wastewater to the drain receiving the wastewater. (Water seals which are  used on hubs receiving Group 2 wastewater for the purpose of eliminating  cross ventilation to drains carrying Group 1 wastewater are not required  to have a flexible cap or extended subsurface discharging pipe.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The junction box shall be vented to a process or through a  closed vent system to a control device. The closed vent system shall be  inspected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.148 and the  control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in accordance  with the requirements of Sec. 63.139.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The vent pipe shall be at least 90 centimeters in length and no  greater than 10.2 centimeters in nominal inside diameter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Water seals shall be installed and maintained at the wastewater  entrance(s) to or exit from the junction box restricting ventilation in  the individual drain system and between components in the individual  drain system. The owner or operator shall demonstrate (e.g., by visual  inspection or smoke test) upon request by the Administrator that the  junction box water seal is properly designed and restricts ventilation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each sewer line shall not be open to the atmosphere and shall be  covered or enclosed in a manner so as to have no visible gaps or cracks  in joints, seals, or other emission interfaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Equipment used to comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), or  (e)(3) of this section shall be inspected as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each drain using a tightly fitting cap or plug shall be visually  inspected   initially, and semi-annually thereafter, to ensure caps or plugs are in  place and that there are no gaps, cracks, or other holes in the cap or  plug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each junction box shall be visually inspected initially, and  semi-annually thereafter, to ensure that there are no gaps, cracks, or  other holes in the cover.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The unburied portion of each sewer line shall be visually  inspected initially, and semi-annually thereafter, for indication of  cracks or gaps that could result in air emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 63.140 of this subpart, when a gap,  hole, or crack is identified in a joint or cover, first efforts at  repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after identification,  and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days after  identification.
