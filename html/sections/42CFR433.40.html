                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section provides the rules to ensure that States  refund the Federal portion of uncashed or cancelled (voided) checks  under title XIX.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2">Cancelled (voided) check means a Medicaid check issued by a State or  fiscal agent which prior to its being cashed is cancelled (voided) by  the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.</p><p class="depth2">Check means a check or warrant that a State or local agency uses to  make a payment.</p><p class="depth2">Fiscal agent means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims  for the Medicaid State agency.</p><p class="depth2">Uncashed check means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal  agent which has not been cashed by the payee.</p><p class="depth2">Warrant means an order by which the State agency or local agency  without   the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation of a  warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue checks  will result in release of funds due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed  checks--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General provisions. If a check remains uncashed beyond a  period of 180 days from the date it was issued; i.e., the date of the  check, it will no longer be regarded as an allowable program  expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of  the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State  must identify those checks which remain uncashed beyond a period of 180  days after issuance. The State agency must refund all FFP that it  received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of  Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the  refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered  to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was  originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the  Act and the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refund of FFP for cancelled (voided) checks--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General  provision. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a  cancelled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State  agency must identify those checks which were cancelled (voided). The  State must refund all FFP that it received for cancelled (voided) checks  by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified  in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.
