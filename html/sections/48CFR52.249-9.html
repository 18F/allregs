However, the Contractor shall  continue the work not terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the  Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to  perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without  the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes  include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the  Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires,  (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8)  freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance  the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault  or negligence of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a  subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the  control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault  or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any  excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies  or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for  the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule or other  performance requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may  require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the Government,  as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed or partially  completed work not previously delivered to, and accepted by, the  Government and (2) other property, including contract rights,  specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this  contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor  shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the  Government has an interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Government shall pay the contract price, if separately  stated, for completed work it has accepted and the amount agreed upon by  the Contractor and the Contracting Officer for (1) completed work for  which no separate price is stated, (2) partially completed work, (3)  other property described above that it accepts, and (4) the protection  and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute  under the Disputes clause. The Government may withhold from these  amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to  protect the Government against loss from outstanding liens or claims of  former lien holders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was  not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and  obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had  been issued for the convenience of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in  addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this  contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 34762, July 3, 1995]</p>
