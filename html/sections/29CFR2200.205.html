                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complaint and answer. Once a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the complaint and answer requirements are suspended. If the Secretary has filed a complaint under Sec. 2200.34(a), a response to a petition under Sec. 2200.37(d)(5), or a response to an employee contest under Sec. 2200.38(a), and if Simplified Proceedings have been ordered, no response to these documents will be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motions. A primary purpose of Simplified Proceedings is to eliminate, as much as possible, motions and similar documents. A motion will not be viewed favorably if the subject of the motion has not been first discussed among the parties.
