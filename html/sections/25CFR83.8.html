                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unambiguous previous Federal acknowledgment is acceptable evidence of the tribal character of a petitioner to the date of the last such previous acknowledgment. If a petitioner provides substantial evidence of unambiguous Federal acknowledgment, the petitioner will then only be required to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of Sec. 83.7 to the extent required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A determination of the adequacy of the evidence of previous Federal action acknowledging tribal status shall be made during the technical assistance review of the documented petition conducted pursuant to Sec. 83.10(b). If a petition is awaiting active consideration at the time of adoption of these regulations, this review will be conducted while the petition is under active consideration unless the petitioner requests in writing that this review be made in advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence to demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence that the group has had treaty relations with the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that the group has been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence that the group has been treated by the Federal Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To be acknowledged, a petitioner that can demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment must show that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 83.7(a), except that such identification shall be demonstrated since the point of last Federal acknowledgment. The group must further have been identified by such sources as the same tribal entity that was previously acknowledged or as a

portion that has evolved from that entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 83.7(b) to demonstrate that it comprises a distinct community at present. However, it need not provide evidence to demonstrate existence as a community historically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) to demonstrate that political influence or authority is exercised within the group at present. Sufficient evidence to meet the criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) from the point of last Federal acknowledgment to the present may be provided by demonstration of substantially continuous historical identification, by authoritative, knowledgeable external sources, of leaders and/or a governing body who exercise political influence or authority, together with demonstration of one form of evidence listed in Sec. 83.7(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The group meets the requirements of the criteria in paragraphs 83.7 (d) through (g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a petitioner which has demonstrated previous Federal acknowledgment cannot meet the requirements in paragraphs (d) (1) and (3), the petitioner may demonstrate alternatively that it meets the requirements of the criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (c) from last Federal acknowledgment until the present.</p>
