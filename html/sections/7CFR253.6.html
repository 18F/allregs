                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Household concept. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall determine  eligibility for the Food Distribution Program on a household basis.  Household means any of the following individuals or groups of  individuals, provided that such individuals or groups are not boarders  or residents of an institution and provided that separate household or  boarder status shall not be granted to a spouse of a member of the  household, or to children under 18 years of age under the parental  control of a member of the household.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual living alone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual living with others, but customarily purchasing  food and preparing meals for home consumption separate and apart from  the others.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A group of individuals living together for whom food is  customarily purchased in common and for whom meals are prepared together  for home consumption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (i) and (v) who are otherwise eligible may participate in the  Program as separate households.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Roomers. Individuals to whom a household furnishes lodging, but  not meals, for compensation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SSI recipients in ``cash-out'' States. Recipients of SSI  benefits who reside in a State designated by the Secretary of Health,  Education, and Welfare to have specifically included the value of the  coupon allotment in its State supplemental payments. These persons are  not eligible for Food Distribution Program benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Disqualified individuals. Individuals disqualified from the  Food Stamp Program for fraud, as set forth in Sec. 273.16.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Illegal residents. Individuals who are not legal residents of  the United States. While U.S. citizenship is not required for  participation in the Food Distribution Program, persons receiving food  distribution benefits must be lawfully living in the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Others. Other individuals who share living quarters with the  household but who do not customarily purchase food and prepare meals  with the household. For example, if the applicant household shares  living quarters with another family to save on rent, but does not  purchase and prepare food together with that family, the members of the  other family are not members of the applicant household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized representatives. The head of the household, spouse,  or any other responsible member of the household may designate an  authorized representative to act on behalf of the household in making  application for commodities and/or obtaining commodities as provided in  Sec. 253.7(a)(10)(i) and Sec. 253.7(a)(10)(ii) respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Residency or citizenship. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All households residing on a  reservation on which the FDPIR operates shall be eligible to apply for  program benefits on that reservation regardless of whether they include  an Indian member. All Indian tribal households as defined in  Sec. 253.2(c) of this part which reside in near areas established under  Sec. 253.4(d) of this part shall be eligible to apply for program  benefits. The ITO or State agency shall serve all income-eligible  applicant households residing on reservations who apply for benefits,  and all income-eligible applicant Indian tribal households residing in  near areas. The ITO or State agency administering the program in a near  area shall, for purposes of determining program eligibility, accept  documentation from a household member's tribe of origin as proof of  tribal membership. Residency shall not mean domicile nor shall the State  agency impose any durational residency requirement. However, persons on  the reservation   solely for vacations shall not be considered residents. No household may  participate in the Food Stamp Program or in the Food Distribution  Program in more than one geographical area at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iv)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Income eligibility standards of public assistance, supplemental  security income, and certain general assistance households. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Households in which all members are included in a federally aided public  assistance or supplemental security income grant, except as provided for  in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, shall, if otherwise eligible  under this part, be determined to be eligible to participate in the Food  Distribution Program while receiving such grants without regard to the  income of the household members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If FNS determines that a State or local general assistance  program applies criteria of need the same as or similar to, those  applied under any of the federally aided public assistance programs,  households in which all members are included in such a general  assistance grant, shall, if otherwise eligible under this part, be  determined to be eligible to participate in the Food Distribution  Program while receiving such grants without regard to the income of  household members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Income eligibility standards for nonassistance  households. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall apply uniform national income  eligibility standards for the Food Distribution Program except for  households in which all members are recipients of public assistance,  supplemental security income except as provided for in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section, or certain  general assistance program payments as provided in Sec. 283.6(c). The  income eligibility standards shall be the applicable SNAP net monthly  income eligibility standards for the appropriate area, increased by the  amount of the applicable SNAP standard deduction for that area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The income eligibility standards for the Food Distribution  Program shall be adjusted each October 1, as necessary, to reflect  changes in the Food Stamp Program income eligibility limits and standard  deductions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definition of income. Household income shall mean all income  from whatever source, excluding only items specified in paragraph (e)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Earned income shall include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All wages and salaries of an employee.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The total gross income from a self-employment enterprise,  including the net profit from the sale of any capital goods or equipment  related to the business. Ownership of rental property shall be  considered a self-employment enterprise. Payments from a roomer and  returns on rental property shall be considered self-employment income.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Training allowances from vocational and rehabilitative programs  recognized by Federal, State or local governments, such as the Work  Incentive Program, and programs authorized by the Job Training  Partnership Act, to the extent they are not a reimbursement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unearned income shall include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Assistance payments from Federal or Federally aided public  assistance programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), General Assistance (GA)  programs, or other assistance programs based on need.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Annuities; pensions; retirement; veteran's or disability  benefits; worker's or unemployment compensation; old-age, survivors, or  social security benefits; strike benefits; foster care payments for  children or adults.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Support or alimony payments made directly to the household from  nonhousehold members.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Scholarships, education grants, fellowships, deferred payment  loans for education, veteran's education benefit and the like in excess  of amounts excluded under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Payments from Government-sponsored programs, dividends,  interest, royalties, and all other direct money payments from any source   which can be construed to be a gain or benefit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Per capita payments that are derived from the profits of Tribal  enterprises and distributed to Tribal members on a monthly basis.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> The earned or unearned income of an individual disqualified from  participation in the Food Stamp Program for fraud shall continue to be  counted as income, less the pro rata share for the disqualified member.  Procedures for calculating this pro rata share are described in  Sec. 253.7.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Income shall not include the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Monies withheld from an assistance payment, earned income or  other income source, or monies received from any income source which are  voluntarily or involuntarily returned to repay a prior overpayment  received from that income source.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Child support payments received by TANF recipients which must be  transferred to the agency administering title IV-D of the Social  Security Act of 1935, as amended, to maintain TANF eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Income exclusions. Only the following items shall be excluded  from household income and no other income shall be disregarded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any gain or benefit which is not in the form of money payable  directly to the household, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In-kind income. Nonmonetary or in-kind benefits, such as meals,  clothing, public housing, or produce from a garden.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Vendor payments. A payment made in money on behalf of a  household shall be considered a vendor payment whenever a person or  organization outside of the household uses its own funds to make a  direct payment to either the household's creditors or a person or  organization providing a service to the household. For example, if a  relative, who is not a household member, pays out of its own resources  the household's rent directly to the landlord, the payment is considered  a vendor payment and is not counted as income to the household. Also,  payments specified by a court order or other written support or alimony  agreement to go directly to a third party rather than the household and  support payments which are paid to a third party are excluded as vendor  payments. Wages garnished or diverted by employers, or money deducted or  otherwise diverted from a household's public assistance grant by a State  for purposes such as managing the household's expenses, shall not be  considered a vendor payment, since the person or organization making the  payment is using money payable to the household rather than its own  funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any income in the certification period which is received too  infrequently or irregularly to be reasonably anticipated, but not in  excess of $30 in a quarter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Education loans on which payment is deferred, grants  scholarships, fellowships, veterans' educational benefits, and the like  to the extent that they are used for tuition and mandatory school fees.  Mandatory fees are those charged to all students or those charged to all  students within a certain curriculum. For example, uniforms, lab fees,  or equipment charged to all students to enroll in a chemistry course  would be excluded. However, transportation, supplies, and textbook  expenses are not uniformly charged to all students and, therefore, would  not be excluded as mandatory fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All loans, including loans from private individuals as well as  commercial institutions, other than education loans on which repayment  is deferred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reimbursements for past or future expenses to the extent they do  not exceed actual expenses. For example, reimbursements of flat  allowances for job or training related expenses such as travel per diem,  uniforms, and transportation to and from the job or training site are  excluded as income.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Monies received and used for care and maintenance of a third  party beneficiary who is not a household member.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The earned income (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this  section) of children who are members of the household, who are students  at least half time and who have not attained their eighteenth birthday.  The exclusion shall continue to apply during temporary interruptions in  school attendance due to semester or vaction breaks, provided the  child's enrollment   will resume following the break. Individuals are considered children for  purposes of this provision if they are under the parental control of  another household member.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Money received in the form of a nonrecurring lump sum  payment, including but not limited to, income tax refunds, rebates, or  credits; retroactive lump-sum social security, SSI, public assistance,  railroad retirement benefits or other payments, or retroactive lump-sum  insurance settlements; refunds of security deposits on rental properties  or utilities or lump-sum payments arising from land interests held in  trust for, or by, a tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The cost of producing self-employment income. The procedures  for computing the cost of producing self-employment income are described  in Sec. 253.7(b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Any income that is specifically excluded by any other Federal  statute from consideration as income. The following Federal statutes  provide such an exclusion.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Reimbursements from the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real  Property Acquisition Policy Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-646, section 216).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Payments received under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act  (Pub. L. 92-203, section 21(a)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any payment to volunteers under Title II (RSVP, foster  grandparents, and others) and title III (SCORE and ACE) of the Domestic  Volunteer Services Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-113), as amended. Payments  under title I (VISTA) to volunteers shall be excluded for those  individuals receiving federally donated commodities, food stamps, or  public assistance at the time they joined the title I program, except  that households which are receiving an income exclusion for a VISTA or  other title I subsistence allowance at the time of implementation of  these rules shall continue to receive an income exclusion for VISTA for  the length of their volunteer contract in effect at the time of  implementation of these rules. Temporary interruptions in food  distribution shall not alter the exclusion once an initial determination  has been made. New applicants who are not receiving federally donated  commodities, food stamps or public assistance at the time they joined  VISTA shall have these volunteer payments included as earned income.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Income derived from certain submarginal land of the United  States which is held in trust for certain Indian tribes (Pub. L. 94-114,  section 6).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Payments received by certain Indian tribal members under Pub. L.  94-540 regarding the Grand River Band of Ottawa Indians.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Combat pay. Combat pay is defined as additional payment that is  received by or from a member of the United States Armed Forces deployed  to a combat zone, if the additional pay is the result of deployment to  or service in a combat zone, and was not received immediately prior to  serving in a combat zone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Per capita payments that are derived from the profits of  Tribal enterprises and distributed to Tribal members less frequently  than monthly (e.g., quarterly, semiannually or annually) are excluded  from consideration as income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Income deductions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Households with earned income, as defined  in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, shall be allowed a deduction of  twenty percent of their earned income. Earned income excluded under  paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall not be considered earned income  for the purpose of computing this deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Households shall also receive a deduction for the actual costs  for the care of a child or other dependent when necessary for a  household member to accept or continue employment or attend training or  pursue education which is preparatory to employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Households will receive a deduction for legally required child  support payments paid by a household member to or for a nonhousehold  member, including payments made to a third party on behalf of the  nonhousehold member (vendor payments). The State agency must allow a  deduction for amounts paid towards overdue child support (arrearages).  Alimony payments made to or for a nonhousehold member cannot be included  in the child support deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Households must receive a medical deduction for that portion of  medical expenses in excess of $35 per   month, excluding special diets, incurred by any household member who is  elderly or disabled as defined in Sec. 253.2 of this chapter. Spouses or  other persons receiving benefits as a dependent of a Supplemental  Security Income (SSI), or disability and blindness recipient are not  eligible to receive this deduction; however, persons receiving emergency  SSI benefits based on presumptive eligibility are eligible for this  deduction. The allowable medical costs are those permitted at 7 CFR  273.9(d)(3) for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Households that incur monthly shelter and utility expenses will  receive a shelter/utility standard deduction, subject to the provisions  below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The household must incur, on a monthly basis, at least one  allowable shelter/utility expense. The allowable shelter/utility  expenses are those permitted at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii) for SNAP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The shelter/utility standard deduction amounts are set by FNS  on a regional basis. The standard deductions are adjusted annually to  reflect changes to SNAP Quality Control data. FNS will advise the State  agencies of the updates prior to October 1 of each year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If eligible to receive a shelter/utility standard deduction,  the applicant household may opt to receive the appropriate deduction  amount for the State in which the household resides or the State in  which the State agency's central administrative office is located.
