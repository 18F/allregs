                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Apply both the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the  Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute to installation support  contracts if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contract is principally for services but also requires a  substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration,  renovation, painting, or repair work; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aggregate dollar value of such construction work exceeds or  is expected to exceed $2,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service Contract Labor Standards statute coverage under the  contract. Contract installation support requirements, such as plant  operation and installation services (i.e., custodial, snow removal,  etc.) are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards. Apply Service  Contract Labor Standards clauses and minimum wage and fringe benefit  requirements to all contract service calls or orders for such  maintenance and support work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute coverage under the  contract. Contract construction, alteration, renovation, painting, and  repair requirements (i.e., roof shingling, building structural repair,  paving repairs, etc.) are subject to the Construction Wage Rate  Requirements statute. Apply Construction Wage Rate Requirements clauses  and minimum wage requirements to all contract service calls or orders  for construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repairs to  buildings or other works.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Repairs versus maintenance. Some contract work may be  characterized as either Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/ repairs or Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance. For example,  replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a wall  could be covered by either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements or  the Service Contract Labor Standards. In those instances where a  contract service call or order requires construction trade skills (i.e.,  carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear whether the work  required is Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance or Construction  Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs, apply the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of  32 or more work hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work  subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individual service calls or orders which will require less than  32 work hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject  to the Service Contract Labor Standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under  an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to  the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute regardless of the total  work hours required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The determination of labor standards application shall be made  at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where  requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be  made at the time the service call or order is placed against the  contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards  law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work  required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contracting officers may not avoid application of the  Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting individual  tasks between orders or contracts.
