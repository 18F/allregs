                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 342.302(c)(3), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Tobacco-free Facilities (January 2006)</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy, the Contractor and its staff are prohibited from using tobacco products of any kind (e.g., cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco) while on any HHS property, including use in personal or company vehicles operated by Contractor employees while on an HHS property. This policy also applies to all subcontracts awarded under the contract or order. The term ``HHS properties'' includes all properties owned, controlled and/or leased by HHS when totally occupied by HHS, including all indoor and outdoor areas of such properties. Where HHS only partially occupies such properties, it includes all HHS-occupied interior space. Where HHS leases space in a multi-occupant building or complex, the tobacco-free HHS policy will apply to the maximum area permitted by both law and current lease agreements. The Contractor shall ensure that each of its employees, and any subcontractor staff, is made aware of, understand, and comply with this policy.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p>
