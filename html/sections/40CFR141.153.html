monitoring for unregulated contaminants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Information on Cryptosporidium, radon, and other contaminants:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the system has performed any monitoring for Cryptosporidium, including monitoring performed to satisfy the requirements of Sec.  141.143, which indicates that Cryptosporidium may be present in the source water or the finished water, the report must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A summary of the results of the monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the significance of the results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the system has performed any monitoring for radon which indicates that radon may be present in the finished water, the report must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The results of the monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the significance of the results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the system has performed additional monitoring which indicates the presence of other contaminants in the finished water, EPA strongly encourages systems to report any results which may indicate a health concern. To determine if results may indicate a health concern, EPA recommends that systems find out if EPA has proposed an NPDWR or issued a health advisory for that contaminant by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791). EPA considers detects above a proposed MCL or health advisory level to indicate possible health concerns. For such contaminants, EPA recommends that the report include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The results of the monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the significance of the results noting the existence of a health advisory or a proposed regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with NPDWR. In addition to the requirements of Sec.  141.153(d)(6), the report must note any violation that occurred during the year covered by the report of a requirement listed below, and include a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation, any potential adverse health effects, and the steps the system has taken to correct the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring and reporting of compliance data;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filtration and disinfection prescribed by subpart H of this part. For systems which have failed to install adequate filtration or disinfection equipment or processes, or have had a failure of such equipment or processes which constitutes a violation, the report must include the following language as part of the explanation of potential adverse health effects: Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites which can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Lead and copper control requirements prescribed by subpart I of this part. For systems that fail to take one or more actions prescribed by Sec. Sec.  141.80(d), 141.81, 141.82, 141.83 or 141.84, the report must include the applicable language of appendix A to this subpart for lead, copper, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment techniques for Acrylamide and Epichlorohydrin prescribed by subpart K of this part. For systems that violate the requirements of subpart K of this part, the report must include the relevant language from appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recordkeeping of compliance data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special monitoring requirements prescribed by Sec. Sec.  141.40 and 141.41; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Violation of the terms of a variance, an exemption, or an administrative or judicial order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Variances and Exemptions. If a system is operating under the terms of a variance or an exemption issued under Sec.  1415 or 1416 of SDWA, the report must contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An explanation of the reasons for the variance or exemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date on which the variance or exemption was issued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A brief status report on the steps the system is taking to install treatment, find alternative sources of water, or otherwise comply with the terms and schedules of the variance or exemption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A notice of any opportunity for public input in the review, or renewal, of the variance or exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Additional information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The report must contain a brief explanation regarding contaminants which may reasonably be expected to be found in drinking water including bottled water. This explanation may

include the language of paragraphs (h)(1) (i) through (iii) or systems may use their own comparable language. The report also must include the language of paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contaminants that may be present in source water include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations which limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. FDA regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water which must provide the same protection for public health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The report must include the telephone number of the owner, operator, or designee of the community water system as a source of additional information concerning the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In communities with a large proportion of non-English speaking residents, as determined by the Primacy Agency, the report must contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of the report or contain a telephone number or address where such residents may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the report or assistance in the appropriate language.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The report must include information (e.g., time and place of regularly scheduled board meetings) about opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The systems may include such additional information as they deem necessary for public education consistent with, and not detracting from, the purpose of the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Systems required to comply with subpart S.
