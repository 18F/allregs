The contracting  officer must inform prospective architect-engineers of this requirement  during the negotiation phase, prior to award of a contract for design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If VA has determined that only one product will meet the  Government's minimum needs and VA will not allow the submission of  ``equal'' products, the contracting officer must include the clause  found at 852.236-90, Restriction on Submission and Use of Equal  Products, in the solicitation and complete the clause by listing the  items to which the clause applies. This clause places bidders on notice  that the ``brand name or equal'' provisions of the clause found at FAR  52.236-5, Materials and Workmanship, and any other provision that may  authorize the submission of an ``equal'' product, will not apply to the  specific items listed.</p>
