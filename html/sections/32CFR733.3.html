                                Sec. 733.3  Information and policy on support of dependents.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The naval service will not be a haven or  refuge for personnel who disregard or evade their obligations to their  families. All members of the naval service are expected to conduct their  personal affairs satisfactorily. This includes the requirement that they  provide adequate and continuous support for their lawful dependents and  comply with the terms of separation agreements and court orders. Failure  to do so which tends to bring discredit on the naval service is a proper  subject of command consideration for initiation of court-martial  proceedings or other administrative or disciplinary action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adequacy of support. Every member has an inherent natural and  moral obligation to support his or her spouse and family. What is  adequate and reasonably sufficient support is a highly complex and  individual matter dependent on numerous factors, and may be resolved  permanently only in the civil courts. Salient factors that should be  considered are the pay of the member, any other private income or  resources of the member and the dependents, the cost of necessities and  every day living expenses and financial obligations of the dependents,  and the expenses and   other financial obligations of the member in relation to his or her  income. The Department of the Navy does not and cannot act as a court in  these matters. It is desired that the amount of support to be provided  for dependents either be established by mutual understanding between the  parties concerned or adjudicated in the civil courts. The support scales  set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not intended as  a fixed rule. They are intended as guidelines and the actual support may  be increased or decreased as the facts and circumstances warrant until  the amount of support to be furnished is settled by agreement of the  parties or adjudicated by the civil courts. Because of the inherent  arbitrary and temporary nature of the support scales set forth below, it  is not intended that they be used as bases for any judicial proceedings,  for to do so would lend excessive credence to administrative tools which  have been designed for use only within the Navy and the Marine Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Support of a lawful wife. The laws of jurisdictions in the  United States impose a legal obligation upon a husband to support his  wife. Exemptions from support of a lawful wife may be in the form of an  order of a civil court of competent jurisdiction, relinquishment by the  wife or mutual agreement of the parties, or a waiver of the naval  support requirement granted by the Director, Navy Family Allowance  Activity or the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payments of alimony. Dependents for whom basic allowance for  quarters or other allowances are payable are defined by law. For  purposes of qualifying for basic allowance for quarters, medical care or  other benefits, a former spouse is not a dependent even though alimony  has been decreed. Members are expected to comply with the terms of court  orders or divorce decrees which adjudge payments of alimony even though  basic allowance for quarters is not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Support of children. The duty of a member to support his or her  minor children is not affected by desertion or other misconduct on the  part of the spouse. The obligation to support a child or children is not  affected by dissolution of the marriage through divorce, unless the  judicial decree or order specifically negates the obligations of the  member to support a child or children of the marriage. The fact that a  divorce decree is silent relative to support of minor children or does  not mention a child or children will not be considered as relieving the  service member of the inherent obligation to provide support for the  child or children of the marriage. In many cases, the courts may not be  cognizant of the existence of a child or children, or may not have  jurisdiction over the child or children. A commanding officer has  discretion to withhold action for alleged failure to support a child  under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the member cannot ascertain the whereabouts and welfare of  the child concerned.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where it is apparent that the person requesting support for a  child does not have physical custody of the child.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where the member has been granted custody of the child by  court order but does not have physical control of the child and the  member is ready, willing, and able to care for and support the child if  physical control is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Adopted children. The natural parents of an adopted child are  relieved of the obligation to support the child as such duty is imposed  on the adoptive parents. A Navy or Marine Corps member who contemplates  the adoption of a child should be aware of the legal obligation to  provide continuous support for such child during minority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Entitlement to basic allowance for quarters. Entitlement of  members to basic allowance for quarters on behalf of dependents is  provided by statute. No member should be denied the right to submit a  claim or application for basic allowance for quarters, nor should any  command refuse or fail to forward any such claim or application. In  cases involving parents, the member should furnish an estimate of the  dependency situation to the best of his or her knowledge. Commanding  officers should not contact parents for dependency information to  include in the member's application. This delays the   application and serves no useful purpose, as such cases are thoroughly  investigated by the Navy Family Allowance Activity or Headquarters  Marine Corps, which obtains necessary dependency affidavits directly  from the parents. Any person, including a service member or dependent  who obtains an allowance by fraudulent means is subject to criminal  prosecution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Application of the rule based on Robey v. United States 71 Ct.  Cl. 561. Determinations that no dependency exists may be made in  disputed cases--if a member does not contribute to the support of spouse  and child at least to the extent of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The full amount of his/her basic allowance for quarters, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An amount specified in a court order or legal separation  agreement, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An amount agreed to by the parties as acceptable, adequate  support, whichever is lesser. Pertinent decisions of the Court of Claims  or Comptroller General will be followed in determinations of dependency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Navy members. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of support to be provided in the  absence of a mutual agreement or court order is as follows:  For spouse only--\1/3\ gross pay For spouse and one minor child--\1/2\ gross pay For spouse and two or more children--\3/5\ gross pay For one minor child--\1/6\ gross pay For two minor children--\1/4\ gross pay For three or more children--\1/3\ gross pay</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this support guide, gross pay will include basic  pay and BAH, but does not include hazardous duty pay, sea or foreign  duty pay, incentive pay, or basic allowance for subsistence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Marine Corps members. (See MCO 5800.16A, Marine Corps Manual for  Legal Administration (LEGADMINMAN))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the absence of a court order or a written agreement between  the parties as to an amount of support to be furnished by the Marine,  the following shall apply to establish interim support requirements.  Note that gross pay is defined as basic pay and BAH, but does not  include hazardous duty pay, incentive pay, or basic allowance for  subsistence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Single family. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a single family living in Government  housing (civilian spouse): interim support shall be $200.00 per  supported person, up to a maximum of \1/3\ gross pay, per month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a single family not living in Government housing (civilian  spouse): interim support shall be either $200.00 per supported family  member, or BAH at the ``with dependents'' rate, whichever is greater, up  to a maximum of \1/3\ gross pay, per month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiple families (not including a spouse in the armed forces).  Interim support for each family member shall be either $200.00 per  supported family member, or the pro rata share of BAH at the ``with  dependents'' rate, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of \1/3\ gross  pay, per month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Both spouses in the armed forces. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No children of the  marriage: no support obligation, regardless of any disparities in pay  grade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All the children of the marriage in the custody of one spouse:  interim support shall be either $200.00 per supported child, or BAH at  the ``with dependents'' rate, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of  \1/3\ gross pay, per month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If custody of children of the marriage is divided between the  two parents: interim support shall be either $200.00 per supported  family member, or the pro rata share of BAH at the ``with dependents''  rate, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of \1/3\ gross pay, per  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Support amounts required pursuant to this section will be paid  until a court order or written agreement is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Form and timing of financial support payments</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unless otherwise required by court order or by written financial  support agreement, a financial support payment will be made in one of  the following ways:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Check.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Money order.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Electronic transfer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Voluntary allotment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Cash.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Involuntary allotment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Garnishment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As an exception to paragraph 15002.6a of the LEGADMINMAN, a  commanding officer may direct compliance with the financial support  requirements of this section by making in-kind financial support. For  example, paying non-Government housing expenses on behalf of family  members, automobile loans, or charge accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Alimony and child support. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dependents for whom BAH or other  allowances are payable are defined by law. For purposes of qualifying  for BAH, medical care, or other benefits, a former spouse is not a  dependent even though alimony has been decreed. Marines are expected to  comply with the terms of court orders which adjudge alimony payments  (even though BAH is not payable) until the responsibility for compliance  is terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction; a written agreement  between the persons concerned; relinquishment by the former spouse in  writing; or the waiver of the support requirement is granted by the  general court-martial (GCM) authority in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the decree is silent as to alimony payments, it is presumed  that the court did not intend such payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a valid court order exists and the Marine concerned is  financially unable to comply, the Marine will be advised that  noncompliance with the terms of that order renders the Marine liable to  further civil court action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The duty of Marines to support their minor children is not  terminated by desertion or other misconduct on the part of the Marine's  spouse. Similarly, the obligation to support a child or children is not  eliminated or reduced by the dissolution of the marriage through  divorce, unless a judicial decree or order specifically negates the  obligation of child support. The fact that a divorce decree is silent  relative to support of minor children, or does not mention a child or  children, will not be interpreted by command authorities as relieving  the Marine of the inherent obligation to provide support for the child  or children of the marriage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A commanding officer may consider releasing a Marine under his/ her command from the specific requirements of this regulation in the  situations described below. A commanding officer may reconsider any  prior decision made by himself/herself or by a prior commanding officer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When the Marine cannot determine the whereabouts and welfare of  the child concerned;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When it is apparent that the person requesting support for the  child does not have physical custody of the child;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When the Marine has been the victim of a substantiated instance  of physical abuse (this section applies only to a requirement to support  a spouse, not dependent children. Commanding officers are strongly  encouraged to consult the installation family counseling center  concerning such issues. In addition, commanders should exercise extreme  caution in denying dependent support in cases where the servicemember is  also a perpetrator of spousal abuse.); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The dependent is in jail.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All command directed support waivers shall be in writing and a  copy shall be provided to the disenfranchised family member by the  command. The command shall also retain a copy. Alleged verbal support  waivers shall be given no force or effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The natural parents of an adopted child are relieved of the  obligation to support the child as such duty is imposed on the adoptive  parent. A Marine who contemplates the adoption of a child should be  aware of the legal obligation to provide continuous support, once  adopted, for such child during its minority.
