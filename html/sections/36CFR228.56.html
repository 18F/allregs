proper protection of the environment and improvements, including timely reclamation of disturbed lands. Significant changes to operations require prior approval of an amended operating plan. The operating plan must include, as a minimum, a map and explanation of the nature of the access, anticipated activity, surface disturbance, and intended reclamation including removal or retention of structures and facilities. Operating plans must be submitted by the purchaser, permittee, or prospecting permittee, except as noted in Sec. 228.64(b).</p><p class="depth0">Types and Methods of Disposal</p>
