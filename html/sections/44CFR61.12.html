                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a  community has made adequate progress on the construction of a flood  protection system involving Federal funds which will significantly limit  the area of special flood hazards, the applicable risk premium rates for  any property, located within a special flood hazard area intended to be  protected directly by such system will be those risk premium rates which  would be applicable when the system is complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adequate progress in paragraph (a) of this section means that  the community has provided information to   the Federal Insurance Administrator sufficient to determine that  substantial completion of the flood protection system has been effected  because:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed  flood protection system has been authorized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 60 percent of the total financial project cost of the  completed flood protection system has been appropriated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least 50 percent of the total financial project cost of the  completed flood protection system has been expended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All critical features of the flood protection system, as  identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator, are under  construction, and each critical feature is 50 percent completed as  measured by the actual expenditure of the estimated construction budget  funds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The community has not been responsible for any delay in the  completion of the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each request by a community for a determination must be  submitted in writing to the Risk Analysis Division, Mitigation  Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington DC, and  contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the flood  protection system, including, but not limited to, supporting technical  data (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood protection project data),  cost schedules, budget appropriation data and the extent of Federal  funding of the system's construction. Such facts shall include  information sufficient to identify all persons affected by such flood  protection system or by such request: A full and precise statement of  intended purposes of the flood protection system; and a carefully  detailed description of such project, including construction completion  target dates. In addition, true copies of all contracts, agreements,  leases, instruments, and other documents involved must be submitted with  the request. Relevant facts reflected in documents, however, must be  included in the statement and not merely incorporated by reference, and  must be accompanied by an analysis of their bearing on the requirements  of paragraph (b) of this section, specifying the pertinent provisions.  The request must contain a statement whether, to the best of the  knowledge of the person responsible for preparing the application for  the community, the flood protection system is currently the subject  matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or  administrative agency, and the purpose of that litigation. The request  must also contain a statement as to whether the community has previously  requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from  the Federal Insurance Administrator, detailing the disposition of such  previous request. As documents become part of the file and cannot be  returned, the original documents should not be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The effective date for any risk premium rates established under  this section shall be the date of final determination by the Federal  Insurance Administrator that adequate progress toward completion of a  flood protection system has been made in a community.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A responsible official of a community which received a  determination that adequate progress has been made towards completion of  a flood protection system shall certify to the Federal Insurance  Administrator annually on the anniversary date of receipt of such  determination that no present delay in completion of the system is  attributable to local sponsors of the system, and that a good faith  effort is being made to complete the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A community for which risk premium rates have been made  available under section 1307(e) of the National Flood Insurance Act of  1968, as amended, shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator if,  at any time, all progress on the completion of the flood protection  system has been halted or if the project for the completion of the flood  protection system has been canceled.
