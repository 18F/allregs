                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency must refund the Federal share  of overpayments that are subject to recovery to CMS through a credit on  its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures (Form CMS-64).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must credit CMS with the Federal share of  overpayments subject to recovery on the earlier of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Form CMS-64 submission due to CMS for the quarter in which  the State recovers the overpayment from the provider; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Form CMS-64 due to CMS for the quarter in which the 1-year  period following discovery, established in accordance with Sec.   433.316, ends.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A credit on the Form CMS-64 must be made whether or not the  overpayment has been recovered by the State from the provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State does not refund the Federal share of such  overpayment as indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the State  will be liable for interest on the amount equal to the Federal share of  the non-recovered, non-refunded overpayment amount. Interest during this  period will be at the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR), and will  accrue beginning on the day after the end of the 1-year period following  discovery until the last day of the quarter for which the State submits  a CMS-64 report refunding the Federal share of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of reporting collections and submitting reduced  expenditure claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State is not required to refund the Federal  share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period if the State has  already reported a collection or submitted an expenditure claim reduced  by a discrete amount to recover the   overpayment prior to the end of the 1-year period following discovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State is not required to report on the Form CMS-64 any  collections made on overpayment amounts for which the Federal share has  been refunded previously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State has refunded the Federal share of an overpayment as  required under this subpart and the State subsequently makes recovery by  reducing future provider payments by a discrete amount, the State need  not reflect that reduction in its claim for Federal financial  participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reclaiming overpayment amounts previously refunded to CMS. If  the amount of an overpayment is adjusted downward after the agency has  credited CMS with the Federal share, the agency may reclaim the amount  of the downward adjustment on the Form CMS-64. Under this provision--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Downward adjustment to an overpayment amount previously credited  to CMS is allowed only if it is properly based on the approved State  plan, Federal law and regulations governing Medicaid, and the appeals  resolution processes specified in State administrative policies and  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 2-year filing limit for retroactive claims for Medicaid  expenditures does not apply. A downward adjustment is not considered a  retroactive claim but rather a reclaiming of costs previously claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expiration of 1-year recovery period. If an overpayment has not  been determined uncollectable in accordance with the requirements of  Sec.  433.318 of this subpart at the end of the 1-year period following  discovery of the overpayment, the agency must refund the Federal share  of the overpayment to CMS in accordance with the procedures specified in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Court-approved discharge of bankruptcy. If the State recovers  any portion of an overpayment under a court-approved discharge of  bankruptcy, the agency must refund to CMS the Federal share of the  overpayment amount collected on the next quarterly expenditure report  that is due to CMS for the period that includes the date on which the  collection occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Bankruptcy petition denied. If a provider's petition for  bankruptcy is denied in Federal court, the agency must credit CMS with  the Federal share of the overpayment on the later of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Form CMS-64 submission due to CMS immediately following the  date of the decision of the court; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Form CMS-64 submission for the quarter in which the 1-year  period following discovery of the overpayment ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reclaim of refunds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a provider is determined bankrupt or  out of business under this section after the 1-year period following  discovery of the overpayment ends and the State has not been able to  make complete recovery, the agency may reclaim the amount of the Federal  share of any unrecovered overpayment amount previously refunded to CMS.  CMS allows the reclaim of a refund by the agency if the agency submits  to CMS documentation that it has made reasonable efforts to obtain  recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency reclaims a refund of the Federal share of an  overpayment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In bankruptcy cases, the agency must submit to CMS a statement  of its efforts to recover the overpayment during the period before the  petition for bankruptcy was filed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In out-of-business cases, the agency must submit to CMS a  statement of its efforts to locate the provider and its assets and to  recover the overpayment during any period before the provider is found  to be out of business in accordance with Sec.  433.318.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Supporting reports. The agency must report the following  information to support each Quarterly Statement of Expenditures Form  CMS-64:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts of overpayments not collected during the quarter but  refunded because of the expiration of the 1-year period following  discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upward and downward adjustments to amounts credited in previous  quarters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts of overpayments collected under court-approved  discharges of bankruptcy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amounts of previously reported overpayments to providers  certified as bankrupt or out of business during the quarter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Amounts of overpayments previously credited and reclaimed by the  State.
