                            <p class="depth0">The Regional Supervisor will disapprove your proposed DPP or DOCD if one of the four reasons in this section applies:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-compliance. The Regional Supervisor determines that you have failed to demonstrate that you can comply with the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (Act), implementing regulations, or other applicable Federal laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No consistency concurrence. (1) An affected State has not yet issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification (see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An affected State has not yet issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification (see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security. In that event, you do not need to resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under Sec.  550.273(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National security or defense conflicts. Your proposed activities would threaten National security or defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptional circumstances. The Regional Supervisor determines because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances that all of the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the National security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The advantages of disapproving your DPP or DOCD outweigh the advantages of development and production.</p>
