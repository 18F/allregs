                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dispositive motions. This section governs the filing of motions to dismiss and motions for summary disposition. The filing of any such motion does not obviate a party's obligation to file an answer or take any other action required by this part or by an order of the hearing officer, unless expressly so provided by the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motions to dismiss. A respondent may file a motion to dismiss asserting that, even assuming the truth of the facts alleged in the notice of charges, it is entitled to dismissal as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motion for summary disposition. A party may make a motion for summary disposition asserting that the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in connection with a motion for summary disposition show that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing of motions for summary disposition and responses. (1) After a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available to the respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to Sec. 1081.206, any party may move for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available to the respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to Sec. 1081.206, any party may move for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, affidavits and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party contends support his or her position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists. Such opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as may be submitted in support of a motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any affidavit or declaration submitted in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary disposition shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein, and must be signed under oath and penalty of perjury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Page limitations for dispositive motions. A motion to dismiss or for summary disposition, together with any brief in support of the motion (exclusive of any declarations, affidavits, or attachments) shall not exceed 35 pages in length. Motions for extensions of this length limitation are disfavored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opposition and reply response time and page limitation. Any party, within 20 days after service of a dispositive motion, or within such time period as allowed by the hearing officer, may file a response to such motion. The length limitations set forth in paragraph (e) of this section shall also apply to such responses. Any reply brief filed in response to an opposition to a dispositive motion shall be filed within five days after service of the opposition. Reply briefs shall not exceed ten pages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Oral argument. At the request of any party or on his or her own motion, the hearing officer may hear oral argument on a dispositive motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decision on motion. Within 30 days following the expiration of the time for filing all responses and replies to any dispositive motion, the hearing officer shall determine whether the motion shall be granted. If the hearing officer determines that dismissal or summary disposition is warranted, he or she shall issue a recommended decision granting the motion. If the hearing officer finds that no party is entitled to dismissal or summary disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying the motion. If it appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present by affidavit, prior to hearing, facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion.</p>
