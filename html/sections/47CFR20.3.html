A mobile service that is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> provided for profit, i.e., with the intent of receiving  compensation or monetary gain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An interconnected service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as  to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The functional equivalent of such a mobile service described in  paragraph (a) of this section, including a mobile broadband Internet  access service as defined in Sec. 8.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Consumer Signal Booster: A bi-directional signal booster that is  marketed and sold to the general public for use without modification.</p><p class="depth0">Designated PSAP.

A Consumer Signal Booster designed to  be operated in a fixed location in a building.</p><p class="depth0">Handset-based location technology. A method of providing the  location of wireless 911 callers that requires the use of special  location-determining hardware and/or software in a portable or mobile  phone. Handset-based location technology may also employ additional  location-determining hardware and/or software in the CMRS network and/or  another fixed infrastructure.</p><p class="depth0">Host Carrier. For automatic roaming, the host carrier is a  facilities-based CMRS carrier on whose system another carrier's  subscriber roams.

Licensees who have obtained  extended implementation authorizations in the 800 MHz or 900 MHz  service, either by waiver or under Section 90.629 of these rules, and  who offer real-time, two-way voice service that is interconnected with  the public switched network.</p><p class="depth0">Industrial Signal Booster: All signal boosters other than Consumer  Signal Boosters.</p><p class="depth0">Interconnection or Interconnected. Direct or indirect connection  through automatic or manual means (by wire, microwave, or other  technologies such as store and forward) to permit the transmission or  reception of messages or signals to or from points in the public  switched network.</p><p class="depth0">Interconnected Service. A service:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> That is interconnected with the public switched network, or  interconnected with the public switched network through an  interconnected service provider, that gives subscribers the capability  to communicate to or receive communication from other users on the  public switched network; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For which a request for such interconnection is pending pursuant  to section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.  332(c)(1)(B). A mobile service offers interconnected service even if the  service allows subscribers to access the public switched network only  during specified hours of the day, or if the service provides general  access to points on the public switched network but also restricts  access in certain limited ways. Interconnected service does not include  any interface between a licensee's facilities and the public switched  network exclusively for a licensee's internal control purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Location-capable handsets. Portable or mobile phones that contain  special location-determining hardware and/or software, which is used by  a licensee to locate 911 calls.</p><p class="depth0">Manual Roaming. With manual roaming, a subscriber must establish a  relationship with the host carrier on whose system he or she wants to  roam in order to make a call. Typically, the roaming subscriber  accomplishes this in the course of attempting to originate a call by  giving a valid credit card number to the carrier providing the roaming  service.</p><p class="depth0">Mobile Consumer Signal Booster.
