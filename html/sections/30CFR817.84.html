The stability of the structure  and the potential impact of acid mine seepage through the impounding  structure and shall be discussed in detail in the design plan submitted  to the regulatory authority in accordance with Sec. 780.25 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each impounding structure constructed of coal mine waste or  intended to impound coal mine waste shall be designed, constructed and  maintained in accordance with Sec. 817.49 (a) and (c). Such structures  may not be retained permanently as part of the approved postmining land  use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each impounding structure constructed of coal mine waste or  intended to impound coal mine waste that meets the criteria of Sec.  77.216(a) of this title shall have sufficient spillway capacity to  safely pass, adequate storage capacity to safely contain, or a  combination of storage capacity and spillway capacity to safely control,  the probable maximum precipitation of a 6-hour precipitation event, or  greater event as specified by the regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Spillways and outlet works shall be designed to provide adequate  protection against erosion and corrosion. Inlets shall be protected  against blockage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Drainage control. Runoff from areas above the disposal facility  or runoff from the surface of the facility that may cause instability or  erosion of the impounding structure shall be diverted into stabilized  diversion channels designed to meet the requirements of Sec. 817.43 and  designed to safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour design  precipitation event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Impounding structures constructed of or impounding coal mine  waste shall be designed so that at least 90 percent of the water stored  during the design precipitation event can be removed within a 10-day  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For an impounding structure constructed of or impounding coal  mine waste, at least 90 percent of the water stored during the design  precipitation event shall be removed within the 10-day period following  the design precipitation event.
