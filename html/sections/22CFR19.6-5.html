If the application is completed, the beneficiary is eligible and the court order appears on its face to be a qualifying order, PER/ER/RET will provide the notification required by Sec. 19.6-6, otherwise, it will notify the applicant of any deficiency or requirement for additional information, and if the order is determined to be non-qualifying, the basis for such determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final decree of divorce, PER/ER/RET will determine whether--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a valid decree. Any decree recognized as valid by the parties will be considered valid for this purpose. In addition, any non-recognized decree will be considered valid for this purpose unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> Neither party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Neither party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The party denying recognition did not participate in the proceedings, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The party denying recognition was not afforded notice of the proceedings (actual or constructive);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A related court order has been submitted by either party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A pro rata share payment is or may become due the former spouse. If a divorce decree is deemed valid under this paragraph, a pro rata share payment is due a former spouse unless PER/ER/RET is in receipt of a court order which it has deemed qualified under paragraph (a) of this section, or a valid spousal agrement providing otherwise. If it determines that a pro rata share payment is due, it will provide the notification required by Sec. 19.6-6, otherwise, unless action is being taken pursuant to a related court order, it will notify both parties to the

divorce the reason a pro rata share payment is not payable.
