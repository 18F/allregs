                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An importer who makes a claim for preferential tariff treatment under Sec. 10.1003(b) of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will be deemed to have certified that the good is eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the UKFTA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is responsible for the truthfulness of the claim and of all the information and data contained in the certification provided for in Sec. 10.1004 of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is responsible for submitting any supporting documents requested by CBP, and for the truthfulness of the information contained in those documents. When a certification prepared by an exporter or producer forms the basis of a claim for preferential tariff treatment, and CBP requests the submission of supporting documents, the importer will provide to CBP, or arrange for the direct submission by the exporter or producer of, all information relied on by the exporter or producer in preparing the certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information provided by exporter or producer. The fact that the importer has made a claim or submitted a certification based on information provided by an exporter or producer will not relieve the importer of the responsibility referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemption from penalties. An importer will not be subject to civil or administrative penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for making an incorrect claim for preferential tariff treatment or submitting an incorrect certification, provided that the importer promptly and voluntarily corrects the claim or certification and pays any duty owing (see Sec. Sec. 10.1031 and 10.1033 of this subpart).</p>
