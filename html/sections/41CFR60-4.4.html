                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To implement the affirmative action requirements of Executive  Order 11246 in the construction industry, the Office of Federal Contract  Compliance Programs previously has approved affirmative action programs  commonly referred to as ``Hometown Plans,'' has promulgated affirmative  action plans referred to as ``Imposed Plans'' and has approved ``Special  Bid Conditions'' for high impact projects constructed in areas not  covered by a Hometown or an Imposed Plan. All solicitations for  construction contracts made after the effective date of the regulations  in this part shall include the notice specified in Sec. 60-4.2 of this  part and the specifications in Sec. 60-4.3 of this part in lieu of the  Hometown and Imposed Plans including the Philadelphia Plan and Special  Bid Conditions. Until the Director has issued an order pursuant to Sec.  60-4.6 of this part establishing goals and timetables for minorities in  the appropriate geographical areas or for a project covered by Special  Bid Conditions, the goals and timetables for minorities to be inserted  in the Notice required by 41 CFR 60-4.2 shall be the goals and  timetables contained in the Hometown Plan, Imposed Plan or Special Bid  Conditions presently covering the respective geographical area or  project involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signatories to a Hometown Plan (including heavy highway  affirmative action plans) shall have 45 days from   the effective date of the regulations in this part to submit under such  a Plan (for the director's approval) goals and timetables for women and  to include female representation on the Hometown Plan Administrative  Committee. Such goals for female representation shall be at least as  high as the goals established for female representation in the notice  issued pursuant to 41 CFR 60-4.6. Failure of the signatories, within the  45-day period, to include female representation and to submit goals for  women or a new plan, as appropriate, shall result in an automatic  termination of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program's  approval of the Hometown Plan. At any time the Office of Federal  Contract Compliance Programs terminates or withdraws its approval of a  Hometown Plan, or when the plan expires and another plan is not  approved, the contractors signatory to the plan shall be covered  automatically by the specifications set forth in Sec. 60-4.3 of this  part and by the goals and timetables established for that geographical  area pursuant to Sec. 60-4.6 of this part.</p>
