All appeals to the Director, NACIC shall be in  writing and addressed as specified in Sec. 1801.3. All appeals must  identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with  specificity, provide the desired amending language (if applicable), and  may present such information, data, and argument in support as the  requester may desire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has  outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal  agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in  question has been the subject of an administrative review within the  previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the  federal courts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Receipt, recording, and tasking.
