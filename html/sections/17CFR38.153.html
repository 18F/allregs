Such arrangements must include  the authority to collect information and documents on both a routine and  non-routine basis, including the authority to examine books and records  kept by the designated contract market's members and by persons under  investigation. A designated contract market's arrangements and resources  must also facilitate the direct supervision of the market and the  analysis of data collected to determine whether a rule violation  occurred.</p>
