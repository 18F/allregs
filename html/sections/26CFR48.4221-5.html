                                Sec. 48.4221-5  Tax-free sale of articles to State and local governments

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em>, and, therefore, such sales may not be made tax free. Such  sales are not exempt regardless of whether the resales are   made to government employees, or the fact that the article is an item of  equipment the employee is required to possess in carrying out his  duties. For example, pistols or revolvers may not be sold tax free to a  State or local government for resale to its police officers. See section  6416(b)(2)(C), and paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 48.6416(b)-2, for the  circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where  tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a State or local  government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> State or local government. The term ``State or local  government'' includes any State, the District of Columbia, and any  political subdivision of any of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section, consist of a certificate, executed and  signed by an officer or employee authorized by the State or local  government to execute and sign the certificate. If it is impracticable  to furnish a separate certificate for each order or contract because of  a frequency of purchases, a certificate covering all orders between  given dates (such period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters) will be  acceptable. The certificates and proper records of invoices, orders,  etc., relative to tax-free sales must be retained by the manufacturer as  provided in section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. The certificate  shall be in substantially the following form:</p><p class="depth0">Exemption Certificate  (For use by States and local governments (section 4221(a)(4) of the  Internal Revenue Code))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Date)</em> --------------------------, 19----.</p><p class="depth0">I hereby certify that I am ------------------ (Title of Officer) of  ------------------ (State or local government) that I am authorized to  execute this certificate; and that:</p><p class="depth0">(Check applicable type of certificate)  ---- the article or articles specified in the accompanying order, or on  the reverse side hereof, (or)  ---- all orders placed by the purchaser for the period commencing ------ ------------ (Date) and ending ------------------ (Date) (period not to  exceed 12 calendar quarters), are, or will be, purchased from ---------- -------- (Name of manufacturer) for the exclusive use of -------------- ---- (Governmental unit) of ------------------ (State or local  government).</p><p class="depth0">I understand that the exemption from tax in the case of sales of  articles under this exemption certificate to a State, etc., is limited  to the sale of articles purchased for its exclusive use. I understand  that the fraudulent use of this certificate for the purpose of securing  this exemption will subject me and all parties making such fraudulent  use of this certificate to a fine of not more than $10,000, or to  imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, together with costs of  prosecution.  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Signature)</em> ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Address)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A purchase order, provided that all of the information required  by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is included therein, is acceptable  in lieu of a separate exemption certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Resale of articles purchased tax free by a State or local  government. If articles purchased tax free for the exclusive use of a  State or local government are prior to use by the State or local  government resold under circumstances that do not amount to an exclusive  use by the State or local government (such as tires that are resold by a  volunteer fire department to volunteer firemen), the parties responsible  in the State or local government are required to inform the  manufacturer, producer, or importer from whom the articles were  purchased that they were disposed of in a manner that did not amount to  an exclusive use by the State or local government. A willful failure to  supply the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the information  required by this subparagraph will subject responsible parties to the  penalties provided by section 7203.
