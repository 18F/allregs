purposes as prescribed in this section. The Director, Office of Administrative Services and heads of field organizations for their respective organizations shall establish appropriate controls to ensure that the use of a Government motor vehicle for transportation between an employee's residence and place of employment is in accordance with the provisions of 41 CFR part 102-5 and this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is DOE policy that space in a Government motor vehicle used for home-to-work transportation may be shared with a spouse, relative, or friend in accordance with the restrictions contained in 41 CFR 102-5.105.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Departmental official who is authorized home-to-work transportation is permitted to use Government-owned or leased motor vehicles for non-official purposes incidental to the official use of the vehicle, provided that the incremental cost (e.g., driver time and mileage) of such use is de minimis or such costs are outweighed by other considerations, such as the efficient use of the official's time.
