Such cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State or county, as determined by CCC. This means that the calculated 75 percent of the average cost may represent less than 75 percent of the actual cost for an individual participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as otherwise provided for in this part, a participant may receive, in addition to any payment under this part, establishment assistance, rental payments, or tax benefits from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in BCAP without a commensurate reduction in BCAP establishment payments.</p>
