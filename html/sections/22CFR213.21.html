                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section establishes USAID's policies and procedures for recovery of debts owed to the United States by installment collection from the current pay account of an employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed USAID and debts owed to other Federal agencies by USAID employees. USAID will make every effort reasonably and lawfully possible to administratively collect amounts owed by employees prior to initiating collection by salary offset. An amount advanced to an employee for per diem or mileage allowances in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, but not used for allowable travel expenses, is recoverable from the employee by salary offset without regard to the due process provisions in Sec. 213.22. This section does not apply to debts where collection by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> References.
