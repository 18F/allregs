                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Batch front-end process vents. The owner or operator of an affected source with a Group 1 batch front-end process vent, as determined using the procedures in Sec. 63.488, shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each batch front-end process vent, reduce organic HAP emissions using a flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of the affected sources shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.504(c) for the flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Halogenated batch front-end process vents, as defined in Sec. 63.482, shall not be vented to a flare.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each batch front-end process vent, reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 90 weight percent using a control device. Owners or operators may achieve compliance with this paragraph through the control of selected batch emission episodes or the control of portions of selected batch emission episodes. Documentation demonstrating how the 90 weight percent emission reduction is achieved is required by Sec. 63.490(c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aggregate batch vent streams. The owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream that contains one or more Group 1 batch front-end process vents shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each aggregate batch vent stream, reduce organic HAP emissions using a flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.504(c) for the flare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, as defined in Sec. 63.482, shall not be vented to a flare.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each aggregate batch vent stream, reduce organic HAP emissions by 90 weight percent or to a concentration of 20 ppmv, whichever is less stringent, on a continuous basis using a control device. For purposes of complying with the 20 ppmv outlet concentration standard, the outlet concentration shall be calculated on a dry basis. When a combustion device is used for purposes of complying with the 20 ppmv outlet concentration standard, the concentration shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen if supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions. If supplemental combustion air is not used, a correction to 3 percent oxygen is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Halogenated emissions. Halogenated Group 1 batch front-end process vents, halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, and halogenated continuous front-end process vents that are combusted as part of complying with paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, shall be controlled according to either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a combustion device is used to comply with paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section for a halogenated batch front-end process vent or halogenated aggregate batch vent stream, the emissions exiting the combustion device shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device that reduces overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens by at least 99 percent before discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A halogen reduction device may be used to reduce the halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 3,750 kg/yr for batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams and thus make the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream nonhalogenated. The nonhalogenated batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall then comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Combination of batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams with continuous front-end process vents. If a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream is combined with a continuous front-end process vent, the owner or operator shall determine whether the combined vent stream is subject to the provisions of Secs. 63.486 through 63.492 according to paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream combined with a continuous front-end process vent stream is not subject to the provisions of Secs. 63.486 through 63.492, if the

requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and in either paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(1)(iii) are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The only emissions to the atmosphere from the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream prior to being combined with the continuous front-end process vent are from equipment subject to Sec. 63.502.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The batch front-end vent stream or aggregate batch vent stream is combined with a Group 1 continuous front-end process vent stream prior to the combined vent stream being routed to a control device. In this paragraph (e)(1)(ii), the definition of control device as it relates to continuous front-end process vents shall be used. Furthermore, the combined vent stream discussed in this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) shall be subject to Sec. 63.485(o)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream is combined with a continuous front-end process vent stream prior to being routed to a recovery device. In this paragraph (e)(1)(iii), the definition of recovery device as it relates to continuous front-end process vents shall be used. Furthermore, the combined vent stream discussed in this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) shall be subject to Sec. 63.485(o)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream is combined with a Group 2 continuous front-end process vent, the group status of the batch front-end process vent shall be determined prior to its combination with the Group 2 continuous front-end process vent, in accordance with Sec. 63.488, and the combined vent stream shall be subject to the requirements for aggregate batch vent streams in Secs. 63.486 through 63.492.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Group 2 batch front-end process vents with annual emissions greater than or equal to the level specified in Sec. 63.488(d).
