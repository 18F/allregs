                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There must be no vibration or buffeting severe enough to result  in structural damage, and each part of the airplane must be free from  excessive vibration, under any appropriate speed and power conditions up  to VD/MD, or VDF/MDF for  turbojets. In addition, there must be no buffeting in any normal flight  condition, including configuration changes during cruise, severe enough  to interfere with the satisfactory control of the airplane or cause  excessive fatigue to the flight crew. Stall warning buffeting within  these limits is allowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There must be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise  configuration in straight flight at any speed   up to VMO/MMO, except stall buffeting, which is  allowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For airplanes with MD greater than M 0.6 or a maximum  operating altitude greater than 25,000 feet, the positive maneuvering  load factors at which the onset of perceptible buffeting occurs must be  determined with the airplane in the cruise configuration for the ranges  of airspeed or Mach number, weight, and altitude for which the airplane  is to be certificated. The envelopes of load factor, speed, altitude,  and weight must provide a sufficient range of speeds and load factors  for normal operations. Probable inadvertent excursions beyond the  boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes may not result in unsafe  conditions.  [Amdt. 23-62, 76 FR 75755, Dec. 2, 2011]</p>
