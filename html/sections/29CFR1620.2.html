                                Sec. 1620.2  General coverage of employees ``engaged in commerce.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Like the FLSA, the EPA applies to employees ``engaged in commerce.'' ``Commerce'' is broadly defined in section 3(b) of the FLSA. It includes both interstate and foreign commerce and is not limited to transportation across State lines, or to activity of a commercial character. All parts of the movement among the several States, or between any State and any place outside thereof, of persons or things, tangibles or intangibles, including communication of information and intelligence, constitute movement in ``commerce'' within the statutory definition. This includes those parts of any such activity which take place wholly within a single State. In addition, the instrumentalities for carrying on such commerce are so inseparable from the commerce itself that employees working on such instrumentalities within the

borders of a single State, by virtue of the contribution made by their work to the movement of the commerce, are ``engaged in commerce'' within the meaning of the FLSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with the purpose of the FLSA to apply Federal standards ``throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce,'' the courts have made it clear that the employees ``engaged in commerce'' include every employee employed in the channels of such commerce or in activities so closely related to such commerce as to be considered a part of it as a practical matter. Engaging ``in commerce'' includes activities connected therewith such as management and control of the various physical processes, together with the accompanying accounting and clerical activities. Thus, employees engaged in interstate or foreign commerce will typically include, among others, employees in distributing industries such as wholesaling or retailing who sell, transport, handle, or otherwise work on goods moving in interstate or foreign commerce as well as workers who order, receive, guard, pack, ship or keep records of such goods; employees who handle payroll or personnel functions for workers engaged in such activities; clerical and other workers who regularly use the mails, telephone, or telegraph for communication across State lines; and employees who regularly travel across State lines while working. For other examples, see 29 CFR part 776.</p>
