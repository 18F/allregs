Agricultural commodities also may be provided for non- emergency assistance through private voluntary organizations or  cooperatives which are, to the extent practicable, registered with  A.I.D., and through intergovernmental organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms and conditions. This part 211, also known as A.I.D.  Regulation 11, provides the standard terms and conditions applicable to  title II programs, except those conducted by agencies of the United  Nations and the World Food Program. The Operational Plan submitted by a  cooperating sponsor may propose, and justify, the waiver of any section  of this Regulation that is not required by statute. If A.I.D. approves a  waiver, the specific section or subsection waived will be identified in  the Transfer Authorization signed by the cooperating sponsor and A.I.D.  or in an attachment, prepared by A.I.D., that is appended to the  Operational Plan.</p>
