                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before surface mining operations may commence under any permit  or lease, the operator must file a mining plan with the mining  supervisor and obtain his approval of the plan. The mining supervisor  shall consult with the superintendent with respect to the surface  protection and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Depending on the size and nature of the operation and the  requirements established pursuant to Sec. 216.4 the mining supervisor  may require that the mining plan submitted by the operator include any  or all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the location and area to be affected by the  operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two copies of a suitable map, or aerial photograph showing the  topography, the area covered by the permit or lease, the name and  location of major topographic and cultural features, and the drainage  plan away from the area affected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of proposed methods of operating, including a  description of proposed roads or vehicular trails; the size and location  of structures and facilities to be built;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An estimate of the quantity of water to be used and pollutants  that are expected to enter any receiving waters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment or control of  all runoff water and drainage from workings so as to reduce soil erosion  and sedimentation and to prevent the pollution of receiving waters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control  fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to  fish and wildlife, and hazards to public health and safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A statement of the proposed manner and time of performance of  work to reclaim areas disturbed by the holder's operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In those instances in which the permit or lease requires the  revegetation of an area of land to be affected, the mining plan shall  show:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed methods of preparation and fertilizing the soil prior  to replanting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Types and mixtures of shrubs, trees, or tree seedlings, grasses  or legumes to be planted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Types and methods of planting, including the amount of grasses  or legumes per acre, or the number and spacing of trees, or tree  seedlings, or combinations of grasses and trees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In those instances in which the permit or lease requires  regrading and backfilling, the mining plan shall show the proposed  methods and the timing of grading and backfilling of areas of land to be  affected by the operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The mining supervisor shall review the mining plan submitted to  him by the operator and shall promptly indicate to the operator any  changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements  formulated pursuant to Sec. 216.4, the provisions of these regulations  and the terms of the permit or lease. The operator shall comply with the  provisions of an approved mining plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A mining plan may be changed by mutual consent of the mining  supervisor and the operator at any time to adjust to changed conditions  or to correct any oversight. To obtain approval of a change or  supplemental plan, the operator shall submit a written statement of the  proposed changes or supplement and the justification for the changes  proposed. The mining supervisor shall promptly notify the operator that  he consents to the proposed changes or supplement, or in the event he  does not consent, he shall specify the modifications thereto under which  the proposed changes or supplement would be acceptable. After mutual  acceptance of a change of a plan, the operator shall not depart  therefrom without further approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If circumstances warrant or if development of a mining plan for  the entire operation is dependent upon unknown factors which cannot or  will not be determined except during the progress of the operations, a  partial plan may be approved and supplemented from time to time. The  operator shall not, however, perform any operation except under an  approved plan.</p>
