                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You need to consider requirements for both periodic audits and award-specific audits (as defined in Sec. 37.1325 and Sec. 37.1235, respectively). The way that your expenditure-based TIA addresses the two types of audits will vary, depending upon the type of for-profit participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For for-profit participants that are audited by the DCAA or other Federal auditors, as described in Secs. 37.650(b) and 37.655, you need not add specific requirements for periodic audits because the Federal audits should be sufficient to address whatever may be needed.

Your inclusion in the TIA of the standard access-to-records provision for those for-profit participants, as discussed in Sec. 37.915(a), gives the necessary access in the event that you or administrative agreements officers later need to request audits to address award-specific issues that arise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each other for-profit participant, you:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Should require that the participant have an independent auditor (i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant) conduct periodic audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards. A prime reason for including this requirement is that the Federal Government, for an expenditure-based award, necessarily relies on amounts reported by the participant's systems when it sets payment amounts or adjusts performance outcomes. The periodic audit provides some assurance that the reported amounts are reliable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must ensure that the award provides an independent auditor the access needed for award-specific audits, to be performed at the request of the cognizant administrative agreements officer if issues arise that require audit support. However, consistent with the government-wide policies on single audits that apply to nonprofit participants (see Sec. 37.665), you should rely on periodic audits to the maximum extent possible to resolve any award-specific issues.</p>
