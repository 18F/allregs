time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time an employee becomes eligible to participate in the  SEP (whether at the creation of the SEP or thereafter) or up to 90 days  after the effective

IRAs, including restrictions that allow rollovers or  withdrawals but reduce earnings of the IRAs or impose other penalties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General information concerning SEPs and

rollover or transfer may be effected without causing adverse tax  consequences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement to the effect that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> IRAs other than the IRA(s) into which employer contributions  will be made under the SEP may provide different rates of return and may  have different terms concerning, among other things, transfers and  withdrawals of funds from the IRA(s),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event a participant is entitled to make a contribution  or rollover   to an IRA, such contribution or rollover can be made to an IRA other  than the one into which employer contributions under the SEP are to be  made, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Depending on the terms of the IRA into which employer  contributions are made, a participant may be able to make rollovers or  transfers of funds from that IRA to another IRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the disclosure required by the Internal Revenue  Service to be made to individuals for whose benefit an IRA is  established by the financial institution or other person who sponsors  the IRA(s) into which contributions will be made under
