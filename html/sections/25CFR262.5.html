                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permits from the BIA shall be issued when an applicant meets the  requirements set out in 43 CFR 7.8, and may be conditioned, modified,  suspended, or revoked by the Area Director. Area Directors may delegate  this authority to Agency Superintendents, but only on a permit-by-permit  basis and only to those who have adequate professional support  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prospective applicants may obtain details on how to apply for a  permit by contacting the Area Director, at BIA Area Offices in:  Aberdeen, SD; Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; Arlington, VA; Billings,  MT; Gallup, NM; Juneau, AK; Minneapolis, MN; Muskogee, OK; Phoenix, AZ;  Portland, OR; or Sacramento, CA; or by writing to the Deputy  Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington,  DC 20240.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permit applications proposing the excavation or removal of  archaeological resources on Indian lands shall include the following  consent documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written permission from the Indian landowner and from the tribe,  if any, having jurisdiction over those lands. This must contain such  terms and conditions as the landowner or tribe may request be included  in the permit. Where the permission is from a tribe, it should either  state that no religious or cultural site will be harmed or destroyed by  the proposed work or specify terms and conditions that the permit must  include in order to safeguard against such harm or destruction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For lands of Indian tribes, permission must be granted by the  tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For lands of Indian individuals not under tribal jurisdiction,  permission must be granted by the owner(s), except as provided in Sec.  262.6.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For lands of Indian individuals under tribal jurisdiction,  permission must be granted by both the owner(s), except as provided in  Sec. 262.6, and the tribe having such jurisdiction. Where an applicant  is the owner, consent must still be obtained from the tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Where the ownership of lands of Indian individuals is multiple,  permission must be granted by the owners of a majority of interests,  except as provided in Sec. 262.6. The same shall apply where the  applicant is one of the owners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where the terms and conditions a tribe or landowner requests be  included in a permit are in conflict with the provisions of this or any  other Act, with Federal regulations, or with each other, the Area  Director may negotiate with the requestor to eliminate the conflict. If  the conflict remains, the permit may not be issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Copies of any permits required by tribal law for archaeological  work on lands under tribal jurisdiction. This may serve as written  consent from the tribe for the purposes of Sec. 262.5(c)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written agreement by the Indian landowner(s) to release  archaeological resources for curation or study, as specified in Sec.  262.8(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permits issued by the BIA shall include the following or similar  condition: ``Human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects,  and objects of cultural patrimony may not be excavated or removed unless  the permittee has obtained the written consent of the Area Director. In  order to obtain consent, the permittee shall present to the Area  Director written evidence of prior consultation with the appropriate  Indian tribe. If the lands containing the remains or objects are tribal  lands, the permittee shall first obtain the written consent of the tribe  having jurisdiction over the lands.'' Determination as to which tribe is  the appropriate tribe shall be made in accordance with Sec. 262.8(a).  Area Director consent shall be based on the scientific appropriateness  of the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and  analysis and may, if documented, be oral. This condition may be omitted  from the permit when such excavation or removal is proposed, and the  requirements of the condition are met, in the permit application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information and assistance in contacting Indian tribes and  individual   Indian landowners for the purpose of requesting the consent documents  listed under paragraph (c) of this section or of seeking the  consultation and consent required under paragraph (d) of this section  may be obtained from the BIA office to which the permit application is  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contractual agreements with the BIA or Indian tribes and permits  issued by Indian tribes may be accepted as support documents for permit  applications. They may also double as permit documents, if they  demonstrate that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at  43 CFR part 7 have been met and they are attached to a Department of the  Interior permit form. This form must be signed by the Area Director, but  need only contain the following or similar statement: ``This permit is  issued to the person(s) named, and in accordance with the terms and  conditions in the attached (contractual agreement/tribal permit).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Area Directors shall respond to permit applications within 15  working days of receipt.</p>
