                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under Sec. 160.037-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any change in construction details,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any change in sources of raw materials, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into

construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this Chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.037-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defeats (Table 160.037-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If the sum is equal to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired, or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.037-4(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours. If the signal is protected by alternate waterproofing consisting of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic waterproof bag, the 24-hour water immersion conditioning will be conducted while the signal is in the sealed plastic waterproof bag and will be followed by an additional immersion of the bare signal (i.e., after removal from the bag) 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 10 minutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Waterproofing of igniter button. Remove the cap from the test specimen. Place head of specimen without cap about 25 mm (1 in.) under the surface of water for approximately 5 minutes. Remove specimen from the water and wipe dry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Smoke emitting time. Ignite specimen according to directions printed on the signal. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission until it ceases. The watch shall be

stopped during periods of flame emission. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall be not less than 50 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics. Test specimens shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. The plug separating the smoke producing composition from the handle shall in no case allow flame or hot gases to pass through it or between it and the casing in such manner as might burn the hand while holding the signal by the handle.</p><p class="depth4">Table 160.037-4(c)(1)--Accept and reject criteria for operational test lots----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Cumula-</p><p class="depth4">Individual                                tive   Accept  Reject</p><p class="depth4">Lot size                       sample              Sample             sample    \1\     \1\</p><p class="depth4">size                                   size----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------280 or                                                  8    First.....................        8   ( \2\     400</p><p class="depth4">)</p><p class="depth4">less.                                          ..........

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.011</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order for the lot of signals to be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Underwater smoke emission. Condition each sample in accordance with

paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it burn about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until smoke emission ceases. The test specimen shall burn underwater not less than 10 seconds when subjected to this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bending strength. Place the specimen on supports 15 cm (6 in.) apart. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by looping the wire around the signal approximately equidistant from the two points of support. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not deflect more than 7 mm (\1/4\ in.), nor shall the joint between the casing and the handle fail when subjected to this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tensile strength. Place the specimen in a chuck firmly holding it about 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) below the cap. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by looping the wire through a hole bored perpendicular to and through the axis of the handle. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not show noticeable distortion, nor shall the joint between the casing and handle fail, when subjected to this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Elevated temperature, humidity and storage. Place specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 [deg]C. with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove specimen and store at room temperature (20[deg] to 25 [deg]C.) with approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate satisfactorily following this conditioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 [deg]C. with not more than 10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Susceptibility to explosion. Remove smoke composition from signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6 commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not explode or ignite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Color of smoke. Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the smoke must be orange as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color Names Dictionary'' (colors 34-39 and 48-54).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Volume and density of smoke. The test specimen shall show less than 70 percent transmission for not less than 30 seconds when measured with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7\1/2\ in.), an optical system aperture of + 3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m\3\ per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be as described in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.</p>
