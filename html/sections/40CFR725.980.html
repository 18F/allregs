                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Selection of microorganisms. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with the  expedited process specified in this section, EPA will issue significant  new use notification requirements for each new microorganism that, after  MCAN review under subpart D of this part, becomes subject to a final  order issued under section 5(e) of the Act, except for an order that  prohibits manufacture and import of the microorganism, unless EPA  determines that significant new use notification requirements are not  needed for the microorganism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If EPA determines that significant new use notifications  requirements are not needed for a microorganism that is subject to a  final order issued under section 5(e) of the Act, EPA will issue a  notice in the Federal Register explaining why the significant new use  requirements are not needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The significant new use  notification and other specific requirements will be based on and be  consistent with the provisions included in the final order issued for  the microorganism under section 5(e) of the Act. EPA may also designate  additional activities as significant new uses which will be subject to  notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Significant new use requirements and other specific requirements  designated under this section will be listed in subpart M of this part.  For each microorganism, subpart M of this part will identify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The microorganism name.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The activities designated as significant new uses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other specific requirements applicable to the microorganism,  including recordkeeping requirements or any other requirements included  in the final section 5(e) order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for issuing significant new use rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Possible  processes. EPA will issue significant new use rules (SNURs) under this  section by one of the following three processes: direct final  rulemaking, interim final rulemaking, or notice and comment rulemaking.  EPA will use the direct final rulemaking process to issue significant  new use rules unless it determines that, in a particular case, one of  the other processes is more appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice in the Federal Register. Federal Register documents  issued to propose or establish significant new uses under this section  will contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The microorganism identity or, if its specific identity is  claimed confidential, an appropriate generic microorganism name and an  accession number assigned by EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The MCAN number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A summary of EPA's findings under section 5(e)(1)(A) of the  Act for the final order issued under section 5(e).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Designation of the significant new uses subject to, or proposed  to be subject to, notification and any other applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any modification of subpart L of this part applicable to the  specific microorganism and significant new uses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the Federal Register document establishes a final rule, or  notifies the public that a final rule will not be issued after public  comment has been received, the document will describe comments received  and EPA's response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct final rulemaking. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will use direct final  rulemaking to issue a significant new use rule, when specific  requirements will be based on and be consistent with the provisions  included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section  5(e) of the Act. EPA will issue a final rule in the Federal Register  following its decision to develop a significant new use rule under this  section for a specific new microorganism.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal Register document will state that, unless written  notice is   received by EPA within 30 days of publication that someone wishes to  submit adverse or critical comments, the rule will be effective 60 days  from the date of publication. The written notice of intent to submit  adverse or critical comments should state which SNUR(s) will be the  subject of the adverse or critical comments, if several SNURs are  established through the direct final rule. If notice is received within  30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, the  section(s) of the direct final rule containing the SNUR(s) for which a  notice of intent to comment was received will be withdrawn by EPA  issuing a document in the final rule section of the Federal Register,  and a proposal will be published in the proposed rule section of the  Federal Register. The proposal will establish a 30-day comment period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If EPA, having considered any timely comments submitted in  response to the proposal, decides to establish notification requirements  under this section, EPA will issue a final rule adding the microorganism  to subpart M of this part and designating the significant new uses  subject to notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interim final rulemaking. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will use the interim final  rulemaking procedure to issue a significant new use rule, when specific  requirements will be based on and be consistent with the provisions  included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section  5(e) of the Act. The Agency will issue an interim final rule in the  Federal Register following its decision to develop a significant new use  rule for a specific new microorganism. The document will state EPA's  reasons for using the interim final rulemaking procedure.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The significant new use rule will take effect on the date of  publication.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Persons will be given 30 days from the date of publication to  submit comments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interim final rules issued under this section shall cease to be  in effect 180 days after publication unless, within the 180-day period,  EPA issues a final rule in the Federal Register responding to any  written comments received during the 30-day comment period specified in  paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section and promulgating final  significant new use notification requirements and other requirements for  the microorganism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notice and comment rulemaking. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will use a notice and  comment procedure to issue a significant new use rule, when EPA is  designating additional activities which are not provisions included in  the final order issued for the microorganism under section 5(e) of the  Act as significant new uses which will be subject to notification. EPA  will issue a proposal in the Federal Register following its decision to  develop a significant new use rule under this section for a specific new  microorganism. Persons will be given 30 days to comment on whether EPA  should establish notification requirements for the microorganism under  this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If EPA, having considered any timely comments, decides to  establish notification requirements under this section, EPA will issue a  final rule adding the microorganism to subpart M of this part and  designating the significant new uses subject to notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schedule for issuing significant new use rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless EPA  determines that a significant new use rule should not be issued under  this section, EPA will issue a proposed rule, a direct final rule, or an  interim final rule within 180 days of receipt of a valid notice of  commencement under Sec. 725.190.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If EPA receives adverse or critical significant comments  following publication of a proposed or interim final rule, EPA will  either withdraw the rule or issue a final rule addressing the comments  received.</p>
