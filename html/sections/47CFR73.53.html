                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Antenna monitors shall be verified for compliance with the  technical requirements in this section. The procedure for verification  is specified in subpart J of part 2 of the FCC's rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An antenna monitor shall meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The monitor shall be designed to operate in the 535-1705 kHz  band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monitor shall be capable of indicating any phase difference  between two RF voltages of the same frequency over a range of from 0 to  360[deg].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The monitor shall be capable of indicating the relative  amplitude of two RF voltages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The device used to indicate phase differences shall indicate in  degrees, and shall be graduated in increments of 2[deg], or less. If a  digital indicator is provided, the smallest increment shall be 0.5[deg],  or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The device used to indicate relative amplitudes shall be  graduated in increments which are 1 percent, or less, of the full scale  value. If a digital indicator is provided, the smallest increment shall  be 0.1 percent, or less, of the full scale value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The monitor shall be equipped with means, if necessary, to  resolve ambiguities in indication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the monitor is provided with more than one RF input terminal  in addition to a reference input terminal, appropriate switching shall  be provided in the monitor so that the signal at each of these RF inputs  may be selected separately for comparison with the reference input  signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each RF input of the monitor shall provide a termination of such  characteristics that, when connected to a sampling line of an impedance  specified by the manufacturer the voltage reflection coefficient shall  be 3 percent or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The monitor, if intended for use by stations operating  directional antenna systems by remote control, shall be designed so that  the switching functions required by paragraph (b)(7) of this section may  be performed from a point external to the monitor, and phase and  amplitude indications be provided by external meters. The indications of  external meters furnished by the manufacturer shall meet the  specifications for accuracy and repeatability of the monitor itself, and  the   connection of these meters to the monitor, or of other indicating  instruments with electrical characteristics meeting the specifications  of the monitor manufacturer shall not affect adversely the performance  of the monitor in any respect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Complete and correct schematic diagrams and operating  instructions shall be retained by the party responsible for verification  of the equipment and submitted to the FCC upon request. For the purpose  of equipment authorization, these diagrams and instructions shall be  considered as part of the monitor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> When an RF signal of an amplitude within a range specified by  the manufacturer is applied to the reference RF input terminal of the  monitor, and another RF signal of the same frequency and of equal or  lower amplitude is applied to any other selected RF input terminal,  indications shall be provided meeting the following specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The accuracy with which any difference in the phases of the  applied signals is indicated shall be 1[deg], or  better, for signal amplitude ratios of from 2:1 to 1:1, and 2[deg], or better, for signal amplitude ratios in excess  of 2:1 and up to 5:1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The repeatability of indication of any difference in the phases  of the applied signals shall be 1[deg], or better.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The accuracy with which the relative amplitudes of the applied  signals is indicated, over a range in which the ratio of these  amplitudes is between 2:1 and 1:1, shall be 2  percent of the amplitude ratio, or better, and for amplitude ratios in  excess of 2:1 and up to 5:1, 5 percent of the  ratio, or better.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The repeatability of indication of the relative amplitudes of  the applied signals, over a range where the ratio of these amplitudes is  between 5:1 and 1:1, shall be 2 percent of the  amplitude ratio, or better.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The modulation of the RF signals by a sinusoidal wave of any  frequency between 100 and 10,000 Hz, at any amplitude up to 90 percent  shall cause no deviation in an indicated phase difference from its  value, as determined without modulation, greater than 0.5[deg].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The performance specifications set forth in paragraph (b)(11)  of this section, shall be met when the monitor is operated and tested  under the following conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After continuous operation for 1 hour, the monitor shall be  calibrated and adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's  instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monitor shall be subjected to variations in ambient  temperature between the limits of 10 and 40 [deg]C; external meters  furnished by the manufacturer will be subjected to variations between 15  and 30 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Powerline supply voltage shall be varied over a range of from  10 percent below to 10 percent above the rated supply voltage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amplitude of the reference signal shall be varied over the  operating range specified by the manufacturer, and in any case over a  range of maximum to minimum values of 3 to 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The amplitude of the comparison signal shall be varied from a  value which is 0.2 of the amplitude of the reference signal to a value  which is equal in amplitude to the reference signal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Accuracy shall be determined for the most adverse combination  of conditions set forth above.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Repeatability shall be determined as that which may be  achieved under the specified test conditions over a period of 7 days,  during which no calibration or adjustment of the instrument, subsequent  to the initial calibration, shall be made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The effects of modulation of the RF signal shall be  separately determined, and shall not be included in establishing values  for accuracy and repeatability.</p><p class="depth4">Note: In paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the requirement that  monitors be capable of operation in the 535-1705 kHz band shall apply  only to equipment manufactured after July 1, 1992. Use of a monitor in  the 1605-1705 kHz band which is not approved for such operation will be  permitted pending the general availability of 535-1705 kHz band monitors  if a manufacturer can demonstrate, in   the interim, that its monitor performs in accordance with the standards  in this section on these 10 channels.
