Upon the receipt of waivers from all parties to a proceeding, the FCC will decide whether the case is an appropriate one for determination without the presentation of oral testimony. If it is determined by the FCC that, notwithstanding the waivers, the presentation of oral testimony is necessary, the parties will be so notified and the case will be retained on the hearing docket. If the FCC concludes that the case can appropriately be decided without the presentation of oral testimony, the record will be considered as closed as of the date the waivers of all the parties were first on file with the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In all cases considered in accordance with this procedure, the FCC will decide the case on the basis of the information contained in the applications and in any other papers pertaining to the applicants or applications which are open to public inspection and which were on file with the FCC when the record was closed.

The waiver previously executed by the parties shall be considered in effect unless within 10 days of the service of such information the waiver is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any decision by the FCC rendered pursuant to this section will be in the nature of a final decision, unless otherwise ordered by the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> By agreeing to the waiver procedure prescribed in this section, no party shall be deemed to waive the right to petition for reconsideration or rehearing, or to appeal to the courts from any adverse final decision of the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The waiver provided for by this section shall be in the following form:</p><p class="depth2">Waiver
