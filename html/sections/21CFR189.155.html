                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monochloroacetic acid is the chemical chloroacetic acid, C2H3C1O2. It is a synthetic chemical not found in natural products, and has been proposed as a preservative in alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Monochloroacetic acid is permitted in food package adhesives with an accepted migration level up to 10 parts per billion (ppb) under Sec. 175.105 of this chapter. The official methods do not detect monochloroacetic acid at the 10 ppb level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Food containing any added or detectable level of monochloroacetic acid is deemed to be adulterated in violation of the act based upon trade correspondence dated December 29, 1941 (TC-377).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The analytical methods used for detecting monochloroacetic acid in food are in sections 20.067-20.072 of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference.
