                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> through (j). For vehicles equipped with  non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the canister must be  loaded using the method involving butane loading to breakthrough (see  Sec. 86.132-96(j)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Without the exhaust emission test. The Administrator may conduct  the canister preconditioning by purging the canister(s) with at least  1200 canister bed volumes of ambient air (with humidity controlled to  50[25 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air) maintained at a  nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm directly following the preconditioning  drive described in Sec. 86.132-96 (c) through (e). In this case, the  canister loading procedures and the vehicle driving procedures described  in Sec. 86.132-96 (f) through (j) and in paragraphs (c) through (d) of  this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 minute time  requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to time after  completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple refueling  canisters, each canister shall be purged separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> through (d) of  this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 minute time  requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to time after  completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple refueling  canisters, each canister shall be purged separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers may use the procedures described in this paragraph  (b) to demonstrate compliance with the seal test for vehicles with fuel  tanks exceeding 35 gallons nominal fuel tank capacity, and for any  incomplete vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Canister purging; integrated systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicles to be tested  for exhaust emissions only shall be processed according to Secs. 86.135- 94 through 86.137-96. Vehicles to be tested for refueling emissions  shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in Secs. 86.135-94  through 86.137-96, followed by the procedures outlined in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To provide additional opportunity for canister purge, conduct  additional driving on a dynamometer, within one hour of completion of  the hot start exhaust test, by operating the test vehicle through one  UDDS, a 2 minute idle, two NYCCs, another 2 minute idle, another UDDS,  then another 2 minute idle (see Sec. 86.115-78 and appendix I of this  part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission  in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial  vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be  operated according to the specifications of Sec. 86.128-79 during the  driving cycles. The vehicle's air conditioner (if so equipped) shall be  turned off. Ambient temperature shall   be controlled as specified in Sec. 86.151-98. It is not necessary to  monitor and/or control in-tank fuel temperatures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fixed-speed fan specified in Sec. 86.135-94(b) may be used  for engine cooling. If a fixed-speed fan is used, the vehicle's hood  shall be opened.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternatively, the roadspeed-modulated fan specified in  Sec. 86.107-96(d)(1) may be used for engine cooling. If a road-speed  modulated fan is used, the vehicle's hood shall be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em> of this section. For vehicles equipped  with dual fuel tanks, the required volume of fuel shall be driven out of  one tank, the second tank shall be selected as the fuel source, and the  required volume of fuel shall be driven out of the second tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chassis dynamometer procedure. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle driving on a chassis  dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85  percent of fuel tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing  performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent of the  fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not  terminated partway through a UDDS cycle. Driving in testing performed by  the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles  as driven in the manufacturer's certification testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the  number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank fuel capacity  (total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual  fuel tanks) shall be determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS  applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the  nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank  volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a UDDS  cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching  from the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent  volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at  which this occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be  turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer. The vehicle may be  parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if  required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be  positioned as described in Sec. 86.135-94(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test track procedure. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle driving on a test track shall  consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel tank  capacity has been consumed. Driving performed by manufacturers may be  terminated before 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity has been  consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS  cycle. Driving performed by the Administrator may be terminated after  the same number of UDDS cycles as driven in the manufacturer's  certification testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the distance from the emission laboratory to the test track  is less than 5 miles (8.05 km) the vehicle may be driven to the test  track at a speed not to exceed 25 mph. If the distance is greater than 5  miles (8.05 km) the vehicle shall be moved to the test track with the  engine off.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the  number of UDDSs required to consume 85   percent of tank fuel capacity (total capacity of both tanks when the  vehicle is equipped with dual fuel tanks) shall be determined from the  fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle and from the  number of gallons to the nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that  constitutes 85 percent of tank volume. If this ``fuel consumed point''  occurs partway through a UDDS cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its  entirety.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The vehicle shall be driven at a speed not to exceed 25 mph  from the test track to the laboratory provided the distance from the  test track to the laboratory does not exceed 5 miles (8.05 km). If the  distance from the test track to the emission laboratory is greater than  5 miles (8.05 km) the vehicle shall be moved from the test track with  the engine off.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from  the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent volume  of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which  this occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be  turned off and the vehicle parked on the test track. The vehicle may be  parked off of the test track to facilitate maintenance or repairs if  required. If the vehicle is moved from the test track, it shall be  returned to the track with the engine off when mileage accumulation is  to be resumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drive schedule for partial refueling test. The Administrator may  conduct a partial refueling test involving a shortening of the drive  procedures described in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section and a  modified soak and refueling procedure as described in paragraph (e) of  this section and Sec. 86.154-98(e)(7)(i). The drive shall be performed  as described in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section except that the  drive shall be terminated when at least 10 percent but no more than 85  percent of the fuel tank nominal capacity has been consumed and not  partway through a UDDS cycle. The amount of fuel consumed in the drive  shall be determined by multiplying the number of UDDSs driven by the  mileage accumulated per UDDS and dividing by the fuel economy for the  UDDS applicable to the test vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vehicle cool down--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partial refueling test. If the  Administrator is conducting the non-integrated system partial refueling  test, after the driving procedure specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section, the vehicle shall be parked (without starting the engine) and  soaked at 80[3 F (27[1.7 C) for a minimum of 1 hour and a maximum of 6  hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other refueling emission tests. Within 10 minutes of  completion of refueling emissions canister stabilization (see paragraph  (c) or (d) of this section), the refueling emissions canister(s) shall  be disconnected, unless the manufacturer specifies that the refueling  canister(s) should not be disconnected. Within 60 minutes of completion  of refueling emissions canister stabilization (see paragraph (c) or (d)  of this section), the vehicle fuel tank(s) shall be drained, the fuel  tank(s) fueled to 10 percent of nominal tank capacity determined to the  nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter) with the specified fuel,  and the vehicle parked (without starting the engine) and soaked at 80[3  F (27[1.7 C) for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 24 hours.
