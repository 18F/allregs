                                Sec. 2640.201  Exemptions for interests in mutual funds, unit investment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Diversified mutual funds and unit investment trusts. An employee  may participate in any particular matter affecting one or more holdings  of a diversified mutual fund or a diversified unit investment trust  where the disqualifying financial interest in the matter arises because  of the ownership of an interest in the fund or trust.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 to paragraph (a): An employee owns shares worth $100,000  in several mutual funds whose portfolios contain stock in a small  computer company. Each mutual fund prospectus describes the fund as a  ``management company,'' but does not characterize the fund as having a  policy of concentrating its investments in any particular industry,  business, single country (other than the U.S.) or bonds of a single  State. The employee may participate in agency matters affecting the  computer company.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2 to paragraph (a): A nonsupervisory employee of the  Department of Energy owns shares valued at $75,000 in a mutual fund that  expressly concentrates its holdings in the stock of utility companies.  The employee may not rely on the exemption in paragraph (a) of this  section to act in matters affecting a utility company whose stock is a  part of the mutual fund's portfolio because the fund is not a  diversified fund as defined in Sec. 2640.102(a). The employee may,  however, seek an individual waiver under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) permitting  him to act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sector mutual funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee may participate in any  particular matter affecting one or more holdings of a sector mutual fund  or a sector unit investment trust where the affected holding is not  invested in the sector in which the fund or trust concentrates, and  where the disqualifying financial interest in the matter arises because  of ownership of an interest in the fund or unit investment trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An employee may participate in a particular matter affecting  one or more holdings of a sector mutual fund or a sector unit investment  trust where the disqualifying financial interest in the matter arises  because of ownership of an interest in the fund or the unit investment  trust and the aggregate market value of interests in any sector fund or  funds and any sector unit investment trust or trusts does not exceed  $50,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of calculating the $50,000 de minimis amount in  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, an employee must aggregate the  market value of all sector mutual funds and sector unit investment  trusts in which he has a disqualifying financial interest and that  concentrate in the same sector and have one or more holdings that may be  affected by the particular matter.</p><p class="depth4">Example 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Federal Reserve owns  shares in the mutual fund described in the preceding example. In  addition to holdings in utility companies, the mutual fund contains  stock in certain regional banks and bank holding companies whose  financial interests would be affected by an investigation in which the  Federal Reserve employee would participate. The employee is not  disqualified from participating in the investigation because the banks  that would be affected are not part of the sector in which the fund  concentrates.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2 to paragraph (b): A health scientist administrator  employed in the Public Health Service at the Department of Health and  Human Services is assigned to serve on a Departmentwide task force that  will recommend changes in how Medicare reimbursements will be made to  health care providers. The employee owns $35,000 worth of shares in the  XYZ Health Sciences Fund, a sector mutual fund invested primarily in  health-related companies such as pharmaceuticals, developers of medical  instruments and devices, managed care health organizations, and acute  care hospitals. The health   scientist administrator may participate in the recommendations.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3 to paragraph (b): The spouse of the employee in the  previous Example owns $40,000 worth of shares in ABC Specialized  Portfolios: Healthcare, a sector mutual fund that also concentrates its  investments in health-related companies. The two funds focus on the same  sector and both contain holdings that may be affected by the particular  matter. Because the aggregated value of the two funds exceeds $50,000,  the employee may not rely on the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employee benefit plans. An employee may participate in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any particular matter affecting one or more holdings of an  employee benefit plan, where the disqualifying financial interest in the  matter arises from membership in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees described in 5  U.S.C. 8437;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A pension plan established or maintained by a State government  or any political subdivision of a State government for its employees; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A diversified employee benefit plan, provided:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The investments of the plan are administered by an independent  trustee, and the employee, or other person specified in section 208(a)  does not participate in the selection of the plan's investments or  designate specific plan investments (except for directing that  contributions be divided among several different categories of  investments, such as stocks, bonds or mutual funds, which are available  to plan participants); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The plan is not a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan.</p><p class="depth5">Note to paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth5">Employee benefit plans that are tax deferred under 26 U.S.C. 401(k)  are not considered profit-sharing plans for purposes of this section.  However, for the exemption to apply, 401(k) plans must meet the  requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particular matters of general applicability, such as rulemaking,  affecting the State or local government sponsor of a State or local  government pension plan described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section where the disqualifying financial interest in the matter arises  because of participation in the plan.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: An attorney terminates his position with a law firm to  take a position with the Department of Justice. As a result of his  employment with the firm, the employee has interests in a 401(k) plan,  the assets of which are invested primarily in stocks chosen by an  independent financial management firm. He also participates in a defined  contribution pension plan maintained by the firm, the assets of which  are stocks, bonds, and financial instruments. The plan is managed by an  independent trustee. Assuming that the manager of the pension plan has a  written policy of diversifying plan investments, the employee may act in  matters affecting the plan's holdings. The employee may also participate  in matters affecting the holdings of his 401(k) plan if the individual  financial management firm that selects the plan's investments has a  written policy of diversifying the plan's assets. Employee benefit plans  that are tax deferred under 26 U.S.C. 401(k) are not considered profit- sharing or stock bonus plans for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2: An employee of the Department of Agriculture who is a  former New York State employee has a vested interest in a pension plan  established by the State of New York for its employees. She may  participate in an agency matter that would affect a company whose stock  is in the pension plan's portfolio. She also may participate in a matter  of general applicability affecting all States, including the State of  New York, such as the drafting and promulgation of a rule requiring  States to expend additional resources implementing the Food Stamp  program. Unless she obtains an individual waiver under 18 U.S.C.  208(b)(1), she may not participate in a matter involving the State of  New York as a party, such as an application by the State for additional  Federal funding for administrative support services, if that matter  would affect the State's ability or willingness to honor its obligation  to pay her pension benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Matters affecting mutual funds and unit investment trusts. In  addition to participation in the particular matters affecting the  holdings of mutual funds and unit investment trusts as permitted under  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an employee may participate in  any particular matter of general applicability affecting a mutual fund  or unit investment trust where the disqualifying financial interest  arises because of the ownership of an   interest in the mutual fund or unit investment trust.
