                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. Part 7 of the Office of the Secretary regulations,  Public Availability of Information, governs the availability of records  and documents of the Department to the public. (49 CFR 7.1 et seq.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information contained in written documents. Any person who  objects to the public disclosure of any information filed in any  proceeding, or pursuant to the provisions of the Statute, or any  Department rule, regulation, or order, shall segregate, or request the  segregation of, such information into a separate submission and shall  file it separately in a sealed envelope, bearing the caption of the  enclosed submission, and the notation ``Confidential Treatment Requested  Under Sec. 302.12.'' At the time of filing such submission (or, when  the objection is made by a person who is not the filer, within five (5)  days after the filing of such submission), the objecting party shall  file a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure, in  accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) or (f) of this  section, as appropriate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this  section, copies of the filed submission and of the motion need not be  served upon any other party unless so ordered by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information contained in oral testimony. Any person who objects  to the public disclosure of any information sought to be elicited from a  witness or deponent on oral examination shall, before such information  is disclosed, make his or her objection known. Upon such objection duly  made, the witness or deponent shall be compelled to disclose such  information only in the presence of the administrative law judge or the  person before whom the deposition is being taken, as the case may be,  the official stenographer and such attorneys for and representative of  each party as the administrative law judge or the person before whom the  deposition is being taken shall designate, and after all present have  been sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony containing such  information shall be segregated and filed in a sealed envelope, bearing  the title and docket number of the proceeding, and the notation  ``Confidential Treatment Requested Under Sec. 302.12 Testimony Given by  (name of witness or deponent).'' Within five (5) days after such  testimony is given, the objecting person shall file a motion in  accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) of this section,  to withhold the information from public disclosure. Notwithstanding any  other provision of this section, copies of the segregated portion of the  transcript and of the motion need not be served upon any other party  unless so ordered by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form of motion. Motions to withhold from public disclosure  information covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be  filed with the Department in accordance with the following procedure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The motion shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An index listing the information or document sought to be  withheld by an identifying number, and including its title, description  and number of pages, and, if relevant, the specific location within a  document;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement explaining how and why the information falls within  one or more of the exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act (5  U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement explaining how and why public disclosure of the  information would adversely affect the interests of the objecting  persons and is not required in the interest of the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such motion shall be filed with the person conducting the  proceeding, or with the person with whom said application, report, or  submission is required to be filed. Such motion will be denied when the  complete justification required by this paragraph is not provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the pendency of such motion, the ruling official may, by  notice or order, allow limited disclosure to parties' representatives,  for purposes of participating in the proceeding, upon submission by them  of affidavits swearing to protect the confidentiality of the documents  at issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions of disclosure. The order, notice or other action of  the Department containing its ruling upon each such motion will specify  the extent to which, and the conditions upon which, the information may  be disclosed to the parties and to the public, which ruling shall become  effective upon the date stated therein, unless, within five (5) days  after the date of the entry of the Department's order with respect  thereto, a petition is filed by the objecting person requesting  reconsideration by the Department, or a written statement is filed  indicating that the objecting person in good faith intends to seek  judicial review of the Department's order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Objection by Government departments or representative thereof.  In the case of objection to the public disclosure of any information  filed by or elicited from any United States Government department or  agency, or representative thereof, under paragraph (b) or (c) of this  section, the department or agency making such objection shall be  exempted from the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this  section insofar as said paragraphs require the filing of a written  objection to such disclosure. However, any department, agency, or  representative thereof may, if it so desires, file a memorandum setting  forth the reasons why it is claimed that a public disclosure of the  information should not be made. If such a memorandum is submitted, it  shall be filed and handled as is provided by this section in the case of  a motion to withhold information from public disclosure.</p>
