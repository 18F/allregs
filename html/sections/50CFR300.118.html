                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the facilitation of enforcement provisions of Sec. 300.5, the following requirements apply to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Access and records. (1) The owners and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors access to all spaces where work is conducted or business papers and records are prepared or stored, including but not limited to personal quarters and areas within personal quarters. If inspection of a particular area would interfere with specific on-going scientific research, and if the operator of the harvesting vessel makes such assertion and produces an individual permit that covers that specific research, the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector will not disturb the area, but will record the information pertaining to the denial of access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owners and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors access to all spaces where work is conducted or business papers and records are prepared or stored, including but not limited to personal quarters and areas within personal quarters. If inspection of a particular area would interfere with specific on-going scientific research, and if the operator of the harvesting vessel makes such assertion and produces an individual permit that covers that specific research, the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector will not disturb the area, but will record the information pertaining to the denial of access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide to authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors all records and documents pertaining to the harvesting activities of the vessel, including but not limited to production records, fishing logs, navigation logs, transfer records, product receipts, cargo stowage plans or records, draft or displacement calculations, customs documents or records, and an accurate hold plan reflecting the current structure of the vessel's storage and factory spaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before leaving vessels that have been inspected, the CCAMLR inspector will give the master of the vessel a Certificate of Inspection and a written notification of any alleged violations of Commission measures in effect and will afford the master the opportunity to comment on it. The ship's master must sign the notification to acknowledge receipt and the opportunity to comment on it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports by non-inspectors. All scientists, fishermen, and other non-inspectors present in the Convention area and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are encouraged to report any violation of Commission conservation and management measures observed in the Convention area to the Office of Ocean Affairs (CCAMLR Violations), Department of State, Room 5801, Washington, DC 20520.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storage of AMLRs. The operator of each harvesting vessel storing AMLRs in a storage space on board the vessel must ensure that non-resource items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by resource items, unless required to maintain the stability and safety of the vessel. Non-resource items include, but are not limited to, portable conveyors, exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, or other moveable non-resource items. These non-resource items may be in a resource storage space when necessary for the safety of the vessel or crew or for the storage of the items. Lumber, bin boards, or other dunnage may be used for shoring or bracing of product to ensure the safety of crew and to prevent shifting of cargo within the space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition of resources denied entry.
