                            <p class="depth0">You are subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart if you are the owner or operator of one or more of the onshore affected facilities listed in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which you commence construction, modification or reconstruction after August 23, 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each gas well affected facility, which is a single natural gas well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each centrifugal compressor affected facility, which is a single centrifugal compressor using wet seals that is located between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage

segment. A centrifugal compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each reciprocating compressor affected facility, which is a single reciprocating compressor located between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage segment. A reciprocating compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> For the oil production segment (between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to an oil pipeline), each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the oil production segment (between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to an oil pipeline), each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the natural gas production segment (between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage segment and not including natural gas processing plants), each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For natural gas processing plants, each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each storage vessel affected facility, which is a single storage vessel located in the oil and natural gas production segment, natural gas processing segment or natural gas transmission and storage segment, and has the potential for VOC emissions equal to or greater than 6 tpy as determined according to this section by October 15, 2013 for Group 1 storage vessels and by April 15, 2014, or 30 days after startup (whichever is later) for Group 2 storage vessels, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section. The potential for VOC emissions must be calculated using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology, based on the maximum average daily throughput determined for a 30-day period of production prior to the applicable emission determination deadline specified in this section. The determination may take into account requirements under a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under a Federal, State, local or tribal authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each new, modified or reconstructed storage vessel receiving liquids pursuant to the standards for gas well affected facilities in Sec. 60.5375, including wells subject to Sec. 60.5375(f), you must determine the potential for VOC emissions within 30 days after startup of production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A storage vessel affected facility that subsequently has its potential for VOC emissions decrease to less than 6 tpy shall remain an affected facility under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For storage vessels not subject to a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under Federal, state, local or tribal authority, any vapor from the storage vessel that is recovered and routed to a process through a VRU designed and operated as specified in this section is not required to be included in the determination of VOC potential to emit for purposes of determining affected facility status, provided you comply with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You meet the cover requirements specified in Sec. 60.5411(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You meet the closed vent system requirements specified in Sec. 60.5411(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You maintain records that document compliance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the event of removal of apparatus that recovers and routes vapor to a process, or operation that is inconsistent with the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, you must determine the storage vessel's potential for VOC emissions according to this section within 30 days of such removal or operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each new, reconstructed, or modified storage vessel with startup, startup of production, or which is returned to service, affected facility status is determined as follows: If a storage vessel is reconnected to the original source of liquids; used to replace

any storage vessel affected facility; or is installed in parallel with any storage vessel affected facility, it is a storage vessel affected facility subject to the same requirements as before being removed from service, or applicable to the storage vessel affected facility being replaced, or with which it is installed in parallel immediately upon startup, startup of production, or return to service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The group of all equipment, except compressors, within a process unit is an affected facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Addition or replacement of equipment for the purpose of process improvement that is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall not by itself be considered a modification under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment associated with a compressor station, dehydration unit, sweetening unit, underground storage vessel, field gas gathering system, or liquefied natural gas unit is covered by Sec. Sec. 60.5400, 60.5401, 60.5402, 60.5421, and 60.5422 of this subpart if it is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant.

For purposes of this provision, the dates specified in Sec. 60.5375(a) do not apply, and such facilities, as of October 15, 2012, must meet the requirements of Sec. 60.5375(a)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A well completion operation following hydraulic refracturing at a gas well facility not conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.5375 is a modification to the gas well affected facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refracturing of a gas well facility does not affect the modification status of other equipment, process units, storage vessels, compressors, or pneumatic controllers located at the well site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A gas well facility initially constructed after August 23, 2011, is considered an affected facility regardless of this provision.
