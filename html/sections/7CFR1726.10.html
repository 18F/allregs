Unless prior written approval is received from RUS, borrowers are required to comply with RUS policies and procedures as a condition to RUS providing loans, loan guarantees, or reimbursement of general funds for the construction and improvement of electric facilities. Requirements relating to RUS approval of plans and specifications, duties and responsibilities of the engineer and architect, and engineering and architectural services contracts, are contained in other RUS regulations. The terms ``RUS form'', ``RUS standard form'', ``RUS specification'', ``and RUS bulletin'' have the same meanings as the terms ``REA form'', ``REA standard form'', ``REA specification'', ``and REA bulletin'', respectively, unless otherwise noted.</p>
