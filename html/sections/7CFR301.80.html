Sec.  301.80-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of,regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exemptarticles from certification, permit, or other requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a supplemental regulation designated as Sec.  301.80-2a, each quarantined State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in Sec.  301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of witchweed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in Sec.  301.80-2a if a basis then exists for their designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation designated as Sec.  301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in the movement of such regulated articles

which make it safe to so relieve such requirements.
