                                Sec.  1065.125  Engine intake air.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the intake-air system installed on the engine or one that  represents a typical in-use configuration. This includes the charge-air  cooling and exhaust gas recirculation systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure near the  entrance of the furthest upstream engine or in-use intake system  component. This would generally be near the engine's air filter, or near  the inlet to the in-use air intake system for engines that have no air  filter. For engines with multiple intakes, make measurements near the  entrance of each intake.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pressure. You may use a single shared atmospheric pressure meter  as long as your laboratory equipment for handling intake air maintains  ambient pressure at all intakes within 1 kPa of  the shared atmospheric pressure. For engines with multiple intakes with  separate atmospheric pressure measurements at each intake, use an  average value for verifying compliance to Sec.  1065.520(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidity. You may use a single shared humidity measurement for  intake air as long as your equipment for handling intake air maintains  dewpoint at all intakes to within 0.5 [deg]C of  the shared humidity measurement. For engines with multiple intakes with  separate humidity measurements at each intake, use a flow-weighted  average humidity for NOX corrections. If individual flows of  each intake are not measured, use good engineering judgment to estimate  a flow-weighted average humidity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Temperature. Good engineering judgment may require that you  shield the temperature sensors or move them upstream of an elbow in the  laboratory intake system to prevent measurement errors due to radiant  heating from hot engine surfaces or in-use intake system components. You  must limit the distance between the temperature sensor and the entrance  to the furthest upstream engine or in-use intake system component to no  more than 12 times the outer hydraulic diameter of the entrance to the  furthest upstream engine or in-use intake system component. However, you  may exceed this limit if you use good engineering judgment to show that  the temperature at the furthest upstream engine or in-use intake system  component meets the specification in paragraph (c) of this section. For  engines with multiple intakes, use a flow-weighted average value to  verify compliance with the specification in paragraph (c) of this  section. If individual flows of each intake are not measured, you may  use good engineering judgment to estimate a flow-weighted average  temperature. You may also verify that each individual intake complies  with the specification in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintain the temperature of intake air to (25 5) [deg]C, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow the standard-setting part if it specifies different  temperatures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines above 560 kW, you may use 35 [deg]C as the upper  bound of the tolerance. However, your system must be capable of  controlling the temperature to the 25 [deg]C setpoint for any   steady-state operation at 30% of maximum engine power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may ask us to allow you to apply a different setpoint for  intake air temperature if it is necessary to remain consistent with the  provisions of Sec.  1065.10(c)(1) for testing during which ambient  temperature will be outside this range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use an intake-air restriction that represents production  engines. Make sure the intake-air restriction is between the  manufacturer's specified maximum for a clean filter and the  manufacturer's specified maximum allowed. Measure the static  differential pressure of the restriction at the location and at the  speed and torque set points specified by the manufacturer. If the  manufacturer does not specify a location, measure this pressure upstream  of any turbocharger or exhaust gas recirculation system connection to  the intake air system. If the manufacturer does not specify speed and  torque points, measure this pressure while the engine outputs maximum  power. As the manufacturer, you are liable for emission compliance for  all values up to the maximum restriction you specify for a particular  engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use a charge-air cooling system with a total intake-air capacity  that represents production engines' in-use installation. Design any  laboratory charge-air cooling system to minimize accumulation of  condensate. Drain any accumulated condensate. Before starting a duty  cycle (or preconditioning for a duty cycle), completely close all drains  that would normally be closed during in-use operation. Keep those drains  closed during the emission test. Maintain coolant conditions as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintain a coolant temperature of at least 20 [deg]C at the  inlet to the charge-air cooler throughout testing. We recommend  maintaining a coolant temperature of 25 5 [deg]C  at the inlet of the charge-air cooler.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the engine conditions specified by the manufacturer, set the  coolant flow rate to achieve an air temperature within 5 [deg]C of the value specified by the manufacturer  after the charge-air cooler's outlet. Measure the air-outlet temperature  at the location specified by the manufacturer. Use this coolant flow  rate set point throughout testing. If the engine manufacturer does not  specify engine conditions or the corresponding charge-air cooler air  outlet temperature, set the coolant flow rate at maximum engine power to  achieve a charge-air cooler air outlet temperature that represents in- use operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the engine manufacturer specifies pressure-drop limits  across the charge-air cooling system, ensure that the pressure drop  across the charge-air cooling system at engine conditions specified by  the manufacturer is within the manufacturer's specified limit(s).  Measure the pressure drop at the manufacturer's specified locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> apply instead of the  provisions of Sec.  1065.10(c)(1) for this simulation. Our allowance to  cool intake air as specified in this paragraph (e) does not affect your  liability for field testing or for laboratory testing that is done in a  way that better represents in-use operation. Where we determine that  this allowance adversely affects your ability to demonstrate that your  engines would comply with emission standards under in-use conditions, we  may require you to use more sophisticated setpoints and controls of  charge-air pressure drop, coolant temperature, and flow rate to achieve  more representative results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This approach does not apply for field testing. You may not  correct measured emission levels from field testing to account for any  differences caused by the simulated cooling in the laboratory.
