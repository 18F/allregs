                            <p class="depth0">This subpart prescribes actions to be executed by, or at the direction of, Navy Department (as defined in Sec. 700.104c of this chapter) components and specified headquarters activities for apprising members of the public of Department of the Navy regulations, policies, substantive and procedural rules, and decisions which may affect them, and for enabling members of the public to participate in Department of the Navy rulemaking processes in matters of substantial and direct concern to the public. This subpart complements subpart A, which implements Navy-wide requirements for furnishing documents to members of the public upon request. That a document may be published or indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under this instruction does not affect the possible requirement under subpart A for producing it for examination, or furnishing a copy, in response to a request made under that subpart.</p>
