The parties whose  property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive  Order 13382 are identified by the Department of the Treasury, Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V with the  bracketed suffix [NPWMD].

If OFAC  authorizes an export from the United States or an export or reexport by  a U.S. person to a party listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V with  the bracketed suffix [NPWMD], such authorization constitutes  authorization for purposes of the EAR as well.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or  reexport to a party listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V with the  bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR that is not  subject to OFAC's regulatory authority pursuant to Executive Order  13382.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for any  export from abroad or reexport to a party listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR  Chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the  EAR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any export or reexport to a party listed in Appendix A to 31  CFR Chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to  the EAR and not authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any export or reexport by a U.S. person to a party listed in  Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any  item subject to the EAR that is not subject to regulation by OFAC and  not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad  or reexport by a non-U.S. person to a party listed in Appendix A to 31  CFR Chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to  the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Relation to other EAR license requirements.
