To ensure the sufficient  information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her  bid all description material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or  other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to: (i)  determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics  requirements of the invitation for bids, and (ii) established exactly  what the bidder proposed to furnish and what the Government would be  binding itself to purchase by making an award.
