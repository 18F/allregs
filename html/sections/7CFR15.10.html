                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Decision by hearing officer or Secretary. (1) The hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings, and proposed decision to the Secretary for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. The applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the Secretary his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of exceptions, the Secretary may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the Secretary shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Decisions on record or review. Whenever a record is certified to the Secretary for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a), the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Secretary shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to Sec.  15.9(a), a decision shall be made by the Secretary on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to the regulations in this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Decision by Secretary. The Secretary shall make any final decision which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under the regulations in this part or the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and the regulations in this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to the regulations in this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with the regulations in this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Agency that it will fully comply with the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibilty to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply therewith. An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with Sec.  15.4 (a), (b), or (d) shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it complies with the requirements of a Sec.  15.4(e) and is otherwise in compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered

pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Secretary determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure set forth in subpart C of this part. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing, that it has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
