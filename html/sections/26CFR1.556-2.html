                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taxes--(1) General rule. (i) In computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income for any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a deduction the Federal income and excess profits taxes accrued during the taxable year except that no deduction shall be allowed for (a) the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531 (or a corresponding section of a prior law), (b) the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or a corresponding section of a prior law), and (c) the excess profits tax imposed by subchapter E, chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1940. The deduction is for taxes for the taxable year determined under the accrual method of accounting, regardless of whether the corporation uses an accrual method of accounting, the cash receipts and disbursements method, or any other allowable method of accounting. In computing the amount of taxes accrued, an unpaid tax which is being contested is not considered accrued until the contest is resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

(i) If the corporation was subject to supplement P, subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and, for the purpose of computing undistributed supplement P net income under such Code, deducted Federal taxes paid, rather than such taxes accrued, for each taxable year for which it was subject to supplement P of the 1939 Code, the corporation may elect for any taxable year ending after August 16, 1954, to deduct taxes accrued, rather than taxes paid, for the purpose of computing its undistributed foreign personal holding company income. The election shall be made by deducting such taxes accrued in the return (Form 958) required to be filed for such taxable year. The return shall, in addition, contain a statement that the corporation has made such election and shall set forth the year to which such election was first applicable. The deduction of taxes accrued in the year of election precludes the deduction of taxes paid during such year. The election, if made, shall be irrevocable and the deduction for taxes accrued shall be allowed for the year of election and for all subsequent taxable years.

In computing taxable income, a foreign personal holding company is allowed a deduction under section 164 for income, war profits, and excess-profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to foreign countries or possessions of the United States, but is not allowed the foreign tax credit under section 901. Therefore, in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income for any taxable year, no adjustment under section 556(b)(1) is allowed for such taxes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charitable contributions--(1) Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970. (i) Section 556(b)(2) provides that, in computing the deduction for charitable contributions for purposes of determining the undistributed foreign

personal holding company income of a corporation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A) and (B), relating to charitable contributions by individuals, shall apply and section 170(b)(2) and (5), relating to charitable contributions by corporations and carryover of certain excess charitable contributions made by individuals, respectively, shall not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970. (i) Section 556(b)(2) provides that, in computing the deduction for charitable contributions for purposes of determining the undistributed foreign

personal holding company income of a corporation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A) and (B), relating to charitable contributions by individuals, shall apply and section 170(b)(2) and (5), relating to charitable contributions by corporations and carryover of certain excess charitable contributions made by individuals, respectively, shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 556(b)(2) provides that, in computing the deduction for charitable contributions for purposes of determining the undistributed foreign

personal holding company income of a corporation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A) and (B), relating to charitable contributions by individuals, shall apply and section 170(b)(2) and (5), relating to charitable contributions by corporations and carryover of certain excess charitable contributions made by individuals, respectively, shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Although the limitations of section 170(b)(1)(A) and (B) are 10 and 20 percent, respectively, of the individual's adjusted gross income, the limitations are applied for purposes of section 556(b)(2) by using 10 and 20 percent, respectively, of the corporation's taxable income as adjusted for purposes of section 170(b)(2), that is, the same amount of taxable income to which the 5-percent limitation applied. Thus, the term adjusted gross income when used in section 170(b)(1) means the corporation's taxable income computed with the adjustments, other than the 5-percent limitation, provided in the first sentence of section 170(b)(2). However, a further adjustment for this purpose is that the taxable income shall also be computed without the deduction of the amount disallowed under section 556(b)(5), relating to expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer, and section 556(b)(6), relating to taxes and contributions to pension trusts, and without the inclusion of the amounts includible as dividends under section 555(b), relating to the inclusion in gross income of a foreign personal holding company of its distributive share of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of another company in which it is a shareholder. The carryover of charitable contributions made in a prior year, otherwise allowable as a deduction in computing taxable income to the extent provided in section 170(b)(2) and, with respect to contributions paid in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, in section 170(b)(5), shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> See Sec. 1.170-2 with respect to the charitable contributions to which the 10-percent limitation is applicable and the charitable contributions to which the 20-percent limitation is applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. (i) Section 556(b)(2) provides that, in computing the deduction allowable for charitable contributions for purposes of determining the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the limitations in section 170(b)(1) (A), (B), and (D)(i) (relating to charitable contributions by individuals) shall apply, and section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) (relating to excess charitable contributions by individuals of certain capital gain property), section 170(b)(2) (relating to the 5-percent limitation on charitable contributions by corporations), and section 170(d) (relating to carryovers of excess contributions of individuals and corporations) shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 556(b)(2) provides that, in computing the deduction allowable for charitable contributions for purposes of determining the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the limitations in section 170(b)(1) (A), (B), and (D)(i) (relating to charitable contributions by individuals) shall apply, and section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) (relating to excess charitable contributions by individuals of certain capital gain property), section 170(b)(2) (relating to the 5-percent limitation on charitable contributions by corporations), and section 170(d) (relating to carryovers of excess contributions of individuals and corporations) shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Although the limitations of section 170(b)(1) (A), (B), and (D)(i) are 50, 20, and 30 percent, respectively, of an individual's contribution base, these limitations are applied for purposes of section 556(b)(2) by using 50, 20, and 30 percent, respectively, of the corporation's taxable income as adjusted for purposes of section 170(b)(2), that is, the same amount of taxable income to which the 5-percent limitation applies. Thus, the term contribution base when used in section 170(b)(1) means the corporation's taxable income computed with the adjustments, other than the 5-percent limitation, provided in section 170(b)(2). However, a further adjustment for this purpose is that the taxable income shall also be computed without the deduction of the amount disallowed under section 556(b)(5), relating to expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer, and section 556(b)(6), relating to taxes and contributions to pension trusts, and without the inclusion of the amounts includible as dividends under section 555(b), relating to the inclusion in gross income of a foreign personal holding company of its distributive share of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of another company in which it is a shareholder. The carryover of charitable contributions made in a prior year, otherwise allowable as a deduction in

computing taxable income to the extent provided in section 170(b)(1) (D) (ii) and (d), shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> See Sec. 1.170A-8 for the rules with respect to the charitable contributions to which the 50-, 20-, and 30-percent limitations apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special deductions disallowed. Part VIII, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code allows corporations special deductions in computing taxable income for such matters as partially tax-exempt interest, certain dividends received, dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public utilities, organizational expenses, etc. See section 241. For purposes of computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income, such special deductions, except the deduction provided by section 248 (relating to organizational expenditures) and, with respect to such a computation for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1958, the deduction provided by section 242 (relating to partially tax-exempt interest), shall be disallowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Net operating loss. The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 is not allowed for purposes of the computation of undistributed foreign personal holding company income. For purposes of such a computation, however, there is allowed as a deduction the amount of the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the preceding taxable year, except that, in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income for a taxable year ending after December 31, 1957, the amount of such net operating loss shall be computed without the deductions provided in part VIII (section 241 and following) except section 248, relating to organizational expenditures, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the corporation. (1) Section 556(b)(5) provides a specific limitation in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income, with respect to the allowance of deductions for trade or business expenses and depreciation which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by a foreign personal holding company. Under this limitation these deductions shall not be allowed in excess of the aggregate amount of the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 556(b)(5) provides a specific limitation in computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income, with respect to the allowance of deductions for trade or business expenses and depreciation which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by a foreign personal holding company. Under this limitation these deductions shall not be allowed in excess of the aggregate amount of the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The burden of proof will rest upon the taxpayer to sustain the deduction claimed. If a United States shareholder, in computing his distributive share of undistributed foreign personal holding company income to be included in gross income in his individual return (see section 551, and Secs. 1.551-1 and 1.551-2), claims deductions for expenses and depreciation allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the company, in an aggregate amount in excess of the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, he shall attach to his income tax return a statement setting forth his claim for allowance of the additional deductions, together with a complete statement of the facts and circumstances pertinent to his claim and the arguments on which he relies. Such statement shall set forth:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost or other basis to the corporation and the nature and value of the consideration paid for the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of the person from whom the property was acquired and the date the property was acquired;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The name and address of the person to whom the property is leased or rented, or the person permitted to use the property, and the number of shares of stock, if any, held by such person and the members of his family;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The nature and gross amount of the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property during the taxable year and for each of the five preceding years and the amount of the expenses incurred with respect to, and the depreciation sustained on, the property for such years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Evidence that the rent or other compensation was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, a statement of the reasons therefor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In the case of a return for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, a copy of the contract, lease, or rental agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The purpose for which the property was used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The business carried on by the corporation with respect to which the property was held and the gross income, expenses, and taxable income derived from the conduct of such business for the taxable year and for each of the five preceding years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A statement of any reasons which existed for expectation that the operation of the property would be profitable, or a statement of the necessity for the use of the property in the business of the corporation, and the reasons why the property was acquired; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Any other information pertinent to the taxpayer's claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the statement described in Sec. 1.556-2(e)(2) is attached to a taxpayer's income tax return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, a copy of the applicable contract, lease or rental agreement is not required to be submitted with the return, but must be retained by the taxpayer and kept available for inspection in the manner required by Sec. 1.6001-1(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Taxes and contributions to pension trusts. Section 164(e) provides for deduction by a corporation for taxes of a shareholder paid by it; section 404 provides for deduction by an employer for its contributions to an employees' trust, etc. For the purpose of computing undistributed foreign personal holding company income, neither of these deductions is allowable.
