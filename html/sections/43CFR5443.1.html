                            <p class="depth0">If no bid is received within the time specified in the advertisement  of sale, and if the authorized officer determines that there has been no  significant rise in the market value, he may in his discretion, keep the  sale open for not to exceed 90 days by posting notice thereof in a  conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. If   during such period a written bid is submitted, together with the  required deposit, for not less than the advertised appraised value, a  notice of such bid shall be posted immediately after receipt of such bid  for seven successive days in the same office and in the same manner. If  no other written bid is received during the seven day posting period,  the sole bidder shall be deemed the high bidder. If, however, during  such seven day posting period other written bids are received, an oral  auction shall be conducted in the usual manner for those who have  submitted written bids. The authorized officer shall notify those who  have submitted written bids of the time and place of the oral auction.  The written bids shall be considered the initial bids in such oral  auction. If there is a tie in the high written bids that are submitted  during the seven day posting period and if no higher bid is offered  during the oral auction, the party who first submitted the high bid  shall be deemed the high bidder.
