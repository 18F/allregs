                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Food and Drug Administration will provide expedited  processing of a request for records when the requester demonstrates a  compelling need, or in other cases as determined by the agency. A  compelling need exists when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis  could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information, there is a demonstrated urgency to inform the  public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(1)  of this section must be made by the specific individual who is subject  to an imminent threat, or by a family member, medical or health care  professional, or other authorized representative of the individual, and  must demonstrate a reasonable basis for concluding that failure to  obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be  expected to pose a specific and identifiable imminent threat to the life  or safety of the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(2)  of this section must demonstrate that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information  to the general public and not merely to a narrow interest group;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is an urgent need for the requested information and that  it has a particular value that will be lost if not obtained and  disseminated quickly; however, a news media publication or broadcast  deadline alone does not qualify as an urgent need, nor does a request  for historical information; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The request for records specifically concerns identifiable  operations or activities of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All requests for expedited processing shall be filed in writing  as provided by Sec. 20.40. Each such request shall include information  that demonstrates a reasonable basis for concluding that a compelling  need exists within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section and a  certification that the information provided in the request is true and  correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. Any  statements made in support of a request for expedited processing are  subject to the False Reports to the Government Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee)  will determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing  within 10 days of receipt by the Division of Freedom of Information of  all information required to make a decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the agency grants a request for expedited processing, the  agency shall process the request as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the  agency shall process the request with other nonexpedited requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the  requester may appeal the agency's decision by writing to the official  identified in the denial letter.
