RUS may  request projections for a longer period of time if RUS deems necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial forecasts prepared in support of loan applications to  finance additional generation capacity shall include a power cost study  as set forth in Sec. 1710.303.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the requirements set forth in Sec. 1710.300,  financial forecasts prepared by power supply borrowers shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify all plans for generation and transmission capital  additions and system operating expenses on a year-by-year basis,  beginning with the present and running for 10 years, unless a longer  period of time has been requested by RUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Integrate projections of operation and maintenance expenses  associated with existing plant with those of new proposed facilities to  determine total costs of system operation as well as the costs of new  generation and generation-related facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide an in-depth analysis of the regional markets for power  if loan feasibility depends to any degree on a borrower's ability to  sell surplus power while its system loads grow to meet the planned  capacity of a proposed plant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If not previously submitted, furnish RUS with all material  information on operating agreements, ownership agreements, fuel  contracts and any other special agreements that affect annual cost  projections, as may be required by RUS on a case by case basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include sensitivity analysis if required by RUS pursuant to  Sec. 1710.300(d)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The projections shall be coordinated in advance with RUS so that  agreement can be reached on major aspects of the economic studies.
