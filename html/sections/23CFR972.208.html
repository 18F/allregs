                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements provided in Sec. 972.204, the PMS  must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FWS shall, at a minimum, have PMS coverage of all paved  refuge roads and other associated facilities, as appropriate, funded  under the FLHP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The PMS may be based on the concepts described in the AASHTO's  ``Pavement Management Guide.''\2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ ``Pavement Management Guide,'' AASHTO, 2001, is available for  inspection as prescribed at 49 CFR part 7. It is also available from the  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  (AASHTO), Publication Order Dept., P.O. Box 96716, Washington, DC 20090- 6716 or online at http://www.transportation.org/publications/ bookstore.nsf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The PMS may be utilized at various levels of technical  complexity depending on the nature of the pavement network. These  different levels may depend on mileages, functional classes, volumes,  loadings, usage, surface type, or other criteria the FWS deems  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The PMS shall be designed to fit the FWS goals, policies,  criteria, and needs using the following components, at a minimum, as a  basic framework for a PMS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A database and an ongoing program for the collection and  maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data  needed to support the PMS. The minimum PMS database shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An inventory of the physical pavement features including the  number of lanes, length, width, surface type, functional classification,  and shoulder information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A history of project dates and types of construction,  reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventive maintenance. If some of  the inventory or historic data are difficult to establish, it may be  collected when preservation or reconstruction work is performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A condition survey that includes ride, distress, rutting, and  surface friction (as appropriate);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Traffic information including volumes and vehicle  classification (as appropriate); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Data for estimating the costs of actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A system for applying network level analytical procedures that  are capable of analyzing data for all FWS managed transportation  facilities in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pavement condition analysis that includes ride, distress,  rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A pavement performance analysis that includes present and  predicted performance and an estimate of the remaining service life  (performance and remaining service life to be developed with time); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An investment analysis that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identifies alternative strategies to improve pavement  conditions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Estimates costs of any pavement improvement strategy;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Determines maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies  for pavements using life-cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Provides short and long term budget forecasting; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Recommends optimal allocation of limited funds by developing a  prioritized list of candidate projects over a predefined planning  horizon (both short and long term).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For any FWS managed transportation facilities in the inventory  or subset thereof, PMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not  limited to, percentage of roads in good, fair, and poor condition.</p>
