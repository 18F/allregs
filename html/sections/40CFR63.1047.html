                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners and operators that use a separator equipped with a fixed roof in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  63.1042 of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions to the atmosphere. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the separator wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the fixed roof. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the

requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.1048(a)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Owners and operators that use a separator equipped with a floating roof in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  63.1043 of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall measure the floating roof seal gaps using the procedure specified in Sec.  63.1046(b) of this subpart in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall perform measurements of gaps between the separator wall and the primary seal within 60 days after initial operation of the separator following installation of the floating roof and, thereafter, at least once every 5 years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall perform measurements of gaps between the separator wall and the secondary seal within 60 days after initial operation of the separator following installation of the floating roof and, thereafter, at least once every year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a separator ceases to hold regulated-material for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of regulated-material into the separator shall be considered an initial operation for the purpose of complying with paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the event that the seal gap measurements do not conform to the specifications in Sec.  63.1043(b)(2) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.1048 (a)(2) and (b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall visually inspect the floating roof in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The floating roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions to the atmosphere.
