                            <p class="depth0">This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., as amended). The Act requires that technology transfer be established as a mission of each Government-owned laboratory operated under contract by a non-Federal entity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 expanded the definition of ``laboratory'' to include weapon production facilities that are operated for national security purposes and are engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components.</p>
