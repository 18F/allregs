                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The following additional procedures apply when  processing requests for confidential commercial information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential commercial information means records provided to  the Government by a submitter that contain material arguably exempt from  release under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be  expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means a person or entity which provides to the  Government information which may constitute confidential commercial  information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to,  individuals, partnerships, corporations, State governments, and foreign  governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(8)</em> and 52.215-12 also apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedural requirements--consultation with the submitter. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If  GSA receives a FOIA request for potentially confidential commercial  information, it will notify the submitter immediately by telephone and  invite an opinion whether disclosure will or will not cause substantial  competitive harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> GSA will follow up the telephonic notice promptly in writing  before releasing any records unless paragraph (f) of this section  applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the submitter indicates an objection to disclosure GSA will  give the submitter seven workdays from receipt of the letter to provide  GSA with a detailed written explanation of how disclosure of any  specified portion of the records would be competitively harmful.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the submitter verbally states that there is no objection to  disclosure, GSA will confirm this fact in writing before disclosing any  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> At the same time GSA notifies the submitter, it will also advise  the requester that there will be a delay in responding to the request  due to the need to consult with the submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> GSA will review the reasons for nondisclosure before  independently deciding whether the information must be released or  should be withheld. If GSA decides to release the requested information,  it will provide the submitter with a written statement explaining why  his or her objections are not sustained. The letter to the submitter  will contain a copy of the material to be disclosed or will offer the  submitter an opportunity to review the material in none of GSA's  offices. If GSA decides not to release the material, it will notify the  submitter orally or in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If GSA determines to disclose information over a submitter's  objections, it will inform the submitter the GSA will delay disclosure  for 5 workdays from the estimated date the submitter receives GSA's  decision before it releases the information. The decision letter to the  requester shall state that GSA will delay disclosure of material it has  determined to disclose to allow for the notification of the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When notice is required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For confidential commercial  information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a  submitter whenever it receives a FOIA request for such information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the records are less than 10 years old and the information  has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial  information; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If GSA has reason to believe that disclosure of the information  could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For confidential commercial information submitted on or after  January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a submitter whenever it determines that  the agency may be required to disclose records:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the submitter has previously designated as privileged or  confidential; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That GSA believes could reasonably be expected to cause  substantial competitive harm if disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> GSA will provide notice to a submitter for a period of up to 10  years after the date of submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this  section will not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> GSA determines that the information should not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been published or has been officially made  available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by law other than the  FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure is required by an agency rule that</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency  that are to be released under FOIA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the  submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is  submitted for a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the  information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial  competitive harm;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The information is not designated by the submitter as exempt  from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, unless GSA has  substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would  be competitively harmful; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The designation made by the submitter in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that,  in such cases, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice  of any final administrative decision five workdays prior to disclosing  the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Lawsuits. If a FOIA requester sues the agency to compel  disclosure of confidential commercial information, GSA will notify the  submitter as soon as possible. If the submitter sues GSA to enjoin  disclosure of the records, GSA will notify the requester.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 105	60.5_Exemptions</p>
