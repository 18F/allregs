                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This chapter requires soldiers to provide financial  support to family members and to obey court orders on child custody. It  also provides guidance and policy to commanders to follow when resolving  nonsupport and child custody issues. Consistent with specific provisions  below, a soldier will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Furnish financial support to family members that meets at least  the minimum support requirements of this regulation (Sec. 584.2(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide such additional support within his or her financial  ability to   meet the financial needs of family members (Sec. 584.2(j)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comply with all court-imposed obligations (Sec. 584.2(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Obey court orders and this regulation on child custody and  visitation rights (Sec. 584.2(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iii). In all cases, Army support policy for  family members should be considered temporary until either an agreement  has been reached between the parties (including those acting on behalf  of minor children) or court action has been taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Oral agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Written support agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Court orders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each complaint of nonsupport will be considered individually by  the soldier's immediate commander. Alleged desertion or other marital  misconduct on the part of a spouse has no effect on a soldier's  obligation to provide financial support as required by Sec. 584.2(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Separation from family due to military service. Military service  often requires soldiers to live separately from their families during  oversea service or extended temporary duty. Soldiers must plan carefully  for the support of their families during these periods. Commanders will  educate soldiers and their families on the advantages of joint bank  accounts. Such arrangements usually minimize the hardship and financial  burden on family members that may occur during periods of such  separation. If proper, commanders will urge soliders to start an  allotment to or for their family to ensure continuous financial support.  The amount of such a support allotment should be set up by agreement  between the soldier and his or her family. In the absence of such an  agreement or a court order, the provisions of Sec. 584.2(d)(2) apply.  Each soldier is expected to keep reasonable contact with family members  to minimize inquiries, claims, and compliants sent to Army officials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Support by oral agreement, written support agreement, or court  order--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Oral agreement. It is not the Army's policy to involve itself  in disputes over the terms or enforcement of oral support agreements.  Where an oral agreement exists and is being followed, the Army need not  and will not interfere. When a dispute arises, the Army will require  compliance only with the provisions of this regulation. Thus, if a  family member complains that a soldier is not sending an agreed upon  amount that is less or more than the minimum required by Sec. 584.2(d),  the commander will advise the soldier to either send the agreed upon  amount or the minimum amount required by Sec. 584.2(d). Section  584.2(d) applies when the parties cannot reach an oral agreement or the  amount agreed upon is in dispute. In appropriate cases, the commander  can order additional support beyond the minimum amount required by Sec.  584.2(d). (See Sec. 584.2(j).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  apply. The amount specified in the written agreement will be deemed  adequate until modified by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Another agreement reduced to writing and signed by both parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Court order. (i) Court orders often contain other financial  obligations, such as provisions for property division, marital property  awards, and payment of medical and other expenses. Commanders have a  responsibility to ensure that soldiers comply with these provisions.  Soldiers will comply with all court-imposed obligations. Failure to do  so may result in costly and time-consuming litigation or court contempt  proceedings. These actions often are to the detriment of the soldier and  the unit's readiness mission. Section 584.2 (d)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, however, only  applies to court orders directing the soldier to provide financial  support to family members on a periodic basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Court orders under this regulation include those orders issued  by the courts of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The courts must  have acquired valid jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of  articles 32 through 37 of the Supplementary Agreement concerning foreign  forces stationed in the FRG. This agreement supplements the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization Status of Forces Agreement. A soldier will  comply with all other foreign nation court and administrative orders  that are recognized by treaty or international agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commanders should be aware that conditions may have changed  greatly from when a court order was issued. For example, a soldier may  have gained other family responsibilies. Many outstanding and  uncontested support orders against soldiers cause severe hardship. Such  orders can only be modified by a court. If a soldier's income appears  inadequate to satisfy an outstanding order and still maintain the  soldier, the commander should urge the individual to consult a legal  assistance attorney. However, the soldier will comply with the terms of  a court order until relieved of this obligation by modification of the  order by a court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minimum support requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Soldiers will not violate the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Financial support provisions of a court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Financial support provisions of a written support agreement in  the absence of a court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interim minimum financial support requirements of Sec.  584.2(d)(2) in the absence of a court order or written support  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of a court order or written support agreement,  and until such an order or agreement is obtained, the following interim  minimum financial support requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Single family units. (A) Family not living in Government family  quarters. The soldier will provide support in an amount equal to the  soldier's BAQ at the with-dependents rate. This amount of financial  support will be provided for this family unit regardless of whether or  not the soldier is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receiving BAQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Occupying Government family quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Family living in Government family quarters. While the supported  family is occupying Government family quarters, the soldier will provide  an amount equal to the difference between BAQ at the with- and without- dependents rate. When the supported family members move out of  Government family quarters, support will be provided in an amount equal  to BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple-family units. In multi-family unit support situations,  each supported family member will receive a pro-rata share of the BAQ at  the with-dependents rate. This share will be determined by dividing an  amount equal to BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank  by the total number of supported family members (excluding former  spouses). The following modifications apply: First, any court ordered  support will be paid as stated. Secondly, supported families living in  Government family quarters will receive an amount equal to the  difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate for the  soldier's rank. Lastly, any remaining family members (excluding former  spouses) will receive a pro-rata share of the BAQ amount. This will be  provided regardless of the amount of support paid to other family  members. Following are examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Example 1. A soldier is divorced and has three children from  that marriage. The soldier is required by a court order to pay $300 per  month for the children and $100 per month for the former spouse. The  soldier has remarried and has two more family members (spouse and child)  living in private housing. The soldier now has a total of five family  members that he or she must support under Army policy. (A former spouse  does not qualify as a family member in pro-rata determinations.) The  children by the previous marriage must receive $300 and the former  spouse must receive $100 per the court order. The present spouse and  child should receive support equal to two-fifths of BAQ at the with- dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example 2. A soldier has one child by a previous marriage. There  is no   court order for child support. The soldier is unable to show that the  court granting the divorce had personal jurisdiction over the soldier so  as to be able to order child support. The soldier has remarried and has  a spouse and two children living in private housing. The soldier now has  a total of four family members that he or she must support under Army  policy. (These family members are the child by a previous marriage and  the present spouse and two children.) Each family member should receive  support equal to one-fourth of BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the  soldier's rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example 3. A soldier has two children by a previous marriage.  The soldier is required by court order to pay $200 per month for these  children. Also, the soldier is required to pay $75 per month for support  of a child per a court order that has declared him to be the father. He  has remarried and has a spouse and three children living in Government  family quarters. The soldier now has a total of seven family members  that he must support under Army policy. The children by his previous  marriage must receive $200 per the court order. His other child must  receive $75 per the court order. The spouse and children of his present  marriage should receive an amount equal to the difference between BAQ at  the with- and without-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Military members married to one another. In the absence of a  court order or written support agreement, an Army soldier is not  required to provide support to a spouse on active duty in the Armed  Forces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Children of military member parents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Single family units. In the absence of a court order or written  support agreement, the following interim support requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Single family units when the Army soldier does not have custody  of any children of the marriage. The Army soldier will pay an amount  equal to the difference between his or her own BAQ at the with- and  without-dependents rate to the military member having custody of the  child or children of the marriage. This amount of financial support will  be provided regardless of which military member, if any, is receving BAQ  or occupying Government family quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Single family units when the Army soldier has custody of the  child or children of the marriage (for example, Army soldier has custody  of one child and spouse has custody of two children). In this situation,  the Army soldier is not required to provide a minimum amount of  financial support for the children in the other military member's  custody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiple-family units. The provisions of Sec. 584.2(d)(2)(ii)  apply. However, the amount in Sec. 584.2(d)(2)(iv)(A) will not be  diminished by proration because of the Army soldier's financial support  obligations to other family members. For example: An Army soldier has an  adopted child from a previous marriage. The soldier is required by court  order to pay $150 per month for this child. The soldier presently is  married to a spouse on active duty with the Air Force. They have two  children from this marriage. The Air Force member and children reside in  private housing. The Army soldier has a total of three family members  that he or she must support. The Army soldier will pay $150 a month to  the adopted child per the court order. The children from the present  marriage will receive an amount equal to the difference between his or  her BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rates for the Army soldier's  rank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A commander has no authority to excuse a soldier from complying  with the interim minimum support requirements of Sec. 584.2(d)(2) when  they are applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the absence of a contrary provision in a written support  agreement or court order, monthly financial support to family members  will be sent before the last calendar day of the month for which the  support is due. If the family members are not residing together, the  soldier will ensure each family member receives his or her pro-rata  share. (For example, spouse lives along and the children live with their  grandparents.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Child custody. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A soldier relative, who is aware that another  person is a lawful custodian of an unmarried child under the age of 14  years, will not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Abduct, taken, entice, or carry away the child from the lawful  custodian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withhold, detain, or conceal the child away from the lawful  custodian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A ``lawful custodian'' is a person authorized, either along or  together with another person or persons, to have custody and exercise  control over a child less than 14 years of age by order of a court. The  fact that joint custody has been awarded to both parents by a court does  not preclude a violation of this paragraph by the soldier parent.  However, in the absence of a court order to the contrary, the mother of  a child born out of wedlock who is not then, nor has ever been, married  to the father of the child is deemed the ``lawful custodian'' of that  child for the purpose of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A soldier relative is a soldier who is the parent, grandparent,  brother, sister, uncle, aunt, or one who has at some time been the  lawful custodian of the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is a defense to a violation of this paragraph that the  soldier--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of the offense had custody of the child to the  exclusion of others pursuant to a valid order of a court having  jurisdiction over the child; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Voluntarily returned the child to the lawful custodian within  96 hours after return was demanded by the lawful custodian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Relief from the minimum support requirement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Court orders  with financial support provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Court ordered financial support will be by the terms of the  court order. Relief from a court order can only be obtained under the  law. Nothing in this regulation affects or lessens a soldier's legal  obligation to comply strictly with the terms of a court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A soldier who disobeys a court order may be held in contempt of  the court that issued the order. Also, a soldier may be punished for  violating this regulation. It is, however, a defense to any violation of  Sec. 584.2(d)(1)(i) that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The court issuing the order was without jurisdiction to do so,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The soldier at all times has been complying with any of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The financial support provisions of another court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The financial support provisions of a written support agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The interim minimum financial support requirements of Sec.  584.2(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Court orders without financial support provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A soldier will provide financial support to family members  unless expressly relieved of this obligation by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Written support agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A soldier will provide financial support under Sec.  584.2(f)(2) to family members, which meets at least the minimum support  requirements of this regulation. The financial support will be provided  even when a court order contains no provision as to support except as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A soldier has no obligation to provide financial support to a  former spouse except by order of court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A soldier has no obligation to provide financial support to  minor children of the marriage if he or she can show the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The court issuing the final order of divorce had personal  jurisdiction over the soldier to order child support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The soldier is not receiving BAQ at the ``with dependents'' rate  based solely on the support of the minor children in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Written support agreements. If a financial support obligation is  evidenced by a written agreement between the parties, the soldier can  only be relieved of this obligation by another written agreement or by  court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Greater spousal income. In the absence of a written support  agreement or court order, a soldier has no obligation to support a  civilian spouse who is receiving an annual income equal to or greater  than the annual gross pay of the soldier. The income of the spouse does  not affect the soldier's obligation to provide financial support to the  children of that marriage in the physical custody of the spouse on a  pro-rata basis. Example: A soldier is living in Government family  quarters with one of their children. The soldier's spouse deserted the  soldier and lives in private housing with their other child. The  soldier's spouse earns $5,000 more in annual income from a civilian job  than the soldier earns in annual gross pay.   There is no court order or written support agreement. The soldier has a  total of three family members. However, under Army support policy, the  soldier does not have to provide a pro-rata share of financial support  to the spouse because the spouse's income exceeds that of the soldier.  (Note that under Sec. 584.2(a)(3) marital misconduct is not a relevant  consideration.) The soldier must support the child in Government family  quarters. In addition, the soldier must provide an amount equal to one- third of BAQ (pro-rata share) at the ``with dependents'' rate to the  spouse on behalf of the child living with the spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Commander's inquiries. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a soldier denies he or she has a  financial obligation to support a spouse or children for any reason, the  soldier's commander will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inquire into the matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consult with the SJA prior to determining whether or not there  is a support obligation. If there is no support obligation, BAQ at the  ``with dependents'' rate should be stopped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a soldier claims he or she has made support payments as  required by this regulation, the soldier's commander will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Request the soldier to provide proof of payment in one of the  following forms:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Canceled personal checks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Leave and earnings statements showing allotments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Postal or money order receipts accompanied by a sworn statement  from the soldier that the order was sent to the family member. If  possible, evidence that the postal or money order was cashed by the  complaining party should be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other acceptable evidence of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consult with the SJA, if necessary, to determine whether the  soldier has provided enough proof of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a soldier is suspected of violating a child custody or  visitation rights in a court order, the soldier's commander will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inquire into the matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consult with the SJA prior to taking action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In any case in which the soldier is suspected of violating this  regulation (Sec. 584.2(d) or (e)), or of having committed other  offenses, the commander, prior to questioning the soldier, will advise  him or her of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The suspected offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The right to remain silent under article 31, UCMJ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Form of support payment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the  court order or by agreement, a financial support payment will be made in  one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By check or money order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> By allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A soldier will receive credit for payments made to others on  behalf of, and with the agreement of, the supported family members.  Examples of support provided in kind include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Utility services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interest and principal due on loans, mortgages, or charge  accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Insurance payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Arrearages--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. A soldier who falls into arrears  without legal justification or excuse is in violation of Sec. 584.2(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Court orders and written support agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts in arrears based on a past failure to comply with a  court order or written support agreement will be paid at once in a lump  sum amount. If an immediate lump sum payment is impractical, soldiers  are expected to work out arrangements with the court or the affected  family members to pay arrearages on a scheduled basis. If arrangements  can not be worked out, commanders will intervene and order payment of  arrearages on a scheduled basis based on the soldier's ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When arrearages arise from noncompliance with court orders and  written support agreements, this may result in--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Garnishment of the soldier's pay account (Sec. 584.8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Initiation of an involuntary allotment against the soldier's pay  account (Sec. 584.9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contempt of court proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Recoupment of BAQ received by the soldier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Administrative or punitive action may be taken on a violation  of this regulation for any month in which the soldier failed to provide  the required financial support even if the amount in arrears eventually  is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interim minimum financial support requirements. A soldier should  be encouraged to pay the amount in arrears based on past noncompliance  with the interim minimum financial support requirements (Sec. 584.2(d)  (1)(iii) and (2)). However, a soldier cannot be ordered to pay such an  amount. Nevertheless, administrative or punitive action may be taken on  a violation of this regulation for any month in which the soldier failed  to provide the required financial support even if the amount in arrears  eventually is paid. Also, failure to provide required financial support  in the past may be considered, together with other factors, in a  commander's determination of the amount of additional support that may  be ordered. (See Sec. 584.2(j).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Additional support where there is no support agreement or court  order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em>.  However, a soldier should provide additional support within his or her  ability to meet the basic financial needs of family members when the  interim support requirements of this regulation are shown to be  inadequate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If there is a demonstrated need for immediate and temporary  additional support because of unexpected and unforeseen circumstances  and the parties are unable to agree on such additional support, a  commander may order temporary additional support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commanders will consider the following factors in determining  the amount of additional support, if any, that a soldier should provide  when a request for additional support is received:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The pay, allowances, separate income, and other financial  resources of both the soldier and the family member for whom additional  support is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The earning capacity of the family member on whose behalf  support is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The financial savings of the soldier and family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The separate and joint debts of the soldier and family member,  by whom those debts were incurred, and the reasons behind them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The soldier's duty to provide financial support to other family  members, including former spouses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The financial needs of the soldier and the family member and  whether these needs are temporary or permanent in nature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The standard of living of the soldier and family member and  whether such standard of living is reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> With regard to spousal support, the duration of the marriage  and the circumstances under which the parties separated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The extent of the soldier's or family member's compliance with  existing court orders and written support agreements. This includes  those provisions dealing with child custody, visitation rights, property  division, and marital property awards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The amount in arrears owed by the soldier based on past  noncompliance with the minimum support requirements. (See Sec. 584.2  (d) and (i).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Any other fact which, in the judgment of the commander, has a  logical bearing upon the amount of additional support the soldier  reasonably should be expected to provide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Procedure for making complaints. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Complaints about nonsupport  of family members and noncompliance with court orders on financial  support and child custody should be sent through command channels. The  complainant should be referred to the immediate commander of the soldier  concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Inspector General (IG) may assist in properly routing the  complaint. The IG also may assist if the responsible commander has  failed to respond in a satisfactory manner or as required by this  regulation. (See AR 20-1, para 4-9.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The USACFSC (DACF-IS-PA) has set up an office to assist in these  cases.   USACFSC will provide policy interpretations and guidance on unresolved  or complex cases, as needed.

He or she will do the following if the information is  incomplete:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acknowledge receipt of the complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explain that the information or documentation sent is not  enough to give proper help.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If appropriate, send the complainant DA Form 5460-R (Request  for Help in Receiving Support and/or Identification Cards for Family  Members).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Advise that help will be given with the complaint upon return  of the completed form and other requested information and documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If appropriate, advise that DA Form 5460-R alone is not enough  documentation for issuance of a dependent identification card (ID card)  (AR 640-3). Documentation (that is, court orders, birth certificates,  marriage certificates, etc.) must be provided to support eligibility for  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Answer any policy or procedural questions that have been asked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of DA Form 5460-R or a complaint that has enough  information to properly respond, the commander will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review soldier's legal financial obligations in light of the  complaint and the facts presented by all parties concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If necessary, ask the SJA if the complaint is valid, if the  soldier must provide financial support or give up custody of children,  and any other related questions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notify the soldier of the complaint of nonsupport or of a  violation of a child custody court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Require the soldier to complete and sign DA Form 5459-R.

Therefore, collection action may be initiated by the Army.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Explain what garnishment is (Sec. 584.8) and how it might  affect the soldier's pay, allowances, and allotments.

The allotment should be for the mutually agreed amount,  court order, or as computed under this regulation. An account may be set  up in a financial institution by the recipient to receive the allotment.  This action may preclude delays in receipt and other related problems in  the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Help the soldier start an allotment to make the required  support payments. Also, advise the soldier to let the commander know if  there is a change or stoppage to the support allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Give the soldier a chance to consult with a legal assistance  attorney if he or she desires. However, the commander should ensure that  this is not used as a delaying tactic.
