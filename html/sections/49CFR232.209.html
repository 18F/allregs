                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At a location other than the initial terminal of a train, a  Class II brake test shall be performed by a qualified person, as defined  in Sec. 232.5, on the following equipment when added to a train:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each car or solid block of cars, as defined in Sec. 232.5, that  has not previously received a Class I brake test or that has been off  air for more than four hours;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each solid block of cars, as defined in Sec. 232.5, that is  comprised of cars from more than one previous train; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, each  solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from only one previous  train, the cars of which have not remained continuously and  consecutively coupled together with the train line remaining connected  since being removed from the previous train. A solid block of cars is  considered to have remained continuously and consecutively coupled  together with the train line remaining connected since being removed  from the previous train if it has been changed only by removing  defective equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from a single  previous train, the cars of which were required to be separated into  multiple solid blocks of cars due to space or trackage constraints at a  particular location when removed from the previous train, if they are  not added in the same relative order as when removed from the previous  train or if the cars in each of the multiple blocks of cars have not  remained continuously and consecutively coupled together with the train  line remaining connected, except for the removal of defective equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Class II brake test shall consist of the following tasks and  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The air brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which  the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train  shall be within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be  operated, but not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or  end-of-train device at the rear end of train;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The brakes on each car added to the train and on the rear car of  the train shall be inspected to ensure that they apply in response to a  20-psi brake pipe service reduction and remain applied until the release  is initiated from the controlling locomotive. A car found with brakes  that fail to apply or remain applied may be retested and remain in the  train if the retest is conducted as prescribed in Sec. 232.205(c)(4);  otherwise, the defective equipment may only be moved pursuant to the  provisions of Sec. 232.15, if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the release is initiated, the brakes on each car added to  the train and on the rear car of the train shall be inspected to verify  that they did release; this may be performed by a ``roll-by''  inspection. If a ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release is  performed, train speed shall not exceed 10 MPH, and the qualified person  performing the ``roll-by'' inspection shall communicate the results of  the inspection to the operator of the train; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Before the train proceeds the operator of the train shall know  that the brake pipe pressure at the rear of the train is being restored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As an alternative to the rear car brake application and release  portion of the test, the operator of the train shall determine that  brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced, as indicated by a  rear car gauge or end-of-train telemetry device, and then that the brake  pipe pressure of the train is being restored, as indicated by a rear car  gauge or end-of-train telemetry device. (When an end-of-train telemetry  device is used to comply with any test requirement in this part, the  phrase ``brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced'' means a  pressure reduction of at least 5 psi, and the phrase ``brake pipe  pressure of the train is being restored'' means a pressure increase of  at least 5 psi). If an electronic communication link between a  controlling locomotive and a remotely controlled locomotive attached to  the rear end of a train is utilized to determine that brake pipe  pressure is being restored, the operator of the train shall know that  the air brakes function as intended on the remotely controlled  locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each car or solid block of cars that receives a Class II brake  test pursuant to this section when added to the train shall receive a  Class I brake test at the next forward location where facilities are  available for performing such a test.
