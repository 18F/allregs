                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative Conference of the United States (``ACUS'' or ``the agency'') follows under the Privacy Act of 1974 (``the Privacy Act''), 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, regarding the protection of, and individual access to, certain records about individuals. These rules should be read together with and are governed by the Privacy Act itself, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in Privacy Act systems of records maintained by the agency, which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request

amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the agency. In addition, the agency processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, following the rules contained in subpart A of this part. Thus, all Privacy Act requests will be subject to exemptions for access to records only applicable under both FOIA and the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Request for access to a record'' means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Request for amendment or correction of a record'' means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Request for an accounting'' means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Requester'' means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act.</p>
