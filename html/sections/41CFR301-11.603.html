                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are on a taxable extended TDY assignment, then all allowances and reimbursements for travel expenses, plus all travel expenses that the Government pays directly on your behalf in connection with your TDY assignment, are taxable income to you. This includes all allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors from the day that you or your agency recognized that your extended TDY assignment is expected to exceed one year, as explained in Sec.  301-11.601.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your agency will reimburse you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your taxable extended TDY assignment. This reimbursement consists of two parts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA). See Part 302-17, Subpart B of this Subtitle for information on the WTA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ``Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance'' (ETTRA) (in previous editions of the FTR this was known as the ``Income Tax Reimbursement Allowance'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The WTA and ETTRA for taxable extended TDY assignments cover only the TDY benefits described in FTR Chapter 301, Subchapter B. On an extended TDY assignment, you are not eligible for the other benefits that you would have received if your agency had permanently relocated you.
