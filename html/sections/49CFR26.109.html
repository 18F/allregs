                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Availability of records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In responding to requests for  information concerning any aspect of the DBE program, the Department  complies with provisions of the Federal Freedom of Information and  Privacy Acts (5 U.S.C. 552 and 552a). The Department may make available  to the public any information concerning the DBE program release of  which is not prohibited by Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of Federal or state law, you must  not release any information that may reasonably be construed as  confidential business information to any third party without the written  consent of the firm that submitted the information. This includes  applications for DBE certification and supporting information. However,  you must transmit this information to DOT in any certification appeal  proceeding under Sec. 26.89 of this part or to any other state to which  the individual's firm has applied for certification under Sec. 26.85 of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Confidentiality of information on complainants. Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the identity of  complainants shall be kept confidential, at their election. If such  confidentiality will hinder the investigation, proceeding or hearing, or  result in a denial of appropriate administrative due process to other  parties, the complainant must be advised for the purpose of waiving the  privilege. Complainants are advised that, in some circumstances, failure  to waive the privilege may result in the closure of the investigation or  dismissal of the proceeding or hearing. FAA follows the procedures of 14  CFR part 16 with respect to confidentiality of information in  complaints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cooperation. All participants in the Department's DBE program  (including, but not limited to, recipients, DBE firms and applicants for  DBE certification, complainants and appellants, and contractors using  DBE firms to meet contract goals) are required to cooperate fully and  promptly with DOT and recipient compliance reviews, certification  reviews, investigations, and other requests for information. Failure to  do so shall be a ground for appropriate action against the party  involved (e.g., with respect to recipients, a finding of noncompliance;  with respect to DBE firms, denial of certification or removal of  eligibility and/or suspension and debarment; with respect to a  complainant or appellant, dismissal of the complaint or appeal; with  respect to a contractor which uses DBE firms to meet goals, findings of  non-responsibility for future contracts and/or suspension and  debarment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Intimidation and retaliation. If you are a recipient,  contractor, or any other participant in the program, you must not  intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual or  firm for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured  by this part or because the individual or firm has made a complaint,  testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this part. If you violate this prohibition,  you are in noncompliance with this part.  [64 FR 5126, Feb. 2, 1999, as amended at 68 FR 35556, June 16, 2003; 76  FR 5101, Jan. 28, 2011]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 26--Guidance Concerning Good Faith Efforts</p><p class="depth0">I. When, as a recipient, you establish a contract goal on a DOT- assisted contract for procuring construction, equipment, services, or  any other purpose, a bidder must, in order to be responsible and/or  responsive, make sufficient good faith efforts to meet the goal. The  bidder can meet this requirement in either of two ways. First, the  bidder can meet the goal, documenting commitments for participation by  DBE firms sufficient for this purpose. Second, even if it doesn't meet  the goal, the bidder can document adequate good faith efforts. This  means that the bidder must show that it took all necessary and  reasonable steps to achieve a DBE goal or other requirement of this part  which, by their scope, intensity, and appropriateness to the objective,  could reasonably be expected to obtain sufficient DBE participation,  even if they were not fully successful.</p><p class="depth0">II. In any situation in which you have established a contract goal,  Part 26 requires you to use the good faith efforts mechanism of this  part. As a recipient, you have the responsibility to make a fair and  reasonable judgment whether a bidder that did not meet the goal made  adequate good faith efforts. It is important for you to consider the  quality, quantity, and intensity of the different kinds of efforts that  the bidder has made, based on the regulations and the guidance in this  Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">The efforts employed by the bidder should be those that one could  reasonably expect a bidder to take if the bidder were actively and  aggressively trying to obtain DBE participation sufficient to meet the  DBE contract goal. Mere pro forma efforts are not good faith efforts to  meet the DBE contract requirements. We emphasize, however, that your  determination concerning the sufficiency of the firm's good faith  efforts is a judgment call. Determinations should not be made using  quantitative formulas.</p><p class="depth0">III. The Department also strongly cautions you against requiring  that a bidder meet a contract goal (i.e., obtain a specified amount of  DBE participation) in order to be awarded a contract, even though the  bidder makes an adequate good faith efforts showing. This rule  specifically prohibits you from ignoring bona fide good faith efforts.</p><p class="depth0">IV. The following is a list of types of actions which you should  consider as part of the bidder's good faith efforts to obtain DBE  participation. It is not intended to be a mandatory checklist, nor is it  intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. Other factors or types of  efforts may be relevant in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conducing market research to identify small business  contractors and suppliers and soliciting through all reasonable and  available means the interest of all certified DBEs that have the  capability to perform the work of the contract. This may include  attendance at pre-bid and business matchmaking meetings and events,  advertising and/or written notices, posting of Notices of Sources Sought  and/or Requests for Proposals, written notices or emails to all DBEs  listed in the State's directory of transportation firms that specialize  in the areas of work desired (as noted in the DBE directory) and which  are located in the area or surrounding areas of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bidder should solicit this interest as early in the  acquisition process as practicable to allow the DBEs to respond to the  solicitation and submit a timely offer for the subcontract. The bidder  should determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by taking  appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">B. Selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order  to increase the likelihood that the DBE goals will be achieved. This  includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into  economically feasible units (for example, smaller tasks or quantities)  to facilitate DBE participation, even when the prime contractor might  otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. This  may include, where possible, establishing flexible timeframes for  performance and delivery schedules in a manner that encourages and  facilitates DBE participation.</p><p class="depth0">C. Providing interested DBEs with adequate information about the  plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract in a timely  manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation with their offer  for the subcontract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Negotiating in good faith with interested DBEs. It is the  bidder's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE  subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or  material needs consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and  suppliers, so as to facilitate DBE participation. Evidence of such  negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of DBEs  that were considered; a description of the information provided  regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for  subcontracting; and evidence as to why additional Agreements could not  be reached for DBEs to perform the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of  factors in negotiating with subcontractors, including DBE  subcontractors, and would take a firm's price and capabilities as well  as contract goals into consideration. However, the fact that there may  be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in  itself sufficient reason for a bidder's failure to meet the contract DBE  goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire  of a prime contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own  organization does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make  good faith efforts. Prime contractors are not, however, required to  accept higher quotes from DBEs if the price difference is excessive or  unreasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not rejecting DBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons  based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. The  contractor's standing within its industry, membership in specific  groups, organizations, or associations and political or social  affiliations (for example union vs. non-union status) are not legitimate  causes for the rejection or non-solicitation of bids in the contractor's  efforts to meet the project goal. Another practice considered an  insufficient good faith effort is the rejection of the DBE because its  quotation for the work was not the lowest received. However, nothing in  this paragraph shall be construed to require the bidder or prime  contractor to accept unreasonable quotes in order to satisfy contract  goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A prime contractor's inability to find a replacement DBE at the  original price is not alone sufficient to support a finding that good  faith efforts have been made to replace the original DBE. The fact that  the contractor has the ability and/or desire to perform the contract  work with its own forces does not relieve the contractor of the  obligation to make good faith efforts to find a replacement DBE, and it  is not a sound basis for rejecting a prospective replacement DBE's  reasonable quote.</p><p class="depth0">F. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining bonding,  lines of credit, or insurance as required by the recipient or  contractor.</p><p class="depth0">G. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining necessary  equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services.</p><p class="depth0">H. Effectively using the services of available minority/women  community organizations; minority/women contractors' groups; local,  State, and Federal minority/women business assistance offices; and other  organizations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance  in the recruitment and placement of DBEs.</p><p class="depth0">V. In determining whether a bidder has made good faith efforts, it  is essential to scrutinize its documented efforts. At a minimum, you  must review the performance of other bidders in meeting the contract  goal. For example, when the apparent successful bidder fails to meet the  contract goal, but others meet it, you may reasonably raise the question  of whether, with additional efforts, the apparent successful bidder  could have met the goal. If the apparent successful bidder fails to meet  the goal, but meets or exceeds the average DBE participation obtained by  other bidders, you may view this, in conjunction with other factors, as  evidence of the apparent successful bidder having made good faith  efforts. As provided in Sec. 26.53(b)(2)((vi), you must also require  the contractor to submit copies of each DBE and non-DBE subcontractor  quote submitted to the bidder when a non-DBE subcontractor was selected  over a DBE for work on the contract to review whether DBE prices were  substantially higher; and contact the DBEs listed on a contractor's  solicitation to inquire as to whether they were contacted by the prime.  Pro forma mailings to DBEs requesting bids are not alone sufficient to  satisfy good faith efforts under the rule.</p><p class="depth0">VI. A promise to use DBEs after contract award is not considered to  be responsive to the contract solicitation or to constitute good faith  efforts.    [79 FR 59600, Oct. 2, 2014]    Sec.

Your overall goal is to be reported as well as the breakdown for  specific Race Conscious and Race Neutral projections (both of which  include gender-conscious/neutral projections). The Race Conscious  projection should be based on measures that focus on and provide  benefits only for DBEs. The use of contract goals is a primary example  of a race conscious measure. The Race Neutral projection should include  measures that, while benefiting DBEs, are not solely focused on DBE  firms. For example, a small business outreach program, technical  assistance, and prompt payment clauses can assist a wide variety of  businesses in addition to helping DBE firms.</p><p class="depth0">Section A: Awards and Commitments Made During This Period</p><p class="depth0">The amounts in items 8(A)-10(I) should include all types of prime  contracts awarded and all types of subcontracts awarded or committed,  including: professional or consultant services, construction, purchase  of materials or supplies, lease or purchase of equipment and any other  types of services.

The transition management plan should be submitted to the  recipient at the same time other modifications are submitted pursuant to  the annual review under paragraph (E) of this section. The plan should  set forth the same information as required under paragraph (F) of steps  the participant will take to continue its business development after the  expiration of its program term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> When a participant is recognized as successfully completing the  program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives and goals set  forth in its program term, and has demonstrated the ability to compete  in the marketplace, its further participation   within the program may be determined by the recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> In determining whether a concern has substantially achieved the  goals and objectives of its business plan, the following factors, among  others, should be considered by the recipient:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Profitability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sales, including improved ratio of non-traditional contracts to  traditional-type contracts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Net worth, financial ratios, working capital, capitalization,  access to credit and capital;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ability to obtain bonding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A positive comparison of the DBE's business and financial  profile with profiles of non-DBE businesses in the same area or similar  business category; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Good management capacity and capability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Upon determination by the recipient that the participant should  be graduated from the developmental program, the recipient should notify  the participant in writing of its intent to graduate the firm in a  letter of notification. The letter of notification should set forth  findings, based on the facts, for every material issue relating to the  basis of the program graduation with specific reasons for each finding.  The letter of notification should also provide the participant 45 days  from the date of service of the letter to submit in writing information  that would explain why the proposed basis of graduation is not  warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Participation of a DBE firm in the program may be discontinued  by the recipient prior to expiration of the firm's program term for good  cause due to the failure of the firm to engage in business practices  that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time  as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of inadequate  performance or unjustified delinquent performance. Also, the recipient  can discontinue the participation of a firm that does not actively  pursue and bid on contracts, and a firm that, without justification,  regularly fails to respond to solicitations in the type of work it is  qualified for and in the geographical areas where it has indicated  availability under its approved business plan. The recipient should take  such action if over a 2-year period a DBE firm exhibits such a pattern.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix D to Part 26--Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The purpose of this program element is to further the  development of DBEs, including but not limited to assisting them to move  into non-traditional areas of work and/or compete in the marketplace  outside the DBE program, via the provision of training and assistance  from other firms. To operate a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] program, a  recipient must obtain the approval of the concerned operating  administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Any mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] relationship shall be based  on a written development plan, approved by the recipient, which clearly  sets forth the objectives of the parties and their respective roles, the  duration of the arrangement and the services and resources to be  provided by the mentor to the prot[eacute]g[eacute]. The formal mentor- prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement may set a fee schedule to cover the  direct and indirect cost for such services rendered by the mentor for  specific training and assistance to the prot[eacute]g[eacute] through  the life of the agreement. Services provided by the mentor may be  reimbursable under the FTA, FHWA, and FAA programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To be eligible for reimbursement, the mentor's services provided  and associated costs must be directly attributable and properly  allowable to specific individual contracts. The recipient may establish  a line item for the mentor to quote the portion of the fee schedule  expected to be provided during the life of the contract. The amount  claimed shall be verified by the recipient and paid on an incremental  basis representing the time the prot[eacute]g[eacute] is working on the  contract. The total individual contract figures accumulated over the  life of the agreement shall not exceed the amount stipulated in the  original mentor/prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> DBEs involved in a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement must  be independent business entities which meet the requirements for  certification as defined in subpart D of this part. A  prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm must be certified before it begins  participation in a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] arrangement. If the  recipient chooses to recognize mentor/prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements,  it should establish formal general program guidelines. These guidelines  must be submitted to the operating administration for approval prior to  the recipient executing an individual contractor/ subcontractor mentor- prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix E to Part 26--Individual Determinations of Social and</p><p class="depth0">Economic Disadvantage</p><p class="depth0">The following guidance is adapted, with minor modifications, from  SBA regulations concerning social and economic disadvantage  determinations (see 13 CFR 124.103(c) and 124.104).</p><p class="depth0">Social Disadvantage</p><p class="depth0">I. Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been  subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American  society because of their identities as members of groups and without  regard to their individual qualities. Social disadvantage must stem from  circumstances beyond their control. Evidence of individual social   disadvantage must include the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least one objective distinguishing feature that has  contributed to social disadvantage, such as race, ethnic origin, gender,  disability, long-term residence in an environment isolated from the  mainstream of American society, or other similar causes not common to  individuals who are not socially disadvantaged;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social  disadvantage in American society, not in other countries; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Negative impact on entry into or advancement in the business  world because of the disadvantage. Recipients will consider any relevant  evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, recipients  will consider education, employment and business history, where  applicable, to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage  in entering into or advancing in the business world.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Education. Recipients will consider such factors as denial of  equal access to institutions of higher education and vocational  training, exclusion from social and professional association with  students or teachers, denial of educational honors rightfully earned,  and social patterns or pressures which discouraged the individual from  pursuing a professional or business education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employment. Recipients will consider such factors as unequal  treatment in hiring, promotions and other aspects of professional  advancement, pay and fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of  employment; retaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an employer or  labor union; and social patterns or pressures which have channeled the  individual into non-professional or non-business fields.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business history. The recipient will consider such factors as  unequal access to credit or capital, acquisition of credit or capital  under commercially unfavorable circumstances, unequal treatment in  opportunities for government contracts or other work, unequal treatment  by potential customers and business associates, and exclusion from  business or professional organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this appendix, the Department  notes that people with disabilities have disproportionately low incomes  and high rates of unemployment. Many physical and attitudinal barriers  remain to their full participation in education, employment, and  business opportunities available to the general public. The Americans  with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed in recognition of the  discrimination faced by people with disabilities. It is plausible that  many individuals with disabilities--especially persons with severe  disabilities (e.g., significant mobility, vision, or hearing  impairments)--may be socially and economically disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth0">III. Under the laws concerning social and economic disadvantage,  people with disabilities are not a group presumed to be disadvantaged.  Nevertheless, recipients should look carefully at individual showings of  disadvantage by individuals with disabilities, making a case-by-case  judgment about whether such an individual meets the criteria of this  appendix. As public entities subject to Title II of the ADA, recipients  must also ensure their DBE programs are accessible to individuals with  disabilities. For example, physical barriers or the lack of application  and information materials in accessible formats cannot be permitted to  thwart the access of potential applicants to the certification process  or other services made available to DBEs and applicants.</p><p class="depth0">Economic Disadvantage</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially  disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free  enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit  opportunities as compared to others in the same or similar line of  business who are not socially disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Submission of narrative and financial information. (1) Each  individual claiming economic disadvantage must describe the conditions  which are the basis for the claim in a narrative statement, and must  submit personal financial information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Factors to be considered. In considering diminished capital and  credit opportunities, recipients will examine factors relating to the  personal financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged  status, including personal income for the past two years (including  bonuses and the value of company stock given in lieu of cash), personal  net worth, and the fair market value of all assets, whether encumbered  or not. Recipients will also consider the financial condition of the  applicant compared to the financial profiles of small businesses in the  same primary industry classification, or, if not available, in similar  lines of business, which are not owned and controlled by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals in evaluating the individual's  access to credit and capital. The financial profiles that recipients  will compare include total assets, net sales, pre-tax profit, sales/ working capital ratio, and net worth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(2)</em> of this appendix, recipients will attribute to an individual  claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has  transferred to an immediate family member, or to a trust, a beneficiary  of which is an immediate family member, for less than fair market value,   within two years prior to a concern's application for participation in  the DBE program, unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can  demonstrate that the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family  member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other  form of essential support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recipients will not attribute to an individual claiming  disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an  immediate family member that are consistent with the customary  recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations,  anniversaries, and retirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In determining an individual's access to capital and credit,  recipients may consider any assets that the individual transferred  within such two-year period described by paragraph (D)(1) of this  appendix that are not considered in evaluating the individual's assets  and net worth (e.g., transfers to charities).
