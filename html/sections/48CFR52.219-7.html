                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 19.508(d), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Notice of Partial Small Business Set-Aside (JUN 2003)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Small business concern, as used in this clause, means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in this solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. (1) A portion of this requirement, identified elsewhere in this solicitation, has been set aside for award to one or more small business concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A portion of this requirement, identified elsewhere in this solicitation, has been set aside for award to one or more small business concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Offers on the non-set-aside portion will be evaluated first and award will be made on that portion in accordance with the provisions of this solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The set-aside portion will be awarded at the highest unit price(s) in the contract(s) for the non-set-aside portion, adjusted to reflect transportation and other costs appropriate for the selected contractor(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contractor(s) for the set-aside portion will be selected from among the small business concerns that submitted responsive offers on the non-set-aside portion. Negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside portion. If the negotiations are not successful or if only part of the set-aside portion is awarded to that concern, negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the second-lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside portion. This process will continue until a contract or contracts are awarded for the entire set-aside portion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agreement. For the set-aside portion of the acquisition, a small business concern submitting an offer in its own name shall furnish, in performing the contract, only end items manufactured or produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas. If this procurement is processed under simplified acquisition procedures and the total amount of this contract does not exceed $25,000, a small business concern may furnish the product of any domestic firm. This paragraph does not apply to construction or service contracts.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth2">Alternate I (OCT 1995). When the acquisition is for a product in a class for which the Small Business Administration has determined that there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market in accordance with 19.502-2(c), delete paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth2">Alternate II (MAR 2004). As prescribed in 19.508(d), add the following paragraph (d) to the basic clause:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this clause, offers from Federal Prison Industries, Inc., will be solicited and considered for both the set-aside and non-set-aside portion of this requirement.
