                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan commitments listed below were submitted on the dates specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On April 20, 1994, Ohio submitted Rule 3745-35-07, entitled ``Federally Enforceable Limitations on Potential to Emit,'' and requested authority to issue such limitations as conditions in State operating permits. On June 16, 1994, Ohio submitted a commitment to revise Rule 3745-35-07 to clarify that the rule provides for USEPA objection to permits after issuance. The revisions are approved provided Ohio fulfills this commitment by October 25, 1995.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Rule 3745-35-07, adopted April 4, 1994, effective April 20, 1994.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conditional Approval--On August 17, 1995, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation of the federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T--Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act. This conditional approval is based, in part, on the State's commitment, submitted in a letter on April 1, 1996, to submit revised transportation conformity rules to incorporate the two amendments to the federal transportation conformity regulations. The State of Ohio committed to revise its transportation conformity rules by November 14, 1996. If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment to meet these requirements within one year of final conditional approval, then USEPA's action for the State's requested SIP revision will automatically convert to a final disapproval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference. August 1, 1995, Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 3745-101, effective August 21, 1995.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On March 1, 1996, Ohio submitted revisions to its Permit to Install rules as a revision to the State implementation plan. The request was supplemented on April 16, 1997, September 5, 1997, December 4, 1997, and April 21, 1998.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Rule 3745-31-01 through 3745-31-20, effective September 25, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On October 9, 2000, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted a revision to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 3745-21-09(BBB). The revision removed a requirement that for the agerite resin D process, the VOC emissions from the vapor recovery system vents and neutralization and distillation system vents (except wash kettle or still feed condenser vents, stills vacuum jet tailpipe vents, and process emergency safety relief devices) be vented to an emissions control device that is designed and operated to achieve an emissions control efficiency of at least 90 percent, by weight. In place of this deleted emissions control efficiency requirement, the revised paragraph now specifies a total annual VOC emissions limit of 1.0 ton from the recovery system and neutralization and distillation system vents. The revision lacked test procedures and record keeping requirements compatible with the revised emission limit. On March 1, 2010, Ohio submitted

a commitment to revise OAC 3745-21-09(BBB) to include the necessary test procedures and record keeping requirements by September 16, 2011. When EPA determines the state has met its commitment, OAC 3745-21-09(BBB) will be incorporated by reference into the SIP.
