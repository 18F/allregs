                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inability to locate debtor. The Administrator may suspend  collection on a debt where he determines that the debtor cannot be  located presently but that there is a reasonable belief that the debtor  can be located in the future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial condition of debtor. The Administrator may suspend  collection action on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity  in real or personal property and is unable to make payment on the claim  or effect a compromise but the debtor's future financial prospects  justify retention of the claim for periodic review, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable statute of limitations will not expire during the  period of the suspension, can be tolled or has started running anew;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the  10-year statute of limitations for administrative offsets; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is  likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount  of the debt with interest at a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for waiver or administrative review--mandatory. The  Administrator will suspend collection activity where a statute provides  for mandatory waiver consideration or administrative review prior to  agency collection of a debt. The Administrator will suspend EPA's  collection actions during the period provided for the debtor to request  review or waiver and during the period of the Agency's evaluation of the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for waiver or administrative review--permissive. The  Administrator may suspend collection activities on debts of $20,000 or  less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review  where he determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted  and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is  granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if  the debtor does not prevail; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refund barred by statute or regulation. The Administrator will  ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of his  consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute  and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should  the debtor prevail. The Administrator may decline to suspend collection  where he determines that the request for waiver or administrative review  is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.</p>
