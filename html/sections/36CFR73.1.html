The rules describe the procedures used to implement the Convention under  the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980. The purpose  of the World Heritage Convention is to enhance worldwide understanding  and appreciation of heritage conservation, and to recognize and preserve  natural and cultural properties throughout the world that have  outstanding universal value to mankind.</p>
