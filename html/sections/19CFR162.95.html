                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> is entitled to  immediate release of the property if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant has a possessory interest in the property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide  assurance that the property will be available at the time of trial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The continued possession of the property by Customs pending the  final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial  hardship to the claimant, such as preventing an individual from working,  or leaving an individual homeless; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by  Customs of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will  be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned  to the claimant during the pendency of the proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. Immediate release of seized property under paragraph  (a) of this section will not apply if the seized property:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is contraband, currency or other monetary instrument, or  electronic funds, unless, in the case of currency, other monetary  instrument or electronic funds, such property comprises the assets of a  legitimate business which has been seized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is to be used as evidence of a violation of the law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By reason of design or other characteristic, is particularly  suited for use in illegal activities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if  returned to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for release. A claimant seeking release of property  under this section must request possession of the property from the  Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer who issued the notice of  seizure. The request need not be made in any particular form, but must  be in writing and set forth the basis on which the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section have been met. The request may be filed at  any time during which the property remains under seizure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Granting request for release. The Fines, Penalties, and  Forfeitures Officer may release the property if it is determined to be  appropriate under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of or failure to act on request for release. If the  Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer denies the request for release  or fails to make a decision on the request by the 15th calendar day  after the date the request is received by Customs, the claimant may file  a petition in the district court in which the complaint has been filed,  or, if no complaint has been filed, in the U.S. district court in which  the seizure warrant was issued or in the U.S. district court for the  district in which the property was seized.
