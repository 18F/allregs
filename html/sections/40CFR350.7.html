                                Sec. 350.7  Substantiating claims of trade secrecy.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claims of trade secrecy must be substantiated by providing a  specific answer including, where applicable, specific facts, to each of  the following questions with the submission to which the trade secrecy  claim pertains. Submitters must answer these questions on the form  entitled ``Substantiation to Accompany Claims of Trade Secrecy'' in  Sec. 350.27 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the specific measures you have taken to safeguard the  confidentiality of the chemical identity claimed as trade secret, and  indicate whether these measures will continue in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have you disclosed the information claimed as trade secret to  any other person (other than a member of a local emergency planning  committee, officer or employee of the United States or a State or local  government, or your employee) who is not bound by a confidentiality  agreement to refrain from disclosing this trade secret information to  others?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> List all local, State, and Federal government entities to which  you have disclosed the specific chemical identity. For each, indicate  whether you asserted a confidentiality claim for the chemical identity  and whether the government entity denied that claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In order to show the validity of a trade secrecy claim, you must  identify your specific use of the chemical claimed as trade secret and  explain why it is a secret of interest to competitors. Therefore:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describe the specific use of the chemical claimed as trade  secret, identifying the product or process in which it is used. (If you  use the chemical other than as a component of a product or in a  manufacturing process, identify the activity where the chemical is  used.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has your company or facility identity been linked to the  specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret in a patent, or in  publications or other information sources available to the public or  your competitors (of which you are aware)? If so, explain why this  knowledge does not eliminate the justification for trade secrecy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If this use of the chemical claimed as trade secret is unknown  outside your company, explain how your competitors could deduce this use  from disclosure of the chemical identity together with other information  on the Title III submittal form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Explain why your use of the chemical claimed as trade secret  would be valuable information to your competitors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Indicate the nature of the harm to your competitive position  that would likely result from disclosure of the specific chemical  identity, and indicate why such harm would be substantial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To what extent is the chemical claimed as trade secret  available to the public or your competitors in products, articles, or  environmental releases?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe the factors which influence the cost of determining  the identity of the chemical claimed as trade secret by chemical  analysis of the product, article, or waste which contains the chemical  (e.g., whether the chemical is in pure form or is mixed with other  substances).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The answers to the substantiation questions listed in paragraph  (a) of this section are to be submitted on the form   in Sec. 350.27 of this subpart, and included with a submitter's trade  secret claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An owner, operator or senior official with management  responsibility shall sign the certification at the end of the form  contained in Sec. 350.27. The certification in both the sanitized and  unsanitized versions of the substantiation must bear an original  signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Claims of confidentiality in the substantiation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or confidential  business information contained in the substantiation. Such claims for  material in the substantiation are not limited to claims of trade  secrecy for specific chemical identity, but may also include claims of  confidentiality for any confidential business information. To claim this  material as confidential, the submitter shall clearly designate those  portions of the substantiation to be claimed as confidential by marking  those portions ``Confidential,'' or ``Trade Secret.'' Information not so  marked will be treated as public and may be disclosed without notice to  the submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An owner, operator, or senior official with management  responsibility shall sign the certification stating that those portions  of the substantiation claimed as confidential would, if disclosed,  reveal the chemical identity being claimed as a trade secret, or would  reveal other confidential business or trade secret information. This  certification is combined on the substantiation form in Sec. 350.27  with the certification described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the  substantiation, one of which shall be the unsanitized version, and the  other shall be the sanitized version.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unsanitized copy shall contain all of the information  claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized  substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all  of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be  deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the  substantiation is the chemical identity which is the subject of the  substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate generic  class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret. This  sanitized copy shall be submitted to the State emergency response  commission, a designated State agency, the local emergency planning  committee and the local fire department, as appropriate, and made  publicly available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Supplemental information. (1) EPA may request supplemental  information from the submitter in support of its trade secret claim,  pursuant to Sec. 350.11(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. EPA may specify the kind of information  to be submitted, or the submitter may submit any additional detailed  information which further supports the truth of the information  previously supplied to EPA in its initial substantiation, under this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or  confidential business information contained in the supplemental  information. To claim this material as confidential, the submitter shall  clearly designate those portions of the supplemental information to be  claimed as confidential by marking those portions ``Confidential,'' or  ``Trade Secret.'' Information not so marked will be treated as public  and may be disclosed without notice to the submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If portions of the supplementary information are claimed  confidential, an owner, operator, or senior official with management  responsibility of the submitter shall certify that those portions of the  supplemental information claimed as confidential would, if disclosed,  reveal the chemical identity being claimed as confidential or would  reveal other confidential business or trade secret information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If supplemental information is requested by EPA and the  submitter claims portions of it as trade secret or confidential, then  the submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the supplemental  information, an unsanitized and a sanitized version.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unsanitized version shall contain all of the information  claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated  above in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized  substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all  of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be  deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the  supplemental information is the chemical identity which is the subject  of the substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate  generic class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret.</p>
