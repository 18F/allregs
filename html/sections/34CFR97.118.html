                            <p class="depth0">Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or  contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge  that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite  plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal.  These include activities such as institutional type grants when  selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility;  research training grants in which the activities involving subjects  remain to be selected; and projects in which human subject's involvement  will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or  purification of compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an  IRB before an award may be made. However, except for research exempted  or waived under Sec. 97.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be  involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has  been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and  certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or  agency.
