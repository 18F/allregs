Characteristics of reasonable expectation include that it:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Requires less than absolute proof because absolute proof is impossible to attain for disposal due to the uncertainty of projecting long-term performance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Accounts for the inherently greater uncertainties in making long-term projections of the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Does not exclude important parameters from assessments and analyses simply because they are difficult to precisely quantify to a high degree of confidence; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Focuses performance assessments and analyses on the full range of defensible and reasonable parameter distributions rather than only upon extreme physical situations and parameter values.</p>
