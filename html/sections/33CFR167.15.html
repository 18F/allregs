Adjustment may be in the form of a temporary traffic lane shift, a  temporary suspension of a section of the scheme, a temporary  precautionary area overlaying a lane, or other appropriate measure.  Adjustments will only be made where, in the judgment of the Coast Guard,  there is no reasonable alternative means of conducting an operation and  navigation safety will not be jeopardized by the adjustment. Notice of  adjustments will be made in the appropriate Notice to Mariners and in  the Federal Register. Requests by members of the public for temporary  adjustments to traffic separation schemes must be submitted 150 days  prior to the time the adjustment is desired. Such Requests, describing  the interference that would otherwise occur to a TSS, should be  submitted to the District Commander of the Coast Guard District in which  the TSS is located.</p>
