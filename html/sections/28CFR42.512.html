When a test is administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results must accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</p>
