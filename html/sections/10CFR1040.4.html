                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assurances. An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance on a form specified by the Director that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with applicable subparts. Such assurances are to include provisions which give the United States a right to seek judicial enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structure on the property, the assurance obligates the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance obligates the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In all other cases, the assurance obligates the recipient to all terms and conditions contained in the certificate of assurance for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Covenants. Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property, structures, improvements on or interests in the property, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest in the property from the Department:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The instrument effecting or recording this transfer is to contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where no transfer of property is involved or imposed with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant is to also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a material breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property manages to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new or improvement of existing facilities on the property for the purpose for which the property was transferred, the Director may, upon request of the transferee and, if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions, as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of the right to revert title for so long as the lien of the mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assurances from government agencies. In the case of any application from any department, agency or office of any State or local government for Federal financial assistance for any specified purpose, the assurance required by this section is to extend to any other department, agency, or office of the same governmental unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assurance from academic and other institutions. (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance for any purpose to an academic institution, the assurance required by this

section is to extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The assurance required with respect to an academic institution, detention or correctional facility, or any other institution or facility, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, wards, inmates, persons subject to control, or clients of the institution or facility or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services, disposition, treatment, or benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution or facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Continuing Federal financial assistance. Any State or State agency applying for continuing Federal financial assistance subject to this part shall, as a condition for the extension of such assistance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide a statement that the program or activity is (or, in the case of a new program or activity, will be) conducted in compliance with applicable subparts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide for such methods of administration as are found by the Director or a designee to give reasonable assurance that the primary recipient and all other recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Assistance for construction. Where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility, or a part of a facility, the assurance is to extend to the entire facility. If a facility to be constructed is part of a larger system, the assurance is to extend to the larger system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Pre-award review. Prior to and as a condition of approval, all applications for Federal financial assistance are to be reviewed by the appropriate Civil Rights Department official who is to make a written determination of the applicant's compliance with this part. The basis for such a determination is to be the submission of the assurance of compliance as specified in paragraph (a) and a review of data to be submitted by the applicant as specified by the Director. For purposes of this subsection, the appropriate departmental official at headquarters level is the Director, FAPD, Office of Equal Opportunity, and at the regional level it is to be the Civil Rights Officer delegated by the Director as having review authority for determining compliance with requirements of this part. Where a determination of compliance cannot be made from this data, DOE may require the applicant to submit necessary additional information and may take other steps necessary to make the determination of compliance. Such other steps may include, for example, communicating with local government officials or protected class organizations and field reviews. Any agreement to achieve voluntary compliance as a result of a preaward review shall be in writing. In the case of Title VI, the Director will notify the Assistant Attorney General of instances of probable noncompliance determined as the result of application reviews. The opportunity for a hearing as provided under Sec. 1040.113 is applicable to this section.
