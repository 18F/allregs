                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mortgagee to provide disclosure notice. A mortgagee must provide  a prospective FHA mortgagor with an informed consumer choice disclosure  notice if, in the mortgagees's judgment, the prospective FHA mortgagor  may qualify for similar conventional mortgage products offered by the  mortgagee. The mortgagee should base this judgment on the mortgagee's  initial assessment of the prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a  conventional mortgage product. If a mortgagee is unsure about a  prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a conventional mortgage  product, the mortgagee should provide the prospective FHA mortgagor with  an informed consumer choice disclosure notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Informed consumer choice disclosure notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contents of  notice. The informed consumer choice disclosure notice must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide a one page generic analysis comparing the mortgage costs  of an FHA-insured mortgage with the mortgage costs of similar  conventional mortgage products offered by the mortgagee that the  prospective FHA mortgagor may qualify for;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide information about when the requirement to pay FHA  mortgage insurance premiums terminates; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meet the requirements of section 203(b)(2) of the National  Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>. The model informed consumer choice disclosure notice  contains the minimum elements of an informed consumer choice disclosure  notice. These elements must be included in a mortgagee's informed  consumer choice disclosure notice. A mortgagee, however, may include  additional elements in an informed consumer choice disclosure notice to  better reflect the mortgagee's products or to provide information that  the mortgagee believes is meaningful and helpful to the mortgagee's  customers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Availability of model disclosure notice. HUD's model informed  consumer choice disclosure notice is made available to FHA-approved  mortgagees through Mortgagee Letter and is available to the public  through the internet at HUD's web site at http://www.hud.gov or by  contacting: Home Mortgage Insurance Division, Office of Insured Single  Family Housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451  Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410-8000; telephone (202) 708-2700  (this is not a toll-free number), or the nearest HUD Homeownership  Center (Atlanta, GA (888) 696-4687; Denver, CO (800) 543-9378;  Philadelphia, PA (800) 440-8647; or Santa Ana, CA (888) 827-   5605).

When required under paragraph (a) of this section, a  mortgagee must provide an informed consumer choice disclosure notice to  a prospective FHA mortgagor not later than three business days after the  mortgagee receives the prospective FHA mortgagor's application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revision of notice. A mortgagee should revise its informed  consumer choice disclosure notice periodically to reflect prevailing  market conditions. To ensure that the informed consumer choice  disclosure notice reflects prevailing market conditions, a mortgagee  must revise its informed consumer choice disclosure notice at least once  annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicability. This section applies to any application for  mortgage insurance authorized under section 203(b) of the National  Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709) that the mortgagee receives on or after  September 2, 1999.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definitions. As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2">Application means the submission of financial information in  anticipation of a credit decision.</p><p class="depth2">Conventional mortgage means conventional mortgage as used in section  305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C.  1454(a)(2)) or section 302(b)(2) of the Federal National Mortgage  Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1717(b)(2)), as applicable.</p><p class="depth2">Mortgagee means mortgagee as defined in Sec. 202.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Prospective FHA mortgagor means a person who submits an application  to a mortgagee to obtain mortgage insurance authorized under section  203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709).
