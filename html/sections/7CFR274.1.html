FNS and USDA OIG reserve the right to conduct other reviews or audits if necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> EBT services provided directly by the State are not subject to SAS No. 70 examination requirements of this section but remain subject to the single audit requirements at 7 CFR 277.7 and OMB Circular A-133.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compliance Investigations. State agencies shall provide on-line read-only access to State EBT systems for compliance investigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency is required to provide software and telecommunications capability as necessary to FNS Retailer Investigation Branch Area offices, Regional offices and Field offices so that FNS compliance investigators, other appropriate FNS personnel and USDA OIG investigators have access to the system in order to conduct investigations of program abuse and alleged violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency must ensure that FNS compliance investigators and USDA OIG investigators have access to EBT cards and accounts that are updated as necessary to conduct SNAP investigations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Federal financial participation. (1) The cost of administering statewide benefit issuance after implementation of the EBT system shall be funded at the regular Federal financial participation rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of administering statewide benefit issuance after implementation of the EBT system shall be funded at the regular Federal financial participation rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall comply with the provisions set forth under Sec. 277.18 of this chapter and OMB Circular A-87 (available on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default/) in determining and claiming allowable costs for the EBT system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Access to system documentation, including cost records of contractors or subcontractors shall be made available and incorporated into contractual agreements in accordance with Sec. 277.18(k) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State agencies may receive one hundred percent Federal funding for the costs they incur for switching and settling all SNAP interstate transactions. For purposes of this section, the term ``switching'' means the routing of an interstate transaction that consists of transmitting the details of a transaction electronically recorded through the use of an EBT card in one State to the issuer of the card that is in another State; and the term ``settling'' means movement, and reporting such movement, of funds from an EBT card issuer located in one State to a retail food store, or wholesale food concern, that is located in another State, to accomplish an interstate transaction. The total amount of one hundred percent funding available annually is limited to $500,000 nationwide. Once the $500,000 limitation is exceeded, Federal financial participation reverts to the standard fifty percent program reimbursement rate and procedure. To qualify for this funding, the State agency must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meet standards of interoperability and portability under Sec. 274.8;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sign and submit, in each fiscal year for which the State agency requests enhanced funding, an Interoperability Funding Agreement to comply with the administrative procedures established by the Department. The State agency must submit the signed agreement to the Department before the end of the fiscal year in which costs are incurred in order to qualify for payment for that fiscal year, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit requests for payment on a quarterly basis after the end of the quarter in which interoperability costs are incurred, in accordance with the Department's administrative procedures. Requests for payments shall be due February 15 (for the period October through December), May 15 (January through March), August 15 (April

through June), and November 15 (July through September). Requests for payment submitted after the required date for a quarter shall not be considered until the following quarter, when such requests for payments are scheduled to be processed.
