Upon the receipt of each shipment, the receiver shall complete the applicable portion of the form and return one copy to the committee within 10 days and one copy shall be retained by the shipper. Such completion shall contain a certification to the Secretary and the committee that the citrus described shall be distributed in the outlets described.
