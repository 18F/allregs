                            <p class="depth0">The State Director may authorize all or part of a facility to be operated, maintained or managed by a third party under a contract, management agreement, written lease, or other third party agreement as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Leases--(1) Lease of all or part of a facility (except when liquidation action is pending). The State Director may consent to the leasing of all or a portion of security property when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lease of all or part of a facility (except when liquidation action is pending). The State Director may consent to the leasing of all or a portion of security property when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Leasing is the only feasible way to provide the service and is the customary practice as required under Sec. 1942.17(b)(4) of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower retains ultimate responsibility for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility and for its continued availability and use at reasonable rates and terms as required under Sec. 1942.17(b)(4) of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter. The lease agreement must clearly reflect sufficient control by the borrower over the operation, maintenance, and management of the facility to assure that the borrower maintains this responsibility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The lease agreement contains provisions prohibiting any amendments to the lease or any subleasing arrangements without prior written approval from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The lease document contains nondiscrimination requirements as set forth in Sec. 1951.204 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The lease contains a provision which recognizes that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is a lienholder on the subject facility and, as such, the lease is subordinate to the rights and claims of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as lienholder; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The lease does not constitute a lease/purchase arrangement, unless permitted under Sec. 1951.232 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lease of all or part of a facility (pending liquidation action). The State Director may consent to the leasing of all or a portion of security property when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lease will not adversely affect the repayment of the loan or the Government's rights under the security or other instruments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State Director has determined that liquidation will likely be necessary and the lease is necessary until liquidation can be accomplished;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Leasing is not an alternative to, or means of delaying, liquidation action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The lease and use of any proceeds from the lease will further the objective of the loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Rental income is assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in an amount sufficient to make regular payments on the loan and operate and maintain the facility unless such payments are otherwise adequately secured;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The lease is advantageous to the borrower and is not disadvantageous to the Government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If foreclosure action has been approved and the case has been submitted to OGC, consent to lease and use of proceeds will be granted only with OGC's concurrence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The lease does not exceed a one-year period. The property may not be under lease more than two consecutive years without authorization from the National Office. Long-term leases may be approved, with prior authorization from the National Office, if necessary to ensure the continuation of services for which the loan was made and if other servicing options contained in this subpart have been determined inappropriate for servicing the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mineral leases. Unless liquidation is pending, the State Director is authorized to approve mineral leases when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lessee agrees, or is liable without any agreement, to pay adequate compensation for any damage to the real estate surface and improvements. Damage compensation will be assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the prior lienholder by the use of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 443-16, ``Assignment of Income from Real Estate Security,'' or other appropriate instrument;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Royalty payments are adequate and are assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 443-16 in an amount determined by the State Director to be adequate to protect the Government's interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All or a portion of delay rentals and bonus payments may be assigned on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 443-16 if needed for protection of the Government's interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lease, subordination, or consent form is acceptable to OGC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The lease will not interfere with the purpose for which the loan or grant was made; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 consent is required, the borrower submits a completed Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 465-1. The form will include the terms of the proposed agreement and specify the use of all proceeds, including any to be released to the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Management agreements. Management agreements should contain the minimum suggested contents contained in Guide 24 of part 1942, subpart A of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Affiliation agreements. An affiliation agreement between the borrower and a third party may be approved by the State Director, with OGC concurrence, if it provides for shared services between the parties and does not result

in changes to the borrower's legal organizational structure which would result in its loss of control over its assets and/or over the operation, management, and maintenance of the facility to the extent that it cannot carry out its responsibilities as set forth in Sec. 1942.17(b)(4) of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter. However, affiliation agreements which result in a loss of borrower control may be approved with prior concurrence of the Administrator if the loan is reclassified as a nonprogram loan and the borrower is notified that it is no longer eligible for any program benefit. Requests forwarded to the Administrator will contain the case file, the proposed affiliation agreement, and necessary supporting information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Processing. The consent of other lienholders will be obtained when required. When National Office approval is required, or if the State Director wishes to have a transaction reviewed prior to approval, the case file will be forwarded to the National Office and will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the proposed agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exhibit A of this subpart (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office), appropriately completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other necessary supporting information.
