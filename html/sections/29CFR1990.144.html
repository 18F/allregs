                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Arguments on the following issues will be considered by the  Secretary in identifying or classifying any substance pursuant to this  part, if evidence for the specific substance subject to the rulemaking  conforms to the following criteria. Such arguments and evidence will be  evaluated based upon scientific and policy judgments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-positive results obtained in human epidemiologic studies.  Non-positive results obtained in human epidemiologic studies regarding  the substance subject to the rulemaking or to a similar or closely  related substance will be considered by the Secretary only if they meet  the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The epidemiologic study involved at least 20 years'  exposure of a group of subjects to the substance and at least 30 years'  observation of the subjects after initial exposure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Documented reasons are provided for predicting the site(s) at  which the substance would induce cancer if it were carcinogenic in  humans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The group of exposed subjects was large enough for an increase  in cancer incidence of 50% above that in unexposed controls to have been  detected at any of the predicted sites.   Arguments that non-positive results obtained in human epidemiologic  studies should be used to establish numerical upper limits on potential  risks to humans exposed to specific levels of a substance will be  considered only if criteria (i) and (ii) are met and, in addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Specific data on the level of exposure of the group of workers  are provided, based either on direct measurements made periodically  throughout the period of exposure, or upon other data which provide  reliable evidence of the magnitude of exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tumors induced at site of administration. Arguments that tumors  at the site of administration should not be considered will be  considered only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The route of administration is not oral, respiratory or dermal;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence is provided which establishes that induction of local  tumors is related to the physical configuration or formulation of the  material administered (e.g., crystalline form or dimensions of a solid  material, or matrix of an impregnated implant) and that tumors are not  induced when the same material is administered in a different  configuration or formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Metabolic differences. Arguments that differences in metabolic  profiles can be used to demonstrate that a chemical found positive in an  experimental study in a mammalian species would pose no potential  carcinogenic risk to exposed workers will be considered by the Secretary  only if the evidence presented for the specific substance subject to the  rulemaking meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A complete metabolic profile, including identities of  trace metabolites, is presented for the experimental animal species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A complete metabolic profile, including identities of trace  metabolites, is available for a human population group representative of  those who are occupationally exposed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Documented evidence is provided for ascribing the carcinogenic  activity of the substance in the test animal species to metabolite(s)  produced only in that species and not in humans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Documented evidence is provided to show that other metabolites  produced also in humans have been adequately tested and have not been  shown to be carcinogenic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of high doses in animal testing. Arguments that positive  results obtained in carcinogenesis bioassays with experimental animals  subjected to high doses of a substance are not relevant to potential  carcinogenic risks to exposed workers will be considered by the  Secretary only if the evidence for the specific substance subject to the  rulemaking meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Documented evidence is presented to show that the  substance in question is metabolized by the experimental animal species  exposed at the dose levels used in the bioassay(s) to metabolic products  which include one or more that are not produced in the same species at  lower doses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Documented evidence is presented to show that the metabolite(s)  produced only at high doses in the experimental animal species are the  ultimate carcinogen(s) and that the metabolites produced at low doses  are not also carcinogenic; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Documented evidence is presented to show that the  metabolite(s) produced only at high doses in the experimental animal  species are not produced in humans exposed to low doses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Benign tumors. The Secretary will consider evidence that the  substance subject to the rulemaking proceeding is capable only of  inducing benign tumors in humans or experimental animals provided that  the evidence for the specific substance meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Data are available from at least two well-conducted  bioassays in each of two species of mammals (or from equivalent evidence  in more than two species);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Each of the bioassays to be considered has been conducted for  the full lifetime of the experimental animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The relevant tissue slides are made available to OSHA or its  designee and the diagnoses of the tumors as benign are made by at least  one qualified pathologist who has personally examined each of the slides  and who provides specific diagnostic criteria and descriptions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> All of the induced tumors must be shown to belong to a type  which is known not to progress to malignancy or to be at a benign stage  when observed. In the latter case, data must be presented to show that  multiple sections of the affected organ(s)   were adequately examined to search for invasion of the tumor cells into  adjacent tissue, and that multiple sections of other organs were  adequately examined to search for tumor metastases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Indirect mechanisms. The Secretary will consider evidence that  positive results obtained in a carcinogenesis bioassay with experimental  animals are not relevant to a determination of a carcinogenic risk to  exposed workers, if the evidence demonstrates that the mechanism by  which the observed tumor incidence is effected is indirect and would not  occur if humans were exposed. As examples, evidence will be considered  that a substance causes a carcinogenic effect by augmenting caloric  intake or that the carcinogenic effect from exposure to a substance is  demonstrated to be the result of the presence of a carcinogenic virus  and it is demonstrated that, in either case, the effect would not take  place in the absence of the particular carcinogenic virus or the  augmented caloric intake.
