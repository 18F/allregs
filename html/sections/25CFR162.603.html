                                Sec. 162.603  San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112),  provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and  Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Arizona, in addition to that  contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25  U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier  or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in part 162  apply. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for  implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 Act does not apply to leases  made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining leases  on Indian lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of leases. Leases made under the 1966 Act for public,  religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes  may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing  lease shall not exceed ten years; the term of a farming lease that does  not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of  the land shall not exceed ten years; and the term of a farming lease  that requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement  of the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option  to renew which extends the total term beyond the maximum term permitted  by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required covenant and enforcement thereof. Every lease under the  1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will  not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a  nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property  wherever such persons or property may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification regarding leasing proposals. If the Secretary  determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for  public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business  purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a  municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River  Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the  appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the  proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such  municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which  affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on   the terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of  such terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to  the authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period,  not to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicability of other regulations. The regulations in part 162  of this title shall apply to leases made under the 1966 Act except where  such regulations are inconsistent with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Mission San Xavier del Bac. Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes  development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious  values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order  of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.
