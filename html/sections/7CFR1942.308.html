                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grants are sometimes made by Federal Regional Commissions for

projects eligible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has agreed to administer such funds in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations and the requirements of the commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transfer of funds from a Regional Commission to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be based on specific applications determined to be eligible for an authorized purpose in accordance with the requirements of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Regional Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ARC is authorized under the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (40 U.S.C. 1-405), as amended, to serve the Appalachian region. ARC grants are handled in accordance with the ARC Agreement which applies to all ARC grants administered by the Agency. Therefore, a separate Project Management Agreement between the Agency and ARC is not needed for each ARC grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other Federal Regional Commissions are those authorized under title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Grants by these commissions are handled in accordance with a separate Project Management Agreement between the respective Regional Commission and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for each Commission grant administered by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (Guide 1 of this subpart). The agreement should be prepared by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director and the appropriate Commission official when the State Director receives a notice from the Commission of the amount of the grant to be made.
