Whenever the quality assurance procedures in Sec. 98.394(a) cannot be followed to measure the quantity of one or more petroleum products, natural gas liquids, types of biomass, feedstocks, or crude oil during any period (e.g., if a meter malfunctions), the following missing data procedures shall be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For quantities of a product that are purchased or sold, a period of missing data shall be substituted using a reporter's established procedures for billing purposes in that period as agreed to by the party selling or purchasing the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For quantities of a product that are not purchased or sold but of which the custody is transferred, a period of missing data shall be substituted using a reporter's established procedures for tracking purposes in that period as agreed to by the party involved in custody transfer of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of emission factor. Whenever any of the procedures in Sec. 98.394(c) cannot be followed to develop an emission factor for any reason, Calculation Method 1 of this subpart must be used in place of Calculation Method 2 of this subpart for the entire reporting year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of API gravity and sulfur content of crude oil. For missing data on sulfur content or API gravity, the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of API gravity or sulfur content in the batch preceding and the batch immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured values for API gravity and sulfur content obtained from the batch after the missing data period.
