                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) that provides supported service within the study area of a price cap local exchange carrier shall receive Interstate Access Universal Service Support for each line that it serves within that study area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any study area within which the price cap local exchange carrier has not established state approved geographically deaveraged rates for UNE loops, the Administrator shall calculate the Interstate Access Universal Service Support Per Line by dividing Study Area Access Universal Service

Support by twelve times all eligible telecommunications carriers' base period lines in that study area adjusted for growth during the relevant support period based on the average nationwide annual growth in eligible lines during the three previous years. For the purpose of calculating growth, the Administrator shall use a simple average of annual growth rates for total switched access lines for the three most recent years as reported in the Common Carrier Bureau Report, Statistics of Communications Common Carriers, Table 6.10--Selected Operating Statistics. Interested parties may obtain this report from the U.S. Government Printing Office or by downloading it from the Federal Communication Commission's website http://www.fcc.gov/ccb/stats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any study area within which the price cap local exchange carrier has established state approved geographically deaveraged rates for UNE loops, the Administrator shall calculate the Interstate Access Universal Service Support Per Line for each customer class and zone using all eligible telecommunications carriers' base period lines by customer class and zone adjusted for growth during the relevant support period based on the average nationwide annual growth in eligible lines during the three previous years. For the purpose of calculating growth, the Administrator shall use a simple average of annual growth rates for total switched access lines for the three most recent years as reported in the Wireline Competition Bureau Report, Statistics of Communications Common Carriers, Table 6.10--Selected Operating Statistics. Support shall be allocated to lines in the highest cost UNE zone first, and will ``cascade'' to lines in lower cost UNE zones to the extent that sufficient funding is available. Beginning with the zone with the highest Zone Average Revenue Per Line, support will be applied in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To all lines in the highest zone, to eliminate the amount per line by which Zone Average Revenue Per Line exceeds the higher of $9.20 or the Average Revenue Per Line in the next highest zone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Zone Average Revenue Per Line in the next highest zone is greater than $9.20, then to all lines in both zones to eliminate the amount per line by which Zone Average Revenue per Line exceeds $9.20 or the Zone Average Revenue Per Line in the third highest zone. This application of support will continue to additional zones in the same fashion until the amount per line by which Zone Average Revenue Per Line exceeds $9.20 has been eliminated in all zones, or until the available support has been exhausted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To all residential and single-line business lines in the highest zone, to eliminate the remaining amount per line that Zone Average Revenue Per Line for these lines exceeds the higher of $7.00 or Zone Average Revenue Per Line in the next highest zone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Zone Average Revenue per Line in the next highest zone is greater than $7.00, then to all residential and single-line business lines in both zones to eliminate the remaining amount per line by which Zone Average Revenue Per Line exceeds $7.00. This application of support will continue to additional zones in the same fashion until the difference between Zone Average Revenue Per Line and $7.00 has been eliminated in all zones, or until the available support has been exhausted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 54.307(a)(2), the per-line support amount determined within each zone by applicable customer class under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is portable among all eligible telecommunications carriers providing service within that zone.
