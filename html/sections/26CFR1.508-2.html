No gift or bequest made to an organization upon which  the tax provided by section 507(c) has been imposed shall be allowed as  a deduction under section 170, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 2055,   2106(a)(2), or 2522, if such gift or bequest is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By any person after notification has been made by the  organization under section 507(a)(1) or after notification has been made  by the Commissioner under section 507(a)(2)(B), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph, the first day on  which action is taken by an organization which culminates in the  imposition of tax under section 507(c) shall be determined under the  rules set forth in Sec. 1.507-7(b) (1) and (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply if  the entire amount of the unpaid portion of the tax imposed by section  507(c) is abated by the Commissioner under section 507(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em>,  642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522, if such gift or bequest is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> in a taxable year for which it fails to meet the requirements  of section 508(e) (determined without regard to section 508(e)(2) (B)  and (C), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To any organization in a period for which it is not treated as  an organization described in section 501(c)(3) by reason of section  508(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph the  term taxable year refers to the taxable year of the donee or beneficiary  organization. In the event a bequest is made to a private foundation or  trust described in section 4947(a)(2) which is not in existence at the  date of the testator's death (but which is created under the terms of  the testator's will), the term taxable year shall mean the first taxable  year of the private foundation or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph, an  organization does not fail to meet the requirements of section 508(e)  for a taxable year, unless it fails to meet such requirements for the  entire year. Therefore, even if a donee organization fails to meet the  requirements of section 508(e) on the date it receives a grant from a  donor, the donor's grant will not be disallowed by operation of section  508(d)(2)(A) and subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph, if the  organization meets the requirements of section 508(e) (determined  without regard to section 508(e)(2) (B) or (C)) by the end of its  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No deduction will be disallowed under section 508(d)(2)(A) with  respect to a deduction under section 170, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c),  2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522 if during the taxable year in question, the  private foundation or trust described in section 4947(a)(2) has  instituted a judicial proceeding which is necessary to reform its  governing instrument or other instrument in order to meet the  requirements of section 508(e)(1). This subdivision shall not apply  unless within a reasonable time such judicial proceedings succeed in so  reforming such instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No deduction will be disallowed under section 508(d)(2)(A) and  subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph for any taxable year beginning  before January 1, 1972, with respect to a private foundation or trust  described in section 4947 organized before January 1, 1970. See also  Sec. 1.508-3(g) regarding transitional rules for extending compliance  with section 508(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)(a)</em> In the case of a contribution or bequest to a trust  described in section 4947(a)(2) other than to a trust to which  subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph applies, no deduction shall be  disallowed by reason of section 508(d)(2)(A) on the grounds that such  trust's governing instrument contains no provisions with respect to  section 4942. Similarly, if for a taxable year such trust is also a  trust described in section 4947(b)(3), no deduction for such year shall  be so disallowed on the grounds that the governing instrument contains  no provision with respect to section 4943 or 4944.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. H executes a will on January 1, 1977, establishing a  charitable remainder trust (as described in section 664) with income  payable to W, his wife, for life, remainder to X university, an  organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). The will provides  that the trust is prohibited from engaging in activities which would  subject itself, its foundation manager or a disqualified person to taxes  under section 4941 or 4945 of the Code. The will is silent as to  sections 4942, 4943, and 4944. H dies February 12, 1978. Section  508(d)(2)(A) will not operate to disallow any deduction to H's estate  under section 2055 with respect to such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)(a)</em> In the case of a trust described in section 4947(a)(2)  which by its terms will become a trust described in section 4947(a)(1)  and the governing instrument of which is executed after March 22, 1973,  the governing instrument shall not meet the requirements of section  508(e)(1) if it does not contain provisions to the effect that the trust  must comply with the provisions of section 4942, or sections 4942, 4943,  and 4944 (as the case may be) to the extent such section or sections  shall become applicable to such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example.

By its terms  the trust will become a trust described in section 4947(a)(1), and will  become a private foundation. The will provides that the trust is  prohibited from engaging in activities which would subject itself, its  foundation manager or a disqualified person to taxes under sections 4941  or 4945 of the Code. The will is silent as to sections 4942, 4943, and  4944. H dies February 12, 1978. Unless the trust's governing instrument  is amended prior to the end of the trust's first taxable year, or  judicial proceedings have been instituted under subdivision (iv) of this  subparagraph, section 508(d)(2)(A) will operate to disallow any  deduction to H's estate under section 2055 with respect to such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Since a charitable trust described in section 4947(a)(1) is  not required to file a notice under section 508(a), section 508(d)(2)(B)  and subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph are not applicable to such a  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(A)</em> if such deduction is attributable  to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property passing under the terms of a will executed on or before  October 9, 1969,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the decedent dies after October 9, 1969, but before October  9, 1972, without having amended any dispositive provision of the will  after October 9, 1969, by codicil or otherwise,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the decedent dies after October 9, 1969, and at no time after  that date had the right to change the portions of the will which  pertains to the passing of property to, or for the use of, an  organization described in section 170(c)(2)(B) or 2055(a), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)-2(b)(3)(ii))</em> to amend the  will by codicil or otherwise, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property transferred in trust on or before October 9, 1969,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the grantor dies after October 9, 1969, but before October 9,  1972, without having amended, after October 9, 1969, any dispositive  provision of the instrument governing the disposition of the property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the property transferred was an irrevocable interest to, or  for the use of, an organization described in section 170(c)(2)(B) or  2055(a),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)-2(b)(3)(ii))</em> to change  the disposition of the property, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the case of a deduction under section 642(c)(2)(A), if the  grantor is at all times after October 9, 1969, and up to, and including,  the last day of the taxable year for which the deduction under such  section is claimed, under a mental disability (as defined in  Sec. 1.642(c)-2(b)(3)(ii)) to change the terms of the trust   See also Sec. 1.508-3(g) regarding the extension of time for compliance  with   section 508(e), Sec. 1.664-1(f)(3) (ii) and (g) regarding the special  transitional rules for charitable remainder annuity and unitrusts  described in section 664 which were created prior to December 31, 1972,  and Sec. 20.2055-2(e)(4) of this chapter regarding the rules for  determining if the dispositive provisions have been amended.
