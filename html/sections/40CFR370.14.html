MSDS  reporting and inventory reporting are discussed in detail in subpart C  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To determine the quantity of an EHS or a non-EHS hazardous  chemical component present in a mixture, multiply the concentration of  the hazardous chemical component (in weight percent) by the weight of  the mixture (in pounds). You do not have to count a hazardous chemical  present in a mixture if the concentration is less than or equal to 1%,  or less than or equal to 0.1% for a carcinogenic chemical.</p>
