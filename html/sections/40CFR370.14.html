This means that if you report on a specific mixture as a whole for MSDS reporting, you must report on that mixture as a whole for inventory reporting too (unless it is not possible). MSDS reporting and inventory reporting are discussed in detail in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To determine the quantity of an EHS or a non-EHS hazardous chemical component present in a mixture, multiply the concentration of the hazardous chemical component (in weight percent) by the weight of the mixture (in pounds). You do not have to count a hazardous chemical present in a mixture if the concentration is less than or equal to 1%, or less than or equal to 0.1% for a carcinogenic chemical.</p>
