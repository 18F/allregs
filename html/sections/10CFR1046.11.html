                            <p class="depth0">Nothing in this part is intended to preclude emergency use of any available protective force personnel by an on-scene commander to successfully resolve a national security emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Essential functions. The essential functions described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and other site-specific essential functions must be communicated in writing by the manager of the Field Element to the PPMD and the Designated Physician. The Designated Physician is required to ensure applicant and incumbent PF members are aware that these essential physical and mental functions in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and other site-specific essential functions, as appropriate, and the medical certification standards provided in section 1046.13 if this part are the elements against which the initial and annual evaluations for PF personnel will be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SO essential functions. (1) The control of voluntary motor functions, strength, range of motion, neuromuscular coordination, stamina, and

dexterity needed to meet physical demands associated with routine and emergency situations of the job;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The control of voluntary motor functions, strength, range of motion, neuromuscular coordination, stamina, and

dexterity needed to meet physical demands associated with routine and emergency situations of the job;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ability to maintain the mental alertness necessary to perform all essential functions without posing a direct threat to self or others; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ability to understand and share essential, accurate communication by written, spoken, audible, visible, or other signals while using required protective equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional SO essential functions. SOs may be required to support SPOs and assist in the routine physical protection of DOE facilities, personnel, classified information, and property, as warranted by DOE facility operations, staff security posts used in controlling access to DOE facilities, conduct routine foot and vehicular patrols, escort visitors, check rooms and facilities, assess and report alarms, and perform basic first aid. Therefore, all SOs must also be able to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Understand and implement departmental and site policies and procedures governing post and patrol operations and access control systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Understand and implement departmental and site policies and procedures governing the SO's role in site protection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Understand and implement inspection techniques for persons, packages and vehicles, as well as detect and identify prohibited articles and site-specific security interests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Work in locations where assistance may not be available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spend extensive time outside exposed to the elements and working in wet, icy, hot, or muddy areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Make frequent transitions from hot to cold, cold to hot, dry to humid, and from humid to dry atmospheres;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Walk, climb stairs and ladders, and stand for prolonged periods of time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Safely operate motor vehicles when their use is required by local missions and duty assignments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Use clear and audible speech and radio communications in other than quiet environments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Read and understand policies, procedures, posted notices, and badges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Rely on the senses of smell, sight, hearing and touch to: detect the odor of products of combustion and of tracer and marker gases to detect prohibited articles; inspect persons, packages and vehicles; and in general determine the nature of emergencies; maintain personal safety; and report the nature of emergencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Employ weaponless self-defense; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Be fitted with and use respirators other than self-contained breathing apparatus when the use of such equipment is required by local assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FPRS SPO essential functions. FPRS SPO personnel may be assigned only to fixed posts where there is no planned requirement for response away from that post. In addition to the SO essential functions listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, FPRS SPOs must be able to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply basic tactics (to include use of intermediate force weapons) necessary to engage and neutralize armed adversaries and determine probable capabilities and motivations of potential adversaries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use site-specific hand tools and weapons required for the performance of duties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> While armed and authorized to use deadly force, perform complex tasks, make life or death and other critical decisions, and take appropriate actions under confusing, stressful conditions including potentially life-threatening environments throughout the duration of emergency situations, e.g., active shooter scenarios;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Perform physically demanding work under adverse weather and temperature conditions (extreme heat and extreme cold) on slippery or hazardous surfaces with the prolonged use of protective equipment and garments such as respirators, air supply hoods, or bullet-resistant garments, as required by site protection strategies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be fitted for and properly utilize personal duty equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Work for long periods of time in conditions requiring sustained physical activity and intense concentration in environments of high noise, poor visibility, limited mobility, at heights, and in enclosed or confined spaces;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Accommodate to changing work and meal schedules or to a delay in

meals without potential or actual incapacity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Have no known significant abnormal intolerance to chemical, mechanical (e.g., heat, light or water), and other physical agent exposures to the skin that may be encountered during routine and emergency duties, as specified at the site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> BRS SPO essential functions. In addition to the FPRS SPO essential functions listed above, BRS SPOs must be able to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Read placards and street signs while driving or to see and respond to imminently hazardous situations in both daylight and reduced light conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be capable of operating armored vehicles with an expectation of employing the capabilities of the vehicle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Staff security posts which normally require movement on foot, by vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft in response to alarms and any breach of security; and to support site protection strategies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide interdiction, interruption, neutralization, and support the recapture, pursuit and/or recovery of a DOE asset/site/facility/location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Make rapid transitions from rest to near maximal exertion without warm-up; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Otherwise act as needed to protect Department sites, personnel, classified information, and nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons components, and SNM, to apprehend suspects, and to participate in the armed defense of a Department site against a violent assault by adversaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> ARS SPO essential functions. The essential functions of an ARS SPO include those of a BRS SPO. Security posts which normally, or are expected to, require extensive tactical movement on foot must be staffed by ARS SPOs. In addition, an ARS SPO must be able to support the pursuit/recovery of a Department security interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> SRT member essential functions. The essential functions of an SRT member include those of an ARS SPO. The primary role of SRTs is the recapture, pursuit, and/or recovery of Department security interests. In addition, an SRT member must be trained to resolve incidents that require activities and force options that exceed the capabilities of other site PF members, as determined by site-specific analysis. An SRT SPO also must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Successfully complete a Departmental advanced tactical qualification course designed to provide the minimum level of skills and knowledge needed to completely perform all tasks associated with SRT job responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have knowledge and skills to provide additional protection capability as demanded by the particular targets, threats, and vulnerabilities existing at their assigned Departmental facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be able to operate special weapons, tactical vehicles, and other equipment necessary to protect a particular facility or to effectively engage an adversary with advanced capabilities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Possess the ability to act successfully as a member of an aggressive and readily mobile response team as dictated by site-specific vulnerability assessments, using force options and tactical response team techniques necessary for recapture and recovery operations directed against an adversary and to support site-specific protection strategies.</p>
