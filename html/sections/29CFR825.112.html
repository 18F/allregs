                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Circumstances qualifying for leave. Employers covered by FMLA  are required to grant leave to eligible employees:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn  child (see Sec. 825.120);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For placement with the employee of a son or daughter for  adoption or foster care (see Sec. 825.121);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent with  a serious health condition (see Sec. Sec. 825.113 and 825.122);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee  unable to perform the functions of the employee's job (see Sec. Sec.  825.113 and 825.123);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that  the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on  covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order  to covered active duty status (see Sec. Sec. 825.122 and 825.126); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or  illness if the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of  kin of the covered servicemember. See Sec. Sec. 825.122 and 825.127.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equal application. The right to take leave under FMLA applies  equally to male and female employees. A father, as well as a mother, can  take family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster care  of a child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Active employee. In situations where the employer/employee  relationship has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on  layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-employed before  being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such circumstances, an eligible  employee is immediately entitled to further FMLA leave for a qualifying  reason.</p>
