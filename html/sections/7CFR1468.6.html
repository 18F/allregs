                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After an easement has been recorded, no subordination, exchange, modification, or termination will be

made in any interest in land, or portion of such interest, except as approved by the NRCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NRCS may approve subordinations, exchanges, modifications, or terminations if NRCS determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is in the Federal Government's interest to subordinate, exchange, modify, or terminate the interest in the land enrolled in the program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The subordination, exchange, modification, or termination action will address a compelling public need or will facilitate the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program, as determined by the NRCS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is no practicable alternative that would address the compelling public need and avoid the easement area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> The change will not adversely affect the conservation functions and values for which the easement was acquired or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The change will not adversely affect the conservation functions and values for which the easement was acquired or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there are no practicable alternative that exists other than impact to the conservation value of the easement area, such adverse impacts have been minimized to the greatest extent practicable, and any remaining adverse impacts mitigated by enrollment of other lands that provide equal or greater conservation functions and values, as determined by NRCS, at no cost to the government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The easement subordination, modification, exchange, or termination under this section will not affect more than 10 percent of the original easement area. NRCS may authorize a greater percentage of the original easement area to be affected if NRCS determines that it is impracticable to achieve program purposes on the original easement area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The subordination, exchange, modification, or termination action will result in comparable conservation functions and value and equivalent or greater economic value to the United States as determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NRCS must determine that the landowner and, if applicable, the eligible entity agree to such easement subordination, modification, exchange, or termination prior to considering that such easement administration action should be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A determination of equal or greater economic value to the United States under paragraph (b) of this section will be made in accordance with an approved easement valuation methodology for ALE easements under subpart B or for WRE easements under subpart C. In addition to the value of the easement itself, NRCS may consider other financial investments it has made in the acquisition, restoration, and management of the original easement to ensure that the easement administration action results in equal or greater economic value to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subordinations, exchanges, modifications, or terminations must result in equal or greater conservation and economic values to the United States. Subordinations, exchanges, or modifications of ACEP easements must result in no net loss of easement acres.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When reviewing a proposed action under this section, the preferred alternative is to avoid the easement area. If the easement area cannot be avoided entirely, then the preferred alternative should minimize impacts to the original easement area and its conservation functions and values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Easement modifications, including subordinations, are preferred to easement exchanges which involve lands that are not physically adjacent to the original easement area. Easement exchanges are limited to circumstances where there are no available lands adjacent to the original easement area that will result in equal or greater conservation and economic values to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Replacement of easement acres as part of an easement exchange must occur within the same State and within the same eight-digit watershed as determined by the hydrologic unit codes developed by the U.S. Geological Survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Where NRCS determines that recordation of a new deed is necessary to effect an easement administration action under this section, NRCS will use the most recent version of the ACEP deed document or deed terms approved by NRCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If a modification, subordination or exchange involves an amended or new

easement deed, the amended or new easement deed will be duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of liens, and recordation of documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> At least 90 days prior to taking any termination action, written notice of such termination action will be provided to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A termination must meet criteria identified in this part and are limited to those circumstances where NRCS determines that the purposes of the program can no longer be achieved on the original easement area or the terms of the easement are no longer enforceable and there are no acceptable replacement acres available. NRCS will enter into a compensatory agreement with the proponent of the termination that identifies the costs for which the United States must be reimbursed, including but not limited to the value of the easement itself based upon current valuation methodologies, repayment of legal boundary survey costs, legal title work costs, associated easement purchase and restoration costs, and legal filing fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Easement plan. Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable law, NRCS may approve modifications to an easement plan that do not affect provisions of the easement. Easement plans include any agricultural land easement plans and component plans, wetland reserve plans of operations, or wetland reserve easement restoration agreements. Any easement plan modification must meet ACEP regulations and program objectives and must result in equal or greater conservation benefits on the enrolled land.</p>
