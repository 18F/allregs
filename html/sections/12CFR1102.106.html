                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial review. As in the case of requests for access, requests  by individuals for amendment to records pertaining to them will be  referred to the ASC's Privacy Act Officer for an initial determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards to be applied in reviewing requests. In reviewing  requests to amend records, the Privacy Act Officer will be guided by the  criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(e) (1) and (5), i.e., that records  maintained by the ASC shall contain only such information as is  necessary and relevant to accomplish a statutory purpose of the ASC as  required by statute or Executive Order of the President and that such  information also be accurate, timely, relevant and complete. These  criteria will be applied whether the request is to add material to a  record or to delete information from a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for acting on requests. Initial review of a request by an  individual to amend a record shall be completed as promptly as is  reasonably possible and normally within 30 days (excluding Saturdays,  Sundays, and Federal holidays) from the date the request was received,  unless unusual circumstances preclude completion of review within that  time. If the anticipated completion date indicated in the  acknowledgement cannot be met, the individual requesting the amendment  will be advised in writing of the delay and the reasons therefor, and  also advised when action is expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant of requests to amend records. If a request to amend a  record is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise the individual making the request in writing of the  extent to which it has been granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amend the record accordingly; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where an accounting of disclosures of the record has been kept  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), advise all previous recipients of the  record of the fact that the record has been amended and the substance of  the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of requests to amend records. If an individual's request  to amend a record pertaining to him is denied in whole or in part, the  Privacy Act Officer will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly advise the individual making the request in writing of  the extent to which the request has been denied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State the reasons for the denial of the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Describe the procedures established by the ASC to obtain further  review within the ASC of the request to amend, including the name and  address of the person to whom the appeal is to be addressed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inform the individual that the Privacy Act Officer will provide  information and assistance to the individual in perfecting an appeal of  the initial decision.</p>
