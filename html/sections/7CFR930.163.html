                                Sec. 930.163  Deferment of restricted obligation.

                            <p class="depth0">A handler may obtain a surety bond on restricted percentage cherries  to be posted to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserves must  be held. The surety bond must be posted at two times the market value of  the quantity of cherries for which the holding obligation is being  deferred. The Board can temporarily defer the date inventory reserve  cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. However,  this date shall not be later than 60 days prior to the end of the crop  year. The deferment shall be conditioned on the execution and delivery  by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within 30 days  after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under  Sec. 930.51. The written undertaking (required to be secured by a bond  or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board) must  guarantee that on or prior to the deferment date requested by the  handler the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage  obligation. On or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler,  the handler will have to fully satisfy the restricted percentage  obligation. In the event, a handler has posted the surety bond, reached  the deferment date deadline and does not have cherries in the inventory  reserve to cover his/her inventory reserve obligation, the bond will be  forfeited to the Board. The Board will then buy cherries to fulfill that  handler's obligation.  [66 FR 35891, July 10, 2001]</p><p class="depth0">Subpart_Assessment Rates</p>
