                            <p class="depth0">If the Agency decides to take an action in or affecting a floodplain  or wetland, it shall provide the public with a statement of its final  decision and shall explain the relevant factors considered by the Agency  in making this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition, those sent notices under Sec. 9.8 shall also be  provided the final notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For actions for which an environmental impact statement is being  prepared, the FEIS is adequate to constitute final notice in all cases  except where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Significant modifications are made in the FEIS after its initial  publication;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Significant modifications are made in the development plan for  the proposed action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Significant new information becomes available in the interim  between issuance of the FEIS and implementation of the proposed action.  If any of these situations develop, the Agency shall prepare a separate  final notice that contains the contents of paragraph (e) of this section  and shall make it available to those who received the FEIS. A minimum of  15 days shall, without good cause shown, be allowed for comment on the  final notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For actions for which an environmental assessment was prepared,  the Notice of No Significant Impact is adequate to constitute final  public notice, if it includes the information required under paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For all other actions, the finding shall be made in a document  separate from those described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this  section. Based on an assessment of the following factors, the  requirement for final notice may be met in a cumulative manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scale of the action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Potential for controversy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Degree of public need;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Number of affected agencies and individuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Its anticipated potential impact; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Similarity of the actions, i.e., to the extent that they are  susceptible of common descriptions and assessments.  When a damaged structure or facility is already being repaired by the  State or local government at the time of the Damage Survey Report, the  requirements of Steps 2 and 7 (Sec. Sec. 9.8 and 9.12) may be met by a  single notice. Such notice shall contain all the information required by  both sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The final notice shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of why the proposed action must be located in an  area affecting or affected by a floodplain or a wetland;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of all significant facts considered in making this  determination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of the alternatives considered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable  state and local floodplain protection standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement indicating how the action affects or is affected by  the floodplain and/or wetland, and how mitigation is to be achieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identification of the responsible official or organization for  implementation and monitoring of the proposed action, and from whom  further information can be obtained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A map of the area or a statement that such map is available for  public inspection, including the location at which such map may be  inspected and a telephone number to call for information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After providing the final notice, the Agency shall, without good  cause shown, wait at least 15 days before carrying out the action.
