As appropriate, a loss-sharing agreement may contain provisions  relating to definitions of terms, terms and conditions for activation,  determinations of assessment formulas, limitations on assessments,  reimbursements, administration, arbitration, and provisions for  amendment and termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> System institutions may agree among themselves to share losses  for the purpose of protecting against the impairment of capital stock or  participation certificates, or for any other purpose. Agreements may  provide for sharing losses that arise in the future or that were  recognized by one or more of the signatory institutions before the date  of the agreement. Agreements may contain provisions that are not  entirely reciprocal among the signatories to the agreement. Loss-sharing  agreements can provide for the sharing of loan losses, operating losses,  casualty losses, losses on high risk assets, or any other losses.
