                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for a loan, an applicant must demonstrate a  minimum equity position equal to 10 percent of the requested loan amount  at the time of application which must remain available at loan closing.  In addition to this minimum equity requirement, please refer to section  Sec. 1738.208, Additional Cash Requirements which could cause the equity  requirement to be higher than 10 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the applicant does not have the required equity at the time  the application is submitted, the applicant may satisfy the equity  requirement at the time of application with an investor's unconditional  legal commitment to cover the shortfall by providing additional equity.  The additional equity must be transferred to the applicant prior to loan  closing. If this option is elected, the applicant must provide evidence  in the application that clearly identifies the investor's commitment to  the applicant; the amount, terms, and conditions of the investment; and  the investor's bank or financial statements that demonstrate its ability  to fulfill its commitment. The terms and conditions of the investment  must be acceptable to the Agency, which generally prohibits redemption  of the investment until such time as stated requirements and financial  thresholds are achieved by the applicant. The Agency will reject  applications that do not provide evidence acceptable to the Agency  regarding the investor's commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For State and local government applicants, the equity  requirement can be satisfied with a general obligation bond, as long as  the additional equity will be available to the applicant at closing. If  the equity requirement is satisfied with a general obligation bond, the  broadband loan cannot be subordinate to the bond. The applicant must  submit an opinion from its legal counsel that the applicant has the  authority to issue a general obligation bond in an amount sufficient to  meet the minimum equity requirement. Revenue bonds supported by the  operations to be funded cannot be used to satisfy the equity  requirement.</p>
