Such duties and obligations include, without limitation, the duties set forth in Sec. 49.9 and the core principles set forth in Sec. 49.19; and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail.

its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities. Both types of testing should be conducted by qualified, independent professionals. Such qualified independent professionals may be independent contractors or employees of the swap data repository, but should not be persons responsible for development or operation of the systems or capabilities being tested. Pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.31, 49.12 and 45.2 of the Commission's Regulations, the swap data repository shall keep records of all such tests, and make all test results available to the Commission upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> To the extent practicable, a registered swap data repository should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coordinate its business continuity-disaster recovery plan with those of swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, swap dealers, and major swap participants who report swap data to the swap data repository, and with those regulators identified in Section 21(c)(7) of the Act, in a manner adequate to enable effective resumption of the registered swap data repository's fulfillment of its duties and obligations following a disruption causing activation of the swap data repository's business continuity and disaster recovery plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participate in periodic, synchronized testing of its business continuity--disaster recovery plan and the business continuity--disaster recovery plans of swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, swap dealers, and major swap participants who report swap data to the registered swap data repository, and the business continuity--disaster recovery plans required by the regulators identified in Section 21(c)(7) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that its business continuity--disaster recovery plan takes into account the business continuity--disaster recovery plans of its telecommunications, power, water, and other essential service providers.</p>
