The waiver request should be submitted directly to GSA and a copy forwarded to the DPMO. However, where GSA refuses to grant a waiver and it is believed that procurement through GSA would adversely affect or otherwise impair a program, the DPMO may, upon written request of the head of the DOE field organization, grant the authority for direct purchase of general purpose motor vehicles. Upon receipt of written authorization from the DPMO, the head of the field organization may authorize direct purchase of special purpose vehicles. The purchase price for passenger motor vehicles shall not exceed any statutory limitation in effect at the time the purchase is made.</p>
