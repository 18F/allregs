Each such voter shall be entitled to cast one  ballot and each ballot shall have exactly the same value as the voter's  headright interest shown on the last quarterly annuity roll. Any  fraction of a headright, however, shall be valued as to the first two  decimals only unless such interest is less than one-hundredth of a  share, then it shall have its full value.
