                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Representation of SDVO SBC status. An SDVO SBC must submit the following representations with its initial offer (which includes price) on a specific contract:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is an SDVO SBC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is small under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It will meet the percentage of work requirements set forth in Sec. 125.6;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If applicable, it is an eligible joint venture; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If applicable, it is an eligible nonmanufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Joint ventures. An SDVO SBC may enter into a joint venture agreement with one or more other SBCs for the purpose of performing an SDVO contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Size of concerns to an SDVO SBC joint venture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A joint venture of at least one SDVO SBC and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVO SBC procurement so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For a procurement having a revenue-based size standard, the procurement exceeds half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the procurement exceeds $10 million;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For sole source and competitive SDVO SBC procurements that do not exceed the dollar levels identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, an SDVO SBC entering into a joint venture agreement with another concern is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with the other concern with respect to performance of the SDVO contract. The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture must meet the size standard for the NAICS code assigned to the SDVO contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of joint venture agreement. Every joint venture agreement to perform an SDVO contract must contain a provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Designating an SDVO SBC as the managing venturer of the joint venture, and an employee of the managing venturer as the project manager responsible for performance of the SDVO contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stating that not less than 51% of the net profits earned by the joint venture will be distributed to the SDVO SBC(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to contract performance, source of labor and negotiation of the SDVO contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure performance of the SDVO contract and to complete performance despite the withdrawal of any member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Requiring the final original records be retained by the managing venturer upon completion of the SDVO contract performed by the joint venture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Performance of work. For any SDVO contract, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by Sec. 124.510 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute an SDVO contract in the name of the joint venture entity or SDVO SBC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Inspection of records. SBA may inspect the records of the joint venture without notice at any time deemed necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Non-manufacturers. An SDVO SBC which is a non-manufacturer may submit an offer on an SDVO contract for supplies if it meets the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule set forth at Sec. 121.406(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiple Award Contracts. (1) Total Set-Aside Contracts. The SDVO SBC must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 121.406(b)), if applicable, in the performance of a contract totally set-aside for SDVO SBCs. However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the concern to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partial Set-Aside Contracts. For orders awarded under a partial set-aside contract, the SDVO SBC must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 121.406(b)), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract--e.g., during the base term and then during each option period thereafter. For orders awarded under the non-set-aside portion, the SDVO SBC need not comply with any limitations on subcontracting or nonmanufacturer rule

requirements. However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the concern to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Orders. The SDVO SBC must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 121.406(b)), if applicable, in the performance of each individual order that has been set-aside for SDVO SBCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reserves. The SDVO SBC must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see Sec. 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see Sec. 121.406(b)), if applicable, in the performance of an order that is set aside for SDVO SBCs. However, the SDVO SBC will not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting provisions and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed amongst SDVO SBCs and one or more other-than-small business concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Recertification. (1) A concern that represents itself and qualifies as an SDVO SBC at the time of initial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation), which includes price, including a Multiple Award Contract, is considered an SDVO SBC throughout the life of that contract. This means that if an SDVO SBC is qualified at the time of initial offer for a Multiple Award Contract, then it will be considered an SDVO SBC for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests a new SDVO SBC certification in connection with a specific order. Where a concern later fails to qualify as an SDVO SBC, the procuring agency may exercise options and still count the award as an award to an SDVO SBC. However, the following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where an SDVO contract is novated to another business concern, the concern that will continue performance on the contract must certify its status as an SDVO SBC to the procuring agency, or inform the procuring agency that it does not qualify as an SDVO SBC, within 30 days of the novation approval. If the concern is not an SDVO SBC, the agency can no longer count the options or orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its SDVO goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where a concern that is performing an SDVO SBC contract acquires, is acquired by, or merges with another concern and contract novation is not required, the concern must, within 30 days of the transaction becoming final, recertify its SDVO SBC status to the procuring agency, or inform the procuring agency that it no longer qualifies as an SDVO SBC. If the contractor is not an SDVO SBC, the agency can no longer count the options or orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its SDVO goals. The agency and the contractor must immediately revise all applicable Federal contract databases to reflect the new status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where there has been an SDVO SBC status protest on the solicitation or contract, see Sec. 125.27(e) for the effect of the status determination on the contract award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of contracts (including Multiple Award Contracts) with durations of more than five years (including options), a contracting officer must request that a business concern recertify its SDVO SBC status no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract, and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A business concern that did not certify itself as an SDVO SBC, either initially or prior to an option being exercised, may recertify itself as an SDVO SBC for a subsequent option period if it meets the eligibility requirements at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recertification does not change the terms and conditions of the contract. The limitations on subcontracting, nonmanufacturer and subcontracting plan requirements in effect at the time of contract award remain in effect throughout the life of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the contracting officer explicitly requires concerns to recertify their status in response to a solicitation for an order, SBA will determine eligibility as of the date the concern submits its self-representation as part

of its response to the solicitation for the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A concern's status may be determined at the time of a response to a solicitation for an Agreement and each order issued pursuant to the Agreement.
