                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial payment. At closing an initial payment shall be made by the mortgagee in an amount equal to the

sum of initial MIP under Sec. 206.105(a) if not paid in cash by the mortgagor, fees and charges allowed under Sec. 206.31(a) if not paid in cash by the mortgagor, and any additional payment requested by the mortgagor. The total initial payment, plus any amount set aside for repairs after closing under Sec. 206.47, for property charges under Sec. 206.205(f), or for servicing charges under Sec. 206.207(b), shall not exceed the principal limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monthly payments--term option. (1) Using factors provided by the Secretary, the mortgagee shall calculate the monthly payment so that the sum of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section added to paragraphs (b)(1)(iii), (b)(1)(iv), (b)(1)(v) and (b)(1)(vi) of this section shall be equal to the principal limit at the end of the payment term:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Using factors provided by the Secretary, the mortgagee shall calculate the monthly payment so that the sum of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section added to paragraphs (b)(1)(iii), (b)(1)(iv), (b)(1)(v) and (b)(1)(vi) of this section shall be equal to the principal limit at the end of the payment term:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An initial payment under paragraph (a) of this section plus any initial servicing charge set aside under Sec. 206.19(d); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mortgage balance at the time of a change in payments option in accordance with Sec. 206.26, plus any remaining servicing charge set aside under Sec. 206.19(d); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The portion of the principal limit set aside as a line of credit including any set asides for repairs and first year property charges under Sec. 206.19(d); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All monthly payments due through the payment term, including funds withheld for payment of property charges under Sec. 206.205; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All MIP, or monthly charges due to the Secretary in lieu of mortgage insurance premiums due through the payment term; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All interest through the remainder of the payment term. The expected average mortgage interest rate shall be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the mortgage has an adjustable interest rate, the mortgagee shall make all monthly payments through the payment term even if the mortgage balance exceeds the principal limit because the actual average mortgage interest rate exceeds the expected average mortgage interest rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monthly payments--tenure option. Monthly payments under the tenure payment option shall be calculated as if the number of months in the payment term equals 100 minus the age of the youngest mortgagor multiplied by 12, but payments shall continue until the mortgage becomes due and payable under Sec. 206.27(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Line of credit separately or with monthly payments. If the mortgagor has a line of credit, separately or combined with the term or tenure payment option, the principal limit is divided into an amount set aside for servicing charges under Sec. 206.19(d), an amount equal to the line of credit (including any portion of the principal limit set aside for repairs or property charges under Sec. 206.19(d)), and the remaining amount of the principal limit (if any). The line of credit amount increases at the same rate as the total principal limit increases under Sec. 206.3. A payment under the line of credit may not exceed the difference between the current amount of the principal limit for the line of credit and the portion of the mortgage balance, including accrued interest and MIP, attributable to draws on the line of credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment of MIP and interest. At the end of each month, interest accrued during the month shall be added to the mortgage balance. Monthly MIP shall be added to the mortgage balance when paid to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Mortgagee late charge. The mortgagee shall pay a late charge to the mortgagor for any late payment. If the mortgagee does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly payment to the mortgagor on the first business day of the month or make a line of credit payment within 5 business days of the date the mortgagee received the request, the late charge shall be 10 percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the mortgagor for that month or as a result of that request. For each additional day that the mortgagor does not receive payment, the mortgagee shall pay interest at the mortgage interest rate on the late payment. In no event shall the total late charge exceed five hundred dollars. Any late charge shall be paid from the mortgagee's funds and shall not be added to the mortgage balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No minimum payments. A mortgagee shall not require, as a condition

of providing a loan secured by a mortgage insured under this part, that the monthly payments under the term or tenure payment option or draws under the line of credit payment option exceed a minimum amount established by the mortgagee.
