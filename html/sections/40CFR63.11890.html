                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The emission limits, operating limits and work practice  standards specified in this subpart apply at all times, including  periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At all times, you must operate and maintain your affected  source, including associated air pollution control components and  monitoring system components, in a manner consistent with safety and  good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.  Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures  are being used will be based on information available to the  Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring  results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of  operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs  associated with monitoring system malfunctions and required monitoring  system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as  applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments),  you must operate the continuous monitoring system   at all times the affected source is operating. A monitoring system  malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable  failure of the monitoring system to provide data. Monitoring system  failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless  operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring  system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to  return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as  practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may not use data recorded during monitoring system  malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or  required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in  calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use  all the data collected during all other required data collection periods  in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control  system. You must report any periods for which the monitoring system  failed to collect required data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em>  through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any instance in which an affected source subject to this  subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source, fails to meet any  requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including, but  not limited to, any emission limit, operating limit or work practice  standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a performance test indicates that emissions of a pollutant  in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart are exceeding the emission standard for  the pollutant specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, exceeds an emission  limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the average value of a monitored operating parameter, based  on the data averaging period for compliance specified in Table 5 to this  subpart, does not meet the operating limit established in  Sec. 63.11880(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em> through (iv)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pressure relief device, as defined in Sec. 63.12005.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A bypass, as defined in Sec. 63.12005.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A closed vent system in vacuum service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A closure device on a pressure vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> or (ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable  requirement in this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any term or condition relating to compliance with this subpart  that is included in the operating permit for any affected source  required to obtain such a permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any failure to collect required data, except for periods of  monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring  system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or  quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks  and required zero and span adjustments).</p>
