The recipient in France of any dividend, paid on or after January 1,  1957, from which United States tax at the reduced rate of 15 percent has  been withheld at source pursuant to Sec. 514.2(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, who is a nominee  or representative through whom the dividend is received by a person  other than one described in Sec. 514.2(a) as being entitled to the  reduced rate, shall withhold an additional amount of United States tax  equivalent to the United States tax which would have been withheld if  the convention had not been in effect (30 percent as of the date of  approval of Sec. Sec. 514.1 to 514.10) minus the 15 percent which has  been withheld at the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiduciary or partnership. A fiduciary or a partnership with an  address in France which receives, otherwise than as a nominee or  representative, a dividend from which United States tax at the reduced  rate of 15 percent has been withheld at source pursuant to Sec. 514.2  shall withhold an additional amount of United States tax from the  portion of the dividend included in the gross income from sources within  the United States of any beneficiary or partner, as the case may be, who  is not entitled to the reduced rate of tax in accordance with Sec.  514.2(c). The amount of the additional tax is to be calculated in the  same manner as under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Released amounts of tax. If any amount of United States tax is  released pursuant to Sec. 514.8(a)(1) by the withholding agent in the  United States with respect to a dividend paid to a nominee,  representative, fiduciary, or partnership with an address in France, the  latter shall withhold from such released amount any additional amount of  United States tax, otherwise required to be withheld from the dividend  by the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, in the  same manner as if at the time of payment of the dividends United States  tax at the   rate of only 15 percent had been withheld at source therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Returns filed by French withholding agents. The amounts withheld  pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by any withholding agent in  France shall be deposited, without converting the amounts into United  States dollars, with the Directeur General des Impots of France on or  before the 15th day after the close of the quarter of the calendar year  in which the withholding in France occurs. The withholding agent making  the deposit shall render therewith such appropriate French form as may  be prescribed by the Directeur General des Impots.

C., U.  S. A., on or before the end of the calendar month in which the deposit  is made, and should be accompanied by such French form as may be  required to be rendered by the withholding agent in France in connection  with the deposit.</p>
