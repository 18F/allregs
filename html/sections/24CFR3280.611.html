Listed transition fittings shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Size of vent piping--(1) Main vent. The drain piping for each toilet shall be vented by a 1\1/2\ inch minimum diameter vent or rectangular vent of venting cross section equivalent to or greater than the venting cross section of a 1\1/2\ inch diameter vent, connected to the toilet drain by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Main vent. The drain piping for each toilet shall be vented by a 1\1/2\ inch minimum diameter vent or rectangular vent of venting cross section equivalent to or greater than the venting cross section of a 1\1/2\ inch diameter vent, connected to the toilet drain by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A 1\1/2\ inch diameter (min.) individual vent pipe or equivalent directly connected to the toilet drain within the distance allowed in Sec. 3280.611(c)(5), for 3-inch trap arms undiminished in size through the roof,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A 1\1/2\ inch diameter (min.) continuous vent or equivalent, indirectly connected to the toilet drain piping within the distance allowed in Sec. 3280.611(c)(5) for 3 inch trap arms through a 2-inch wet vented drain that carries the waste of not more than one fixture, or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Two or more vented drains when at least one is wet-vented, or 2-inch diameter (minimum), and each drain is separately connected to the toilet drain. At least one of the drains shall connect within the distance allowed in Sec. 3280.611(c)(5) for 3-inch trap arms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vent pipe areas. Each individually vented fixture with a 1\1/2\ inch or smaller trap shall be provided with a vent pipe equivalent in area to a 1\1/4\ inch nominal pipe size. The main vent, toilet vent and relief vent, and the continuous vent of wet-vented systems shall have an area equivalent to 1\1/2\ inch nominal pipe size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Common vent. When two fixture traps located within the distance allowed from their vent have their trap arms connected separately at the same level into an approved double fitting, an individual vent pipe may serve as a common vent without any increase in size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Intersecting vents. Where two or more vent pipes are joined together, no increase in size shall be required; however, the largest vent pipe shall extend full size through the roof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distance of fixture trap from vent shall not exceed the values given in the following table:</p><p class="depth0">Maximum Distance of Fixtures From Vent Trap------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Size of fixture drain (inches)            Distance trap to vent------------------------------------------------------------------------1\1/4\....................................  4 ft. 6 in.1\1/2\....................................  4 ft 6 in.2.........................................  5 ft.3.........................................  6 ft.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mechanical Vents. Where mechanical vents are used as a secondary vent system for plumbing fixtures that are

protected by traps, the mechanical vents must comply with paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Spring-operated mechanical (anti-siphon) vents must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No more than two fixtures individually protected by the spring-operated mechanical vent may be drained by a common 1\1/2\ inch diameter drain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The drain size for three or more fixtures individually protected by a spring-operated mechanical vent must be at least 2 inches in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Spring-operated mechanical vents are restricted to venting fixtures with 1\1/2\ inch traps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A spring-operated mechanical vent must be installed in a location that allows a free flow of air and is accessible for inspection, maintenance, and replacement.
