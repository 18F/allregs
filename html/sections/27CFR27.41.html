The effective tax rate may be rounded  to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided  that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to  the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products  will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In  such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is  five or over, a unit will be added.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following is an example of the use of the formula. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible  flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 -  (2\1/2\%) x 3.371.8 = 16.6).</p><p class="depth2">Batch Record Distilled spirits..............................    2249.1 proof gallons.
