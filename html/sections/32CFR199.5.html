It does not provide acute care nor benefits available through the TRICARE Basic Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of the ECHO is to provide an additional financial resource for an integrated set of services and supplies designed to assist in the reduction of the disabling effects of the ECHO-eligible dependent's qualifying condition. Services include those necessary to maintain, minimize or prevent deterioration of function of an ECHO-eligible dependent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. (1) The following categories of TRICARE/CHAMPUS beneficiaries with a qualifying condition are ECHO-eligible dependents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following categories of TRICARE/CHAMPUS beneficiaries with a qualifying condition are ECHO-eligible dependents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)) of a member of the Uniformed Services on active duty for a period of more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An abused dependent as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)), of a member of the Uniformed Services who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and whose death occurs on or after October 7, 2001. In such case, an eligible surviving spouse remains eligible for benefits under the ECHO for a period of 3 years from the date the active duty sponsor dies. Any other eligible surviving dependent remains eligible for benefits under the ECHO for a period of three years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Attains 21 years of age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as defined in paragraphs Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)) of a deceased member of the Uniformed Services who, at the time of the member's death was receiving benefits under ECHO, and the member at the time of death was eligible for receipt of hostile-fire pay, or died as a result of a disease or injury incurred while eligible for such pay. In such a case, the surviving dependent remains eligible for benefits under ECHO through midnight of the dependent's twenty-first birthday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualifying condition. The following are qualifying conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mental retardation.

Beneficiaries under the age of 3 years who are diagnosed with a neuromuscular developmental condition or other condition that is expected to precede a diagnosis of moderate or severe mental retardation or a serious physical disability, shall be deemed to have a qualifying condition for the ECHO. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee shall establish criteria for ECHO eligibility in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Multiple disabilities. The cumulative effect of multiple disabilities, as determined by the Director, TRICARE

Management Activity or designee shall be used in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section to determine a qualifying condition when the beneficiary has two or more disabilities involving separate body systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Loss of ECHO eligibility.

Benefits shall be provided in the beneficiary's home or another environment, as appropriate. An AT device may be covered only if it is recommended in a beneficiary's Individual Educational Program (IEP) or, if the beneficiary is not eligible for an IEP, the AT device is an item or educational learning device normally included in an IEP and is preauthorized under ECHO as an integral component of the beneficiary's individual comprehensive health care services plan (including rehabilitation) as prescribed by a TRICARE authorized provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An AT device may be covered under ECHO only if it is not otherwise covered by TRICARE as durable equipment, a prosthetic, augmentation communication device, or other benefits under Sec. 199.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An AT device may include an educational learning device directly related to the beneficiary's qualifying condition when recommended by an IEP and not otherwise provided by State or local government programs.

Duplicative or redundant platforms are not allowed; however, a second platform may be obtained, if the individual's IEP recommends one platform such as a computer for the majority of the learning objectives, but there exists another objective, which cannot be performed on that platform. In these limited circumstances, the beneficiary may submit a request with the above justification to the Director, TMA, who may authorize a second device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> AT devices damaged through improper use of the device as well as lost or stolen devices may not be replaced until the device would next be eligible for a lifecycle replacement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> AT devices do not include equipment or devices whose primary purpose

is to assist the individual to engage in sports or recreational activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Training that teaches the use of assistive technology devices or to acquire skills that are necessary for the management of the qualifying condition.

ECHO beneficiaries are eligible for 16 hours of respite care per month in any month during which the beneficiary otherwise receives an ECHO benefit(s). Respite care is defined in Sec. 199.2. Respite care services will be provided by a TRICARE-authorized home health agency and will be designed to provide health care services for the covered beneficiary, and not baby-sitting or child-care services for other members of the family. The benefit will not be cumulative, that is, any respite care hours not used in one month will not be carried over or banked for use on another occasion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> TRICARE-authorized home health agencies must provide and bill for all authorized ECHO respite care services through established TRICARE claims' mechanisms.

Domiciliary care, as defined in Sec. 199.2, is excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Respite care. Respite care for the purpose of covering primary caregiver (as defined in Sec. 199.2) absences due to deployment, employment, seeking of employment or to pursue education is

excluded. Authorized respite care covers only the ECHO beneficiary, not siblings or others who may reside in or be visiting in the beneficiary's residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> ECHO Home Health Care (EHHC). The EHHC benefit provides coverage of home health care services and respite care services specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Home health care. Covered ECHO home health care services are the same as, and provided under the same conditions as those services described in Sec. 199.4(e)(21)(i), except that they are not limited to part-time or intermittent services. Custodial care services, as defined in Sec. 199.2, may be provided to the extent such services are provided in conjunction with authorized ECHO home health care services, including the EHHC respite care benefit specified in this section. Beneficiaries who are authorized EHHC will receive all home health care services under EHHC and no portion will be provided under the Basic Program. TRICARE-authorized home health agencies are not required to use the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) to assess beneficiaries who are authorized EHHC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Respite care. EHHC beneficiaries whose plan of care includes frequent interventions by the primary caregiver(s) are eligible for respite care services in lieu of the ECHO general respite care benefit. For the purpose of this section, the term ``frequent'' means ``more than two interventions during the eight-hour period per day that the primary caregiver would normally be sleeping.'' The services performed by the primary caregiver are those that can be performed safely and effectively by the average non-medical person without direct supervision of a health care provider after the primary caregiver has been trained by appropriate medical personnel. EHHC beneficiaries in this situation are eligible for a maximum of eight hours per day, 5 days per week, of respite care by a TRICARE-authorized home health agency. The home health agency will provide the health care interventions or services for the covered beneficiary so that the primary caregiver is relieved of the responsibility to provide such interventions or services for the duration of that period of respite care. The home health agency will not provide baby-sitting or child care services for other members of the family. The benefit is not cumulative, that is, any respite care hours not used in a given day may not be carried over or banked for use on another occasion. Additionally, the eight-hour respite care periods will not be provided consecutively, that is, a respite care period on one calendar day will not be immediately followed by a respite care period the next calendar day. The Government's cost-share incurred for these services accrue to the maximum yearly ECHO Home Health Care benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EHHC eligibility. The EHHC is authorized for beneficiaries who meet all applicable ECHO eligibility requirements and who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Physically reside within the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are homebound, as defined in Sec. 199.2; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Require medically necessary skilled services that exceed the level of coverage provided under the Basic Program's home health care benefit; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Require frequent interventions by the primary caregiver(s) such that respite care services are necessary to allow primary caregiver(s) the opportunity to rest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Are case managed to include a reassessment at least every 90 days, and receive services as outlined in a written plan of care; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Receive all home health care services from a TRICARE-authorized home health agency, as described in Sec. 199.6(b)(4)(xv), in the beneficiary's primary residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> EHHC plan of care. A written plan of care is required prior to authorizing ECHO home health care. The plan must include the type, frequency, scope and duration of the care to be provided and support the professional level of provider. Reimbursement will not be authorized for a level of provider not identified in the plan of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> EHHC exclusions--(i) General. ECHO Home Health Care services and supplies are excluded from those who are being provided continuing coverage of home health care as participants of

the former Individual Case Management Program for Persons with Extraordinary Conditions (ICMP-PEC) or previous case management demonstrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General.
