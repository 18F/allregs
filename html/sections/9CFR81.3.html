                            <p class="depth0">No farmed or captive deer, elk, or moose may be moved interstate  unless it meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Animals in the CWD Herd Certification Program. The captive deer,  elk, or moose is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enrolled in the CWD Herd Certification Program and the herd has  achieved Certified status in accordance with Sec. 55.24 of this  chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is accompanied by a certificate issued in accordance with Sec.  81.4 that identifies its herd of origin and that states that the  animal's herd has achieved Certified status and that the animal does not  show clinical signs associated with CWD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Animals captured for interstate movement and release. If the  captive deer, elk, or moose was captured from a wild population for  interstate movement and release, each animal must have two forms of  animal identification, one of which is official animal identification,  and the certificate issued in accordance with Sec. 81.4 that  accompanies the animal must state that the source population has been  documented to be low risk for CWD, based on a CWD surveillance program  in wild cervid populations that is approved by the State Government of  the receiving State and by APHIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Animals moved to slaughter. The farmed or captive deer, elk, or  moose must be moved directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment  for slaughter, must have two forms of animal identification, one of  which is official animal identification, and must be accompanied by a  certificate issued in accordance with Sec. 81.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Research animal movements and permits. A research animal permit  is required for the interstate movement of cervids for research  purposes. The permit will specify any special conditions   of the movement determined by the Administrator to be necessary to  prevent the dissemination of CWD. The Administrator may, at his or her  discretion, issue the permit if he or she determines that the  destination facility has adequate biosecurity and that the movement  authorized will not result in the interstate dissemination of CWD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To apply for a research animal permit, contact an APHIS employee  or State representative and provide the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of the person to whom the special permit is  issued, the address at which the research cervids to be moved interstate  are being held, and the name and address of the person receiving the  cervids to be moved interstate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number and type of cervids to be moved interstate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reason for the interstate movement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any safeguards in place to prevent transmission of CWD during  movement or at the receiving location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The date on which movement will occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the research animal permit must accompany the cervids  moved, and copies must be submitted so that a copy is received by the  State animal health official and the veterinarian in charge for the  State of destination at least 72 hours prior to the arrival of the  cervids at the destination listed on the research animal permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interstate movements approved by the Administrator.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, interstate movement of  farmed or captive deer, elk, and moose may be allowed on a case-by-case  basis when the Administrator determines that adequate survey and  mitigation procedures are in place to prevent dissemination of CWD and  issues a permit for the movement.</p>
