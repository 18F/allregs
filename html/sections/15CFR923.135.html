                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures and criteria for invoking and lifting interim  sanctions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As required by section 312(c) of the Act:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary may suspend payment of any portion of financial  assistance extended to any coastal State, and may withdraw any  unexpended portion of such assistance, if the Secretary determines that  the coastal State is failing to adhere to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The management program or a State plan developed to manage a  national estuarine reserve established under section 315 of the Act (16  U.S.C. 1461), or a portion of the program or plan approved by the  Secretary; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The terms of any grant or cooperative agreement funded under  this title (16 U.S.C. 1451-1464).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Financial assistance may not be suspended under paragraph  (a)(1)(i) of this section unless the Secretary provides the Governor of  the coastal State with--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Written specifications and a schedule for the actions that  should be taken by the State in order that such suspension of financial  assistance may be withdrawn; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Written specifications stating how those funds from the  suspended financial assistance shall be expended by the coastal State to  take the actions referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The suspension of financial assistance may not last for less  than 6 months or more than 36 months after the date of suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Assistant Administrator will identify the  need for interim sanctions through the continuing review process. The  Assistant Administrator will use the criteria at Sec. 923.135(a)(3) in  determining when to invoke interim sanctions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Assistant Administrator will issue the State a preliminary  finding of non-adherence with the approved CZM program, or a portion  thereof, and/or with a term or terms of a grant or cooperative  agreement. This preliminary finding of non-adherence may be contained in  the draft evaluation findings, or in a preliminary notification letter  to the State CZM program manager. If the preliminary finding is  contained in a preliminary notification letter, the Assistant  Administrator will comply with the applicable public participation  requirements of section 312(b) and NOAA's regulations at Sec. 923.134.  The draft evaluation findings or preliminary notification letter  containing a preliminary finding of non-adherence will explain that if  the finding of non-adherence is issued, the State is subject to  suspension of financial assistance and, if the State fails to take the  actions specified pursuant to section 312(c) and this part, to  withdrawal of program approval and financial assistance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State will be given 30 days from receipt of the draft  evaluation findings or preliminary notification letter to comment on and  rebut the preliminary finding of non-adherence. During this 30-day  period, the State may request up to 15 additional days to respond, for a  maximum of 45 days from receipt of the draft evaluation findings or  preliminary notification letter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> After considering the State's comments, the Assistant  Administrator will decide whether or not to issue a final finding of  non-adherence. If the Assistant Administrator decides to issue a final  finding of non-adherence, he/she will do so in the final evaluation  findings issued pursuant to section 312(b) or in a final notification  letter as provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The  Assistant Administrator may invoke interim sanctions provided by section  312(c) immediately or at any time after issuing the final evaluation  findings or final notification letter containing the finding of non- adherence, but not later than the next regularly scheduled evaluation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the Assistant Administrator decides to invoke interim  sanctions, he/she will do so by sending the final evaluation findings or  final notification letter to the Governor of the State and the State CZM  program manager. The final evaluation findings or final notification  letter will contain the information required in section 312(c)(2) (A)  and (B). This information will include the amount of financial  assistance to be suspended and redirected, the actions the State should  take in order to have the suspension withdrawn, how the suspended funds  shall be expended to take the required actions, and a schedule for  taking the required actions. The final evaluation findings or final  notification letter will also contain the length of the suspension,  which may not last for less than 6 months or more than 36 months. The  Assistant Administrator will establish the length of the suspension  based on the amount of time that is reasonably necessary for the State  to take the required actions. If the State can take the required actions  faster than expected, the suspension can be withdrawn early (but not in  less than six months).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The State must respond to the final evaluation findings or  final notification letter by developing a proposed work program to  accomplish the required actions on the schedule set forth in the final  evaluation findings or final notification letter. The State may propose  an alternative approach to accomplishing the required actions and/or an  alternative schedule. The Assistant Administrator's approval of the  State's work program will signify his/her agreement with the approach  and schedule for accomplishing the actions necessary to withdraw the  suspension.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The Assistant Administrator will monitor State performance  under the work program. This may involve additional direction to the  State through the grant administration process and/or a visit to the  State by appropriate NOAA program staff, evaluation staff and/or other  experts to work with the State on a specific problem or issue. The  Assistant Administrator will consider proposals to revise the work  program on a case-by-case basis, providing that the State will still be  able to accomplish the necessary actions within a maximum of 36 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The State must document that it has taken the required  actions on the schedule established under this section. The State must  provide its documentation in writing to the Assistant Administrator. The  Assistant Administrator may conduct a follow-up evaluation or otherwise  revisit the State at his/her discretion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> If the Assistant Administrator determines that the required  actions have been taken, the Assistant Administrator will promptly  notify the Governor and the State program manager, in writing, that NOAA  has withdrawn the suspension of financial assistance. If, however, the  State does not take the required actions, then the Assistant  Administrator will invoke the final sanction provisions of section  312(d) on program termination and withdrawal of all financial  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Criteria for invoking interim sanctions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Assistant  Administrator may consider the following indicators of non-adherence to  an approved State CZM program in determining whether to invoke interim  sanctions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ineffective or inconsistent implementation of legally  enforceable policies included in the CZM program. Indicators of  ineffective or inconsistent implementation could include: evidence of  non-compliance with core authorities by the regulated community;  insufficient monitoring and inspecting of coastal development to ensure  that it conforms to program requirements and applicable conditions; or  inadequate   enforcement action when development is found not to be in compliance  with the program or permit under which it is authorized or is found to  be an unpermitted activity. In applying this indicator, NOAA will  consider any available evidence of the impacts of ineffective or  inconsistent implementation on coastal resources.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Inadequate monitoring of the actions of State and local agencies  for compliance with the program. Indicators of inadequate monitoring of  these agencies could include: evidence of non-compliance of networked  agencies with the CZM program, unresolved conflicts between agencies  regarding what constitutes compliance with the program, or lack of a  mechanism to ensure that all State agencies will adhere to the program  or to approved local coastal programs pursuant to NOAA's regulations at  15 CFR 923.40 (and pursuant to new section 306(d)(15), after November 5,  1993 and after states have been given reasonable opportunity to comply  with NOAA's implementing guidance).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Non-compliance of local coastal programs with the approved State  program. Indicators of non-compliance could include: Local permitting or  zoning decisions that are inconsistent with State standards or criteria,  widespread granting of variances such as to render a zoning program  ineffective in meeting State standards or criteria, changes to local  comprehensive plans or zoning maps that are inconsistent with State  standards or criteria, or inadequate monitoring and enforcement, as  described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Ineffective implementation of Federal consistency authority.  Indicators of ineffective implementation could include: Not reviewing  Federal activities, Federal licenses and permits, including offshore oil  and gas exploration and development, and Federal financial assistance to  State and local governments for consistency with the approved CZM  program or employing review procedures that are not in accordance with  State and NOAA regulations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Inadequate opportunity for intergovernmental cooperation and  public participation in management program implementation. Indicators of  inadequate opportunity could include: not carrying out procedures  necessary to insure adequate consideration of the national interest in  facilities which are necessary to meet requirements which are other than  local in nature, not implementing effectively mechanisms for continuing  consultation and coordination, not providing required notice that a  management program decision would conflict with a local zoning  ordinance, decision or other action pursuant to section 306(d)(3)(B)(i)  and 15 CFR 923.57, or not providing opportunities for public  participation in permitting processes, consistency determinations and  other similar decisions pursuant to new section 306(d)(14) after  November 5, 1993 and after states have been given reasonable opportunity  to comply with NOAA's implementing guidance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Non-adherence to the terms of a grant or cooperative agreement,  including the schedule for funded activities. The Assistant  Administrator will also consider the extent to which priorities for  expenditure of Federal funds reflect an appropriate priority for  activities necessary to implement and enforce core program authorities  effectively.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Not submitting changes to the approved program for Federal  approval on a schedule developed pursuant to 15 CFR 923.81(a) and  923.84(b)(1)(i) or developing and implementing changes to the approved  program without Federal approval which are inconsistent with the Act or  the approved program or which result in a reduced level of protection of  coastal resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Assistant Administrator may consider whether an indication  of non-adherence is of recent origin (in which case the State may be  given a reasonable opportunity to correct it) or has been repeatedly  brought to the State's attention without corrective action in  determining whether to invoke interim sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal of program approval and financial assistance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As  required by sections 312(d) and 312(e) of the Act:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary shall withdraw approval of the management program  of any coastal State and shall withdraw financial assistance available  to that State under this title as well as any unexpended portion of such  assistance, if the Secretary determines that the   coastal State has failed to take the actions referred to in paragraph  (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Management program approval and financial assistance may not be  withdrawn under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, unless the  Secretary gives the coastal State notice of the proposed withdrawal and  an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed action. Upon the  withdrawal of management program approval under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of  this section, the Secretary shall provide the coastal State with written  specifications of the actions that should be taken, or not engaged in,  by the State in order that such withdrawal may be canceled by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Assistant Administrator determines that  the State has not taken the actions required in Sec. 923.135(a)(2), the  Assistant Administrator will provide the Governor and the State CZM  program manager with written notice of this finding and NOAA's  obligation to withdraw program approval and financial assistance under  this title. The State will be given 30 days from receipt of this notice  to respond with evidence that it has taken the actions specified  pursuant to Sec. 923.135(a)(2). During this 30-day period, the State  may request up to 30 additional days to respond, for a maximum of 60  days from receipt of notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the State does not respond satisfactorily within the time  allowed, the agency will notify the State of intent to take the proposed  action. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and will  inform the State of its right to a public hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the State does not request a public hearing or submit  satisfactory evidence that it has taken the actions specified pursuant  to Sec. 923.135(a)(2) within 30 days of publication of this notice, and  the Assistant Administrator determines that the State has failed to take  the actions specified pursuant to Sec. 923.135(a)(2), the Assistant  Administrator will withdraw program approval and financial assistance  and will notify the State in writing of the decision and the reasons for  it. The notification will set forth actions that must be taken by the  State which would cause the Assistant Administrator to cancel the  withdrawal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the State requests a public hearing within 30 days of  publication of the notice of intent to withdraw program approval and  financial assistance, the Assistant Administrator will publish 30 days  advance notice of the hearing in the Federal Register and the  newspaper(s) of largest circulation in the State's coastal zone. The  hearing will be held in a location convenient to the citizens of the  State's coastal zone and a record of the hearing will be maintained.  Within 30 days of the completion of the hearing, the agency will make  the determination as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If program approval and financial assistance are withdrawn  pursuant to this section, a notice will be placed in the Federal  Register and Federal consistency under section 307 of the Act will cease  to apply to the State's CZM program.
