                                Sec. 779.262  Excise taxes at the retail level.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal excise taxes are imposed at the retail level on highway  vehicle fuels other than gasoline under the provisions of 26 U.S.C.  4041. Such excise taxes are levied at the retail level on any liquid  fuel sold for use, or used in a diesel-powered highway vehicle. A  similar tax is imposed on the sale of such special motor fuels as  benzene and liquefied petroleum gas when used as a motor fuel. To the  extent that these taxes are separately stated to the customer, they may  be excluded from gross volume of sales. The extent to which State taxes  are levied at the retail level, and thus excludable when separately  stated, depends, of course, upon the law of the State concerned.  However, as a general rule, State, county, and municipal sales taxes are  levied at the retail level, and to the extent that they are separately  stated, may be excluded. All State excise taxes on gasoline are, for  purposes of section 3(s), taxes levied at the retail level, which, if  separately stated, may be excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The circumstances surrounding the levying and collection of the  Federal excise taxes on gasoline, tires, and inner tubes reflect that,  although they are listed under the title of ``Manufacturers Excise  Taxes,'' they are, in practical operation, taxes ``at the retail   level.'' Federal excise taxes on gasoline, tires, and inner tubes, when  ``separately stated,'' may therefore be excluded in computing the annual  gross volume of an enterprise for the purpose of determining coverage  under section 3(s)(1) of the Act and section 13(a)(2) for purposes of  applying the $250,000 test for determining the retail and service  establishment exemption of an establishment in a covered enterprise.</p>
