                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan repayment. For each year of obligated service in a  veterinary shortage situation, as determined by the Secretary, with a  minimum of 3 years   (and maximum of 4 years) of obligated service, the Secretary may pay:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amount not exceeding $25,000 per year of a program  participant's qualifying loans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An additional amount not exceeding $5,000 per year of a program  participant's qualifying loans, if the program participant has already  been selected for participation in the VMLRP and agrees to enter into a  one-year agreement for each year of service to provide up to 60 days of  obligated service to the Federal government in animal health emergency  situations, as determined by the Secretary, provided the shortage  situation in which the participant has agreed to serve has been  designated as suitable for the Federal obligated service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To maximize the number of agreements and to encourage qualified  veterinarians to participate in the VMLRP, the Secretary may establish a  loan repayment cap that differs from the cap established under paragraph  (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section when it is in the best interest of  VMLRP. This will be identified in the RFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary will determine the debt threshold in the RFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loan repayments will be made directly to the loan provider on a  quarterly basis, starting with the end of the first quarter after the  program eligibility date of the service agreement. Tax payments equal to  39 percent of the loan repayments will be credited directly to the  participant's IRS (Federal tax) account simultaneously with each loan  repayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Once a service agreement has been signed by both parties, the  Secretary will obligate such funds as will be necessary to ensure that  sufficient funds will be available to make loan repayments and tax  payments, as specified in the service agreement, for the duration of the  period of obligated service. Reimbursements for tax liabilities in  excess of the amount provided (not to exceed 39 percent of the amount of  loan repayment or any other cap established by the Secretary) will be  subject to the availability of funds. These additional tax payments, if  available to the VMLRP participants, will be identified in the RFA and  in the participant service agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Participants are required to keep payments current on all  qualifying VMLRP loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Travel expenditures. The VMLRP will not reimburse a program  participant for expenses associated with traveling from the program  participant's residence to the prospective practice site for the purpose  of evaluating such site or the expenses of relocating from the program  participant's temporary or permanent residence to a practice site.</p>
