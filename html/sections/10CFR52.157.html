                            <p class="depth0">The application must contain a final safety analysis report containing the information set forth below, with a level of design information sufficient to enable the Commission to judge the applicant's proposed means of assuring that the manufacturing conforms to the design and to reach a final conclusion on all safety questions associated with the design, permit the preparation of construction and installation specifications by an applicant who seeks to use the manufactured reactor, and permit the preparation of acceptance and inspection requirements by the NRC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The principal design criteria for the reactor to be manufactured. Appendix A of 10 CFR part 50, ``General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' establishes minimum requirements for the principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear power plants similar in design and location to plants for which construction permits have previously been issued by the Commission and provides guidance to applicants in establishing principal design criteria for other types of nuclear power units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the principal design criteria;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A description and analysis of the structures, systems, and components of the reactor to be manufactured, with emphasis upon the materials of manufacture, performance requirements, the bases, with technical justification therefor, upon which the performance requirements have been established, and the evaluations required to show that safety functions will be accomplished. The description shall be sufficient to permit understanding of the system designs and their relationship to safety evaluations. Items such as the reactor core, reactor coolant system, instrumentation and control systems, electrical systems, containment system, other engineered safety features, auxiliary and emergency systems, power conversion systems, radioactive waste handling systems, and fuel handling systems shall be discussed insofar as they are pertinent. The following power reactor design characteristics will be taken into consideration by the Commission:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intended use of the manufactured reactor including the proposed maximum power level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are applied to the design of the reactor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability or consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The safety features that are engineered into the reactor and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. Special attention must be directed to reactor design features intended to mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release \11\ from the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, together with applicable postulated site parameters, including site meteorology, to evaluate the offsite radiological consequences. The evaluation must determine that:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual located at any point on the boundary of the exclusion area for any 2 hour period following the onset of the postulated fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem \12\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE);---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with respect to postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the event of an accident.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem TEDE; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The kinds and quantities of radioactive materials expected to be produced in the operation and the means for controlling and limiting radioactive effluents and radiation exposures within the limits set forth in part 20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Information necessary to establish that the design of the reactor to be manufactured complies with the technical requirements in 10 CFR Chapter I, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of structures, systems, and components with the objective of assessing the risk to public health and safety resulting from operation of the facility and including determination of the margins of safety during normal operations and transient conditions anticipated during the life of the facility, and the adequacy of structures, systems, and components provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the consequences of accidents. Analysis and evaluation of ECCS cooling performance and the need for high-point vents following postulated loss-of-coolant accidents shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.46 and 50.46a of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description and analysis of the fire protection design features for the reactor necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 50, appendix A, GDC 3 and Sec. 50.48 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of protection provided against pressurized thermal shock events, including projected values of the reference temperature for reactor vessel beltline materials as defined in Sec.

The description of the quality assurance program must include a discussion of how the applicable requirements of appendix B to 10 CFR part 50 have been and will be satisfied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Proposed technical specifications applicable to the reactor being manufactured, prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.36 and 50.36a of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> The site parameters postulated for the design, and an analysis and evaluation of the reactor design in terms of those site parameters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> The interface requirements between the manufactured reactor and the remaining portions of the nuclear power plant.
