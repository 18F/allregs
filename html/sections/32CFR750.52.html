                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A claim which is disapproved in whole or in part may be appealed  by the claimant at any time within 30 days after receipt of notification  of disapproval. An appeal shall be in writing and state the grounds  relied upon. An appeal is not an adversary proceeding and a hearing is  not authorized; however, the claimant may obtain and submit any  additional evidence or written argument for consideration by the  appellate authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt, the adjudicating authority examines the appeal,  determines whether the appeal complies with this regulation, and reviews  the claims investigative file to ensure it is complete. The claim, with  the complete investigative file and a memorandum of law, will be  forwarded to the appellate authority for action. If the evidence in the  file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal,  indicates the appeal should be approved, the adjudicating authority may  treat the appeal as a request for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Processing of the appeal may be delayed pending further efforts  by the adjudicating authority to settle the claim. Where the  adjudicating authority does not reach a final agreement on an appealed  claim, it shall send the entire claim file to the next higher settlement  authority, who is the appellate authority for that claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The appellate authority shall notify the claimant in writing of  the determination on appeal; that such determination constitutes the  final administrative action on the claim; and there is no right to sue  under the MCA.</p>
