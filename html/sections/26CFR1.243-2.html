In determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), dividends received from a regulated investment company shall be subject to the limitations provided in section 854.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dividends received from real estate investment trusts. See section 857(c) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.857-6 for special rules which deny a deduction under section 243 in the case of dividends received from a real estate investment trust with respect to a taxable year for which such trust is taxable under Part II, Subchapter M, Chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dividends received on preferred stock of a public utility. The deduction allowed by section 243(a) shall be determined without regard to any dividends described in section 244 (relating to dividends on the preferred stock of a public utility). That is, such deduction shall be determined without regard to any dividends received on the preferred stock of a public utility which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code and with respect to which a deduction is allowed by section 247 (relating to dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public utilities). For a deduction with respect to such dividends received on the preferred stock of a public utility, see section 244. If a deduction for dividends paid is not allowable to the distributing corporation under section 247 with respect to the dividends on its preferred stock, such dividends received from a domestic public utility corporation subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code are includible in determining the deduction allowed by section 243(a).
