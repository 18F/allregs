                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ninety percent. SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety for 90%  of the Loss incurred and paid if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount of the Contract at the time of Execution of the  bond is $100,000 or less; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bond was issued on behalf of a small business owned and  controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, on  behalf of a qualified HUBZone small business concern, or on behalf of a  small business owned and controlled by veterans or a small business  owned and controlled by Service-disabled veterans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eighty percent. SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety in an  amount not to exceed 80% of the Loss incurred and paid on bonds for  Contracts in excess of $100,000 which are executed on behalf of non- disadvantaged concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract increase to over $100,000. If the Contract amount  increases to more than $100,000 after Execution of the bond, the  guarantee percentage decreases by one percentage point for each $5,000  of increase or part thereof, but it does not decrease below 80%. This  provision applies only to guarantees which qualify under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contract or Order increases exceed Applicable Statutory Limit.  If the Contract or Order amount is increased above the Applicable  Statutory Limit after Execution of the bond, SBA's share of the Loss is  limited to that percentage of the increased Contract or Order amount  that the Applicable Statutory Limit represents multiplied by the  guarantee percentage approved by SBA. For example, if a contract amount  increases to $6,800,000, SBA's share of the loss under an 80% guarantee  is limited to 76.5% [6,500,000/6,800,000 = 95.6% x 80% = 76.5%].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contract or Order decrease to $100,000 or less. If the Contract  or Order amount decreases to $100,000, or less, after Execution of the  bond, SBA's guarantee percentage increases to 90% if the Surety provides  SBA with evidence supporting the decrease and any other information or  documents requested.
