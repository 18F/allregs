                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 16.406(a), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Incentive Price Revision--Firm Target (OCT 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The supplies or services identified in the Schedule as  Items ---- [Contracting Officer insert Schedule line item numbers] are  subject to price revision in accordance with this clause; provided, that  in no event shall the total final price of these items exceed the  ceiling price of ---- dollars ($----). Any supplies or services that are  to be (1) ordered separately under, or otherwise added to, this contract  and (2) subject to price revision in accordance with the terms of this  clause shall be identified as such in a modification to this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs  in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  in effect on the date of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Data submission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within ---- [Contracting Officer insert  number of days] days after the end of the month in which the Contractor  has delivered the last unit of supplies and completed the services  specified by item number in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor  shall sumbit in the format of Table 15-2, FAR 15.408, or in any other  form on which the parties agree--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A detailed statement of all costs incurred up to the end of that  month in performing all work under the items;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An estimate of costs of further performance, if any, that may  be necessary to complete performance of all work under the items;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A list of all residual inventory and an estimate of its value;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may  reasonably require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by  subparagraph (1) above within the time specified and it is later  determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the  Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless  repaid within 30 days after the end of the data submittal period, the  amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the  data were due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in  accordance with the Interest clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Price revision. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of the  data required by paragraph (c) above, the Contracting Officer and   the Contractor shall promptly establish the total final price of the  items specified in (a) above by applying to final negotiated cost an  adjustment for profit or loss, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the basis of the information required by paragraph (c) above,  together with any other pertinent information, the parties shall  negotiate the total final cost incurred or to be incurred for supplies  delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and  which are subject to price revision under this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total final price shall be established by applying to the  total final negotiated cost an adjustment for profit or loss, as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the total final negotiated cost is equal to the total target  cost, the adjustment is the total target profit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the total final negotiated cost is greater than the total  target cost, the adjustment is the total target profit, less --  [Contracting Officer insert percent] percent of the amount by which the  total final negotiated cost exceeds the total target cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the final negotiated cost is less than the total target  cost, the adjustment is the total target profit plus -- [Contracting  Officer insert percent] percent of the amount by which the total final  negotiated cost is less than the total target cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contract modification. The total final price of the items  specified in paragraph (a) above shall be evidenced by a modification to  this contract, signed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer.  This price shall not be subject to revision, notwithstanding any changes  in the cost of performing the contract, except to the extent that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parties may agree in writing, before the determination of  total final price, to exclude specific elements of cost from this price  and to a procedure for subsequent disposition of those elements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments or credits are explicitly permitted or required by  this or any other clause in this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Adjusting billing prices. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pending execution of the contract  modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit  invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices as provided in  this paragraph. The billing prices shall be the target prices shown in  this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> below that the then-current billing  prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices,  the parties shall negotiate a reduction in the billing prices.  Similarly, the parties may negotiate an increase in billing prices by  any or all of the difference between the target prices and the ceiling  price, upon the Contractor's submission of factual data showing that  final cost under this contract will be substantially greater than the  target cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract  modification and shall not affect the determination of the total final  price under paragraph (d) above. After the contract modification  establishing the total final price is executed, the total amount paid or  to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the  total final price, and any resulting additional payments, refunds, or  credits shall be made promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>  shall apply until final price revision under this contract has been  completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of the Contractor's  fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first  performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for  each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract  administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the  cognizant contract auditor) a statement, cumulative from the beginning  of the contract, showing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services  performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices  have been established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total costs (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably  incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered  (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which  final prices have not been established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The portion of the total target profit (used in establishing  the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this  paragraph (g)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered  (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which  final prices have not been established--increased or decreased in  accordance with subparagraph (d)(2) above, when the amount stated under  subdivision (ii), immediately above, differs from the aggregate target  costs of the supplies or services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies  delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government  (including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress  payments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing  greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under  subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as  computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above,  the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the  amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this  refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the  Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or  credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the   excess has been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then  that portion may, instead of being refunded, be added to the  unliquidated progress payment account consistent with the Progress  Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete details to  support any claimed reductions in refunds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within  45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that  the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay  the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days  after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the  excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly  statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in  accordance with the Interest clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may  provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer  fail to agree upon the total final price within 60 days (or within such  other period as the Contracting Officer may specify) after the date on  which the data required by paragraph (c) above are to be submitted, the  Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with  the Disputes clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Termination. If this contract is terminated before the total  final price is established, prices of supplies or services subject to  price revision shall be established in accordance with this clause for  (1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2)  those supplies and services not terminated under a partial termination.  All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance  with other applicable clauses of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Equitable adjustment under other clauses. If an equitable  adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this  contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment  shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum  dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both.  If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established,  only the total final price shall be adjusted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Exclusion from target price and total final price. If any clause  of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not  include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price  nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that  purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Separate reimbursement. If any clause of this contract expressly  provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at  Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target  price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Taxes. As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or  in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be  included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term contract  price includes the total target price or, if it has been established,  the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the  contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the  obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes  or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target  price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that  it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth2">Alternate I (APR 1984). As prescribed in 16.406(a), add the  following paragraph (o) to the basic clause:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Provisioning and options. Parts, other supplies, or services  that are to be furnished under this contract on the basis of a  provisioning document or Government option shall be subject to price  revision in accordance with this clause. Any prices established for  these parts, other supplies, or services under a provisioning document  or Government option shall be treated as target prices. Target cost and  profit covering these parts, other supplies, or services may be  established separately, in the aggregate, or in any combination, as the  parties may agree.
