They include specific activities or projects related to earthquake hazards reduction which fall into one or more of the following categories: Preparedness and response planning; mitigation planning and implementation, including inventories preparation, seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety; and public awareness and education. The activities that will actually be funded shall be determined through individual negotiations between FEMA and the States (see criteria in Sec. 361.3(3)).</p><p class="depth0">In-kind contributions represent the value of non-cash contributions provided by the States and other non-Federal parties. In-kind contributions may be in the form of charges for real property and non-expendable personal property and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the States' earthquake hazards reduction projects.</p><p class="depth0">Project means the complete set of approved earthquake hazards reduction activities undertaken by a State, or other jurisdiction, on a cost-shared basis with FEMA in a given Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">Project Period is the duration of time over which an earthquake hazards reduction project is implemented.</p><p class="depth0">State refers to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States.

The term also includes assistance to local units of government or substate areas, such as a group of several counties.</p><p class="depth0">Target Allocation is the maximum amount of FEMA earthquake program funds presumably available to an eligible State in a fiscal year. It is based primarily upon the total amount of State assistance funds available to FEMA annually, the number of eligible States, and a nationally standardized comparison of these States' seismic hazard and population-at-risk. The target allocation is not necessarily the amount of funding that a State will actually receive from FEMA. Rather, it represents a planning basis of negotiations between the State and its FEMA Regional Office which will ultimately determine the actual amount of earthquake State assistance to be provided by FEMA.</p>
