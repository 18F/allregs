                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A final decision of the National Futures  Association in a disciplinary action, membership denial action or  registration action shall be effective thirty days after service of the  notice described in Sec. 171.21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petitions for stay pending review or for an emergency effective  date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stay pending review. Within ten days of service of the notice  described in Sec. 171.21, any aggrieved party may seek from the  Commission a stay pending consideration of the merits of an appeal by  filing and serving an appropriate petition. The mere filing of such a  petition shall not stay the effective date of the decision. The burden  of persuasion shall rest with the party seeking the stay. If the  Commission does not grant the petition prior to the effective date of  the decision under review, it shall be deemed denied. All petitions for  stay must be accompanied by a notice of appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emergency effective date. Within ten days of service of the  notice described in Sec. 171.21, the National Futures Association may  seek from the Commission an order establishing an emergency effective  date for the decision by filing and serving an appropriate petition. The  mere filing of such a petition   shall not alter the effective date of the decision. The burden of  persuasion rests with the National Futures Association. If the  Commission does not grant the petition by the date specified as the  emergency effective date, it shall be deemed denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contents of petition for stay and petition for an emergency  effective date. A petition for stay or for an emergency effective date  shall be in writing. Material factual allegations shall be supported by  an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that  the material facts are not in dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Response. Within five days of the service of the petition, a  party may file in opposition to the petition. Material factual  allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement  unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards for determining petitions for a stay or an emergency  effective date petition. In reviewing petitions filed under this  seciton, the Commission shall consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The likelihood that a challenge to the merits of the decision  will be successful; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in  irreparable harm to the petitioner; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The effect a grant of the petition would have on the opposing  party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the  public interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited consideration. If, in its view, it is necessary to  protect the petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the  issues raised in the petition, the Commission may act upon a petition  for a stay or for an emergency effective date prior to its receipt of an  opposing party's response. Any party aggrieved by such expedited  consideration may seek reconsideration within seven days of service of  the decision.</p>
