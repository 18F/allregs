                                Sec. 536.50  Determination of damages--applicable law.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal Tort Claims Act. The whole law of the place where  the incident giving rise to the claim occurred, including choice of law  rules, is applicable. Therefore, the law of the place of injury or death  does not necessarily apply. Where there is a conflict between local law  and an express provision of the FTCA, the latter governs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Military Claims Act or National Guard Claims Act. See  subparts C and F of this part. The law set forth in Sec. 536.80 applies  only to claims accruing on or after September 1, 1995. The law of the   place of the incident giving rise to the claim will apply to claims  arising in the United States, its commonwealths, territories and  possessions prior to September 1, 1995. The general principles of U.S.  tort law will apply to property damage or loss claims arising outside  the United States prior to September 1, 1995. Established principles of  general maritime law will apply to injury or death claims arising  outside the United States prior to September 1, 1995. See Moragne v.  States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375 (1970) and federal case law.  Where general maritime law provides no guidance, the general principles  of U.S. tort law will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Foreign Claims Act. See subpart J of this part. The law of  the place of occurrence applies to the resolution of claims. However,  the law of damages set forth in Sec. 536.139 will serve as a guide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act. Maritime law applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Damages not payable. Under all subparts, property loss or damage  refers to actual tangible property. Accordingly, consequential damages,  including, but not limited to bail, interest (prejudgment or otherwise),  or court costs are not payable. Costs of preparing, filing, and pursuing  a claim, including expert witness fees, are not payable. The payment of  punitive damages, that is, damages in addition to general and special  damages that are otherwise payable, is prohibited. See DA Pam 27-162,  paragraphs 2-56 and 3-4b.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Source of attorney's fees. Attorney's fees are taken from the  settlement amount and not added thereto. They may not exceed 20 percent  of the settlement amount under any subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.50: For further discussion see DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-51.</p>
