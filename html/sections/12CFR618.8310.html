                                Sec. 618.8310  Lists of borrowers and stockholders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any System institution, for the purpose of protecting the  security position of the institution, may provide lists of borrowers to  buyers, warehousemen, and others who deal in produce or livestock of the  kind that   secures such loans, except to the extent such actions are prohibited by  State laws adopted in accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985,  Pub. L. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1354. Lists of borrowers or stockholders shall  not otherwise be released by any bank or association except in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 7 days after receipt of a written request by a  stockholder, each Farm Credit bank or association must provide a current  list of its stockholders' names, addresses, and classes of stock held to  such requesting stockholder. As a condition to providing the list, the  bank or association may only require that the stockholder agree and  certify in writing that the stockholder will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Utilize the list exclusively for communicating with stockholders  for permissible purposes; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not make the list available to any person, other than the  stockholder's attorney or accountant, without first obtaining the  written consent of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an alternative to receiving a list of stockholders, a  stockholder may request the institution mail or otherwise furnish to  each stockholder a communication for a permissible purpose on behalf of  the requesting stockholder. This alternative may be used at the  discretion of the requesting stockholder, provided that the requester  agrees to defray the reasonable costs of the communication. In the event  the requester decides to exercise this option, the institution must  provide the requester with a written estimate of the costs of handling  and mailing the communication as soon as practicable after receipt of  the stockholder's request to furnish a communication. However, a  stockholder may not exercise this option when requesting the list to  distribute campaign material for election to the institution board or  board committees. Farm Credit banks and associations are prohibited from  distributing or mailing campaign material under Sec. 611.320(e) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section ``permissible  purpose'' is defined to mean matters relating to the business operations  of the institutions. This includes matters relating to the effectiveness  of management, the use of institution assets, the distribution by  stockholder candidates of campaign material for election to the  institution board or board committees, and the performance of directors  and officers. This does not include communications involving commercial,  social, political, or charitable causes, communications relating to the  enforcement of a personal claim or the redress of a personal grievance,  or proposals advocating that the bank or association violate any  Federal, State, or local law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In connection with preparing and submitting an electronic report  of all System accounts and exposures to the Farm Credit Administration  in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 621.15 of this chapter, each  bank and association may provide information from its lists of borrowers  and stockholders to the Reporting Entity as defined in Sec. 621.2 of  this chapter.
