                            <p class="depth0">Western's resource acquisition activities will be determined by project-specific power marketing plans, hydropower production capability, and the application of the following principles of IRP:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Western will consider a full range of resource options, both supply-side and demand-side, as well as renewable resource options.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On a project-by-project basis, Western, through a public process involving interested stakeholders will develop criteria to be used in evaluating power resource alternatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation criteria will address cost, environmental impact, dependability, dispatchability, risk, diversity, and the ability to verify demand-side alternatives. Evaluation criteria will be reviewed as the need for resources changes or when long-term commitments to purchase power expire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation criteria will be consistent with Western's power marketing policy, which states that Federal power is to be marketed in such a manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles. The policy, found in Delegation Order No. 00-037.00A, is derived from statutes authorizing the sale of power from both Department of the Army and Department of the Interior hydroelectric projects. These statutes include section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825(s) and section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Resource acquisition planning will be consistent with power marketing plans and associated contractual obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Resource acquisition decisions will be documented and made available to Western's power customers and the public.</p>
