                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assessments will be levied only upon handlers who first handle  pears. Each handler shall pay assessments on all pears handled by such  handler as the pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds  are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Fresh Pear Committee or  the Processed Pear Committee during a fiscal period. The payment of  assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Fresh Pear  Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may be required under this  part throughout the period such assessments are payable irrespective of  whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become  inoperative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> to secure  sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under Sec. 927.47.  At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis  of a Fresh Pear Committee recommendation or other information that  different rates are necessary for fresh pears or for any varieties or  subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and  such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties that  are shipped during the fiscal period for fresh market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based upon a recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or  other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of  assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for  processing during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include one  rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears  classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all  varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate  of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears  classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee  or other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates  of assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within  the assessment classifications defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section to secure sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized  under Sec. 927.47. At any time during the fiscal period when it is  determined on the basis of a Processed Pear Committee recommendation   or other information that different rates are necessary for pears for  processing or for any varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may  modify those rates of assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or  all varieties or subvarieties of pears that are shipped during the  fiscal period for processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based on the recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee, the  Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may  establish additional base rates of assessments, or change or modify the  base rate classifications defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may  impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay any  assessment within the time prescribed. In the event the handler  thereafter fails to pay the amount outstanding, including the late  payment charge, within the prescribed time, the Fresh Pear Committee or  the Processed Pear Committee may impose an additional charge in the form  of interest on such outstanding amount. The Fresh Pear Committee or the  Processed Pear Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall  prescribe the amount of such late payment charge and rate of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the  Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee prior to  commencement of shipments in any season, handlers may make advance  payments of assessments, which advance payments shall be credited to  such handlers and the assessments of such handlers shall be adjusted so  that such assessments are based upon the quantity of each variety or  subvariety of pears handled by such handlers during such season.  Further, payment discounts may be authorized by the Fresh Pear Committee  or the Processed Pear Committee upon the approval of the Secretary to  handlers making such advance assessment payments.</p>
