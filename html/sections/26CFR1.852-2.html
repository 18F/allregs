                                Sec. 1.852-2  Method of taxation of regulated investment companies.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of normal tax and surtax. Section 852(b)(1) imposes a normal tax and surtax, computed at the rates and in the manner prescribed in section 11, on the investment company taxable income, as defined in section 852(b)(2) and Sec. 1.852-3, for each taxable year of a regulated investment company. The tax is imposed as if the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In computing the normal tax under section 11, the regulated investment company's taxable income and the dividends paid deduction (computed without regard to the capital gains dividends) shall both be reduced by the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Taxation of capital gains--(1) In general. Section 852(b)(3)(A) imposes (i) in the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a tax of 25 percent, or (ii) in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, a tax determined as provided in section 1201(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.1201-1, on the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital gain of a regulated investment company (subject to tax under part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code) over the sum of its net short-term capital loss and its deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only. For the definition of capital gain dividend paid by a regulated investment company, see section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.852-4. In the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, such deduction for dividends paid shall first be made from the amount subject to tax in accordance with section 1201(a)(1)(B), to the extent thereof, and then from the amount subject to tax in accordance with section 1201(a)(1)(A). See Sec. 1.852-10, relating to certain distributions in redemption of interests in unit investment trusts which, for purposes of the deduction for dividends paid with reference to capital gain dividends only, are not considered preferential dividends under section 562(c). See section 855 and Sec. 1.855-1, relating to dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 852(b)(3)(A) imposes (i) in the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a tax of 25 percent, or (ii) in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, a tax determined as provided in section 1201(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.1201-1, on the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital gain of a regulated investment company (subject to tax under part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code) over the sum of its net short-term capital loss and its deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.

A regulated investment company (subject to tax under part I of subchapter M) may, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1956, designate under section 852(b)(3)(D) an amount of undistributed capital gains to each shareholder of the company. For the definition of the term ``undistributed capital gains'' and for the treatment of such amounts by a shareholder, see paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.852-4. For the rules relating to the method of making such designation, the returns to be filed, and the payment of the tax in such cases, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.852-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

If a regulated investment company designates an amount as undistributed capital gains for a taxable year, the earnings and profits of such regulated investment company for such taxable year shall be reduced by the total amount of the undistributed capital gains so designated.
