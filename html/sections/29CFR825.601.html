                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year and  begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively rather than  intermittently. The period during the summer vacation when the employee  would not have   been required to report for duty is not counted against the employee's  FMLA leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA leave  at the end of the school year must be provided with any benefits over  the summer vacation that employees would normally receive if they had  been working at the end of the school year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an eligible instructional employee needs intermittent leave  or leave on a reduced leave schedule to care for a family member with a  serious health condition, to care for a covered servicemember, or for  the employee's own serious health condition, which is foreseeable based  on planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for  more than 20 percent of the total number of working days over the period  the leave would extend, the employer may require the employee to choose  either to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Take leave for a period or periods of a particular duration, not  greater than the duration of the planned treatment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer temporarily to an available alternative position for  which the employee is qualified, which has equivalent pay and benefits  and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the  employee's regular position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These rules apply only to a leave involving more than 20 percent  of the working days during the period over which the leave extends. For  example, if an instructional employee who normally works five days each  week needs to take two days of FMLA leave per week over a period of  several weeks, the special rules would apply. Employees taking leave  which constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the  leave period would not be subject to transfer to an alternative  position. Periods of a particular duration means a block, or blocks, of  time beginning no earlier than the first day for which leave is needed  and ending no later than the last day on which leave is needed, and may  include one uninterrupted period of leave.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an instructional employee does not give required notice of  foreseeable FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.302) to be taken intermittently or  on a reduced leave schedule, the employer may require the employee to  take leave of a particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an  alternative position. Alternatively, the employer may require the  employee to delay the taking of leave until the notice provision is met.</p>
