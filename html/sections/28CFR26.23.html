                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An appropriate State official may request in writing that the  Attorney General determine whether the State meets the requirements for  certification under Sec.  26.22 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a State's request for certification, the  Attorney General will make the request publicly available on the  Internet (including any supporting materials included in the request)  and publish a notice in the Federal Register--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indicating that the State has requested certification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identifying the Internet address at which the public may view  the State's request for certification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Soliciting public comment on the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State's request will be reviewed by the Attorney General.  The review will include consideration of timely public comments received  in response to the Federal Register notice under paragraph (b) of this  section, or any subsequent notice the Attorney General may publish  providing a further opportunity for comment. The certification will be  published in the Federal Register if certification is granted. The  certification will include a determination of the date the capital  counsel mechanism qualifying the State for certification was  established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certification by the Attorney General reflects the Attorney  General's determination that the State capital counsel mechanism  reviewed under paragraph (c) of this section satisfies chapter 154's  requirements. A State may request a new certification by the Attorney  General to ensure the continued applicability of chapter 154 to cases in  which State postconviction proceedings occur after a change or alleged  change in the State's certified capital counsel mechanism. Changes in a  State's capital counsel mechanism do not affect the applicability of  chapter 154 in any case in which a mechanism certified by the Attorney  General existed throughout State postconviction proceedings in the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A certification remains effective for a period of five years  after the completion of the certification process by the Attorney  General and any related judicial review. If a State requests re- certification at or before the end of that five-year period, the  certification remains effective for an additional period extending until  the completion of the re-certification process by the Attorney General  and any related judicial review.</p>
