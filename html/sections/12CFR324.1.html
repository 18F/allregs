                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part 324 establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for FDIC-supervised institutions. This part 324 includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part 324.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation of authority. Nothing in this part 324 shall be read to limit the authority of the FDIC to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound

practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards. Each FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory capital. Each FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-weighted assets. (i) Each FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk FDIC-supervised institution) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk FDIC-supervised institution) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of this part for a market risk FDIC-supervised institution) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disclosures. (i) Except for an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each FDIC-supervised institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except for an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each FDIC-supervised institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each market risk FDIC-supervised institution must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution must make the public disclosures described in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reservation of authority. (1) Additional capital in the aggregate. The FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the FDIC determines that the FDIC-supervised institution's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the FDIC-supervised institution's credit, market, operational, or other risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Additional capital in the aggregate. The FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the FDIC determines that the FDIC-supervised institution's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the FDIC-supervised institution's credit, market, operational, or other risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory capital elements. (i) If the FDIC determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the FDIC determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments set forth in subpart C of this part, the FDIC may find that a capital element may be included in an FDIC-supervised institution's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with Sec. 324.20(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-weighted asset amounts. If the FDIC determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the FDIC-supervised institution for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Total leverage. If the FDIC determines that the total leverage exposure, or the amount reflected in the FDIC-supervised institution's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by an FDIC-supervised institution under Sec. 324.10 is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the FDIC-supervised institution, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consolidation of certain exposures. The FDIC may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the FDIC-supervised institution's balance sheet is not commensurate with the

risk of the exposure or the relationship of the FDIC-supervised institution to the entity. Upon making this determination, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the FDIC-supervised institution for purposes of determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The FDIC will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the FDIC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other reservation of authority. With respect to any deduction or limitation required under this part, the FDIC may require a different deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the FDIC-supervised institution's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice and response procedures. In making a determination under this section, the FDIC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner as the notice and response procedures in Sec. 324.5(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Timing. (1) Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of this part, an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that is not a savings and loan holding company must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of this part, an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that is not a savings and loan holding company must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, beginning on January 1, 2014, calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart E and, if applicable, subpart F of this part and, beginning on January 1, 2015, calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D and, if applicable, subpart F of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate risk-weighted assets in accordance with the general risk-based capital rules under 12 CFR part 325, appendix A, and, if applicable appendix C (state nonmember banks), or 12 CFR part 390, subpart Z and, if applicable, 12 CFR part 325, appendix C (state savings associations) \1\ and substitute such risk-weighted assets for standardized total risk-weighted assets for purposes of Sec. 324.10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For the purpose of calculating its general risk-based capital ratios from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution shall adjust, as appropriate, its risk-weighted asset measure (as that amount is calculated under 12 CFR part 325, appendix A, (state nonmember banks), and 12 CFR part 390, subpart Z (state savings associations) in the general risk-based capital rules) by excluding those assets that are deducted from its regulatory capital under Sec. 324.22.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If applicable, calculate general market risk equivalent assets in accordance with 12 CFR part 325, appendix C, section 4(a)(3) and substitute such general market risk equivalent assets for standardized market risk-weighted assets for purposes of Sec. 324.20(d)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Substitute the corresponding provision or provisions of 12 CFR part 325, appendix A, and, if applicable, appendix C (state nonmember banks), and 12 CFR part 390, subpart Z and, if applicable, 12 CFR part 325, appendix C (state savings associations) for any reference to subpart D of this part in:Sec. 324.121(c);Sec. 324.124(a) and (b);Sec. 324.144(b);Sec. 324.154(c) and (d);Sec. 324.202(b) (definition of covered position in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)); and Sec. 324.211(b); \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ In addition, for purposes of Sec. 324.201(c)(3), from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, for any circumstance in which the FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under subpart D of this part, the FDIC will instead require the FDIC-supervised institution to make such calculations according to 12 CFR part 325, appendix A, and, if applicable, appendix C (state nonmember banks), or 12 CFR part 390, subpart Z and, if applicable, 12 CFR part 325, appendix C (state savings associations).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Beginning on January 1, 2014, calculate and maintain minimum capital ratios in accordance with subparts A, B, and C of this part, provided, however, that such FDIC-supervised institution must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 5.5 percent, a minimum total capital
