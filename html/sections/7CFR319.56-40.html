                            <p class="depth0">Fresh peppers (Capsicum spp.) may be imported into the United States  from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama  only under the following conditions and in accordance with all other  applicable provisions of this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For peppers of the species Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens,  Capsicum baccatum, and Capsicum chinense from areas free of  Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), terms of entry are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The peppers must be grown and packed in an area that has been  determined by APHIS to be free of Medfly in accordance with the  procedures described in Sec. 319.56-5 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A pre-harvest inspection of the growing site must be conducted  by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting  country for those pests listed in the bilateral workplan provided to  APHIS by the NPPO of the exporting country, including any of the  following pests: The weevil Faustinus ovatipennis, pea leafminer, tomato  fruit borer, lantana mealybug, passionvine mealybug, melon thrips,  bacterial wilt, the rust fungus Puccinia pampeana, Andean potato mottle  virus, and tomato severe leaf curl virus. If any of the pests listed in  the workplan are found to be generally infesting the growing site, the  NPPO may not allow export from that production site until the NPPO has  determined that risk mitigation has been achieved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The peppers must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers  or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin at the  packinghouse for transit to the United States. These safeguards must  remain intact until arrival in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exporting country's NPPO is responsible for export  certification, inspection, and issuance of phytosanitary certificates.  Each consignment of peppers must be accompanied by a phytosanitary  certificate issued by the NPPO and bearing the declaration,   ``These peppers were grown in an area recognized to be free of Medfly  and the consignment has been inspected and found free of the pests  listed in the requirements.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For peppers of the species Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens,  Capsicum baccatum, Capsicum chinense, and Capsicum pubescens from areas  in which Medfly is considered to exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The peppers must be grown in approved production sites  registered with the NPPO of the exporting country. Initial approval of  the production sites will be completed jointly by the exporting  country's NPPO and APHIS. The exporting country's NPPO will visit and  inspect the production sites monthly, starting 2 months before harvest  and continuing through until the end of the shipping season. APHIS may  monitor the production sites at any time during this period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pepper production sites must consist of pest-exclusionary  greenhouses, which must have double self-closing doors and have all  other openings and vents covered with 1.6 mm (or less) screening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Registered sites must contain traps for the detection of Medfly  both within and around the production site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Traps with an approved protein bait must be placed inside the  greenhouses at a density of four traps per hectare, with a minimum of  two traps per greenhouse. Traps must be serviced on a weekly basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a single Medfly is detected inside a registered production  site or in a consignment, the registered production site will lose its  ability to export peppers to the United States until APHIS and the  exporting country's NPPO mutually determine that risk mitigation is  achieved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Medfly traps with an approved lure must be placed inside a  buffer area 500 meters wide around the registered production site, at a  density of 1 trap per 10 hectares and a minimum of 10 traps. These traps  must be checked at least every 7 days. At least one of these traps must  be near the greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before  export and trapping must continue to the end of the harvest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Capture of 0.7 or more Medflies per trap per week will delay or  suspend the harvest, depending on whether harvest has begun, for  consignments of peppers from that production site until APHIS and the  exporting country's NPPO can agree that the pest risk has been  mitigated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The greenhouse must be inspected prior to harvest for those  pests listed in the bilateral workplan provided to APHIS by the NPPO of  the exporting country, including any of the following pests: The weevil  Faustinus ovatipennis, pea leafminer, tomato fruit borer, lantana  mealybug, passionvine mealybug, melon thrips, bacterial wilt, the rust  fungus Puccinia pampeana, Andean potato mottle virus, and tomato severe  leaf curl virus. If any of pests listed in the workplan, or other  quarantine pests, are found to be generally infesting the greenhouse,  export from that production site will be halted until the exporting  country's NPPO determines that the pest risk has been mitigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exporting country's NPPO must maintain records of trap  placement, checking of traps, and any Medfly captures. The exporting  country's NPPO must maintain an APHIS-approved quality control program  to monitor or audit the trapping program. The trapping records must be  maintained for APHIS' review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The peppers must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a pest- exclusionary packinghouse. The peppers must be safeguarded by an insect- proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the  packinghouse and while awaiting packing. Peppers must be packed in  insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or  plastic tarpaulin, for transit to the United States. These safeguards  must remain intact until arrival in the United States or the consignment  will be denied entry into the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting peppers  to the United States, the packinghouse may accept peppers only from  registered approved production sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The exporting country's NPPO is responsible for export  certification, inspection, and issuance of phytosanitary certificates.  Each consignment of peppers must be accompanied by a   phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO and bearing the  declaration, ``These peppers were grown in an approved production site  and the consignment has been inspected and found free of the pests  listed in the requirements.'' The shipping box must be labeled with the  identity of the production site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For peppers of the species Capsicum pubescens from areas in  which Mexican fruit fly (Mexfly) is considered to exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The peppers must be grown in approved production sites  registered with the NPPO of the exporting country.
