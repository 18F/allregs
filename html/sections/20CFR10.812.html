                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A physician or other provider whose charge for service is only partially paid because it exceeds a maximum allowable amount set by the Director may, within 30 days, request reconsideration of the fee determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider should make such a request to the OWCP district office with jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The request must be accompanied by documentary evidence that the procedure performed was incorrectly identified by the original code, that the presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult, or that the provider possessed unusual qualifications. In itself, board-certification in a specialty is not sufficient evidence of unusual qualifications to justify an exception. These are the only three circumstances which will justify reevaluation of the paid amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of OWCP district offices and their respective areas of jurisdiction is available upon request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Washington, DC 20210, or from the Internet at http://www.dol.gov./owcp. Within 30 days of receiving the request for reconsideration, the OWCP district office shall respond in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the OWCP district office issues a decision which continues to disallow a contested amount, the provider may apply to the Regional Director of the region with jurisdiction over the OWCP district office. The application must be filed within 30 days of the date of such decision, and it may be accompanied by additional evidence. Within 60 days of receipt of such application, the Regional Director shall issue a decision in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted. This decision shall be final, and shall not be subject to further review.</p>
