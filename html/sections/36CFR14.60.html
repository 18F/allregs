When an application is not required under the provisions of this subparagraph, qualified persons may appropriate rights-of-way for such usual highway facilities with the consent of the holder of the highway right-of-way, which holder will be responsible for compliance with Sec. 14.9, in connection with the construction and maintenance of such facilities.</p>
