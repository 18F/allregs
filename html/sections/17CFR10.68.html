                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for and issuance of subpoenas--(1) Application for and issuance of subpoena ad testificandum. Any party may apply to the Administrative Law Judge for the issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and testify (subpoena ad testificandum) at the hearing. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. A subpoena ad testificandum shall be issued upon a showing by the requesting party of the general relevance of the testimony being sought and the tender of

an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for and issuance of subpoena ad testificandum.

An application for a subpoena requiring a person to produce specified documentary or tangible evidence (subpoena duces tecum) at any designated time or place may be made by any party to the Administrative Law Judge. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. Except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth, each application for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence being sought and be accompanied by an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, which shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standards for issuance of subpoena duces tecum. The Administrative Law Judge considering any application for a subpoena duces tecum shall issue the subpoena requested if he is satisfied the application complies with this section and the request is not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena duces tecum and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of any subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Denial of application. In the event the Administrative Law Judge determines that a requested subpoena or any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he may refuse to issue the subpoena, or may issue it only upon such conditions as he determines fairness requires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special requirements relating to application for and issuance of subpoenas for commission records and for the appearance of commission employees or employees of other agencies--(1) Form. An application for the issuance of subpoena shall be made in the form of a written motion served upon all other parties, if the subpoena would require</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. An application for the issuance of subpoena shall be made in the form of a written motion served upon all other parties, if the subpoena would require</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The production of documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Commission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of the Commission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of any other state or federal agency in his official capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content. The motion shall specifically describe the material to be produced, the information to be disclosed, or the testimony to be elicited from the witness, and shall show</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The relevance of the material, information, or testimony to the matters at issue in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reasonableness of the scope of the proposed subpoena; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That such material, information, or testimony is not available from other sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rulings. The motion shall be decided by the Administrative Law Judge and shall provide such terms or conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information or the appearance of the witness as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commission review of rulings. Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling made under this section may be sought in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 10.101 without certification by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motions to quash subpoenas; protective orders--(1) Application. Within 10 days after a subpoena has been served or at any time prior to the return date thereof, a motion to quash or modify the subpoena or for a protective order limiting the use or disclosure of any information, documents or testimony

covered by the subpoena may be filed with the Administrative Law Judge who issued it. At the same time, a copy of the motion shall be served on the party who requested the subpoena and all other parties to the proceeding. The motion shall include a brief statement setting forth the basis for the requested relief. If the Administrative Law Judge to whom the motion has been directed has not acted upon the motion by the return date, the subpoena shall be stayed pending his or her final action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application. Within 10 days after a subpoena has been served or at any time prior to the return date thereof, a motion to quash or modify the subpoena or for a protective order limiting the use or disclosure of any information, documents or testimony

covered by the subpoena may be filed with the Administrative Law Judge who issued it. At the same time, a copy of the motion shall be served on the party who requested the subpoena and all other parties to the proceeding. The motion shall include a brief statement setting forth the basis for the requested relief. If the Administrative Law Judge to whom the motion has been directed has not acted upon the motion by the return date, the subpoena shall be stayed pending his or her final action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disposition. After due notice to the person upon whose request the subpoena was issued, and after opportunity for response by that person, the Administrative Law Judge may (i) quash or modify the subpoena, or (ii) condition denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon just and reasonable terms, including, in the case of a subpoena duces tecum, a requirement that the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall advance the reasonable cost of producing documentary or other tangible evidence. The Administrative Law Judge may issue a protective order sought under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or under any other section of these rules upon a showing of good cause. In considering whether good cause exists to issue a protective order, the Administrative Law Judge shall weigh the harm resulting from disclosure against the benefits of disclosure. Good cause shall only be established upon a showing that the person seeking the protective order will suffer a clearly defined and serious injury if the order is not issued, provided, however, that any such injury shall be balanced against the public's right of access to judicial records. No protective order shall be granted that will prevent the Division of Enforcement or any respondent from adequate presenting its case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attendance and mileage fees. Persons summoned to testify either by deposition or at a hearing under requirement of subpoena are entitled to the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees and mileage are paid by the party at whose instance the persons are called.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service of subpoenas--(1) How effected. Service of a subpoena upon a party shall be made in accordance with Sec. 10.12(a) of these rules except that only one copy of a subpoena need be served. Service of a subpoena upon any other person shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to him as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, as applicable, and by tendering to him or her the fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. When the subpoena is issued at the instance of the Commission, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How effected.

Upon failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued at the request of a party, that party may petition the Commission in its discretion to institute an action in an appropriate U.S. District Court for enforcement of that

subpoena. When instituting an action to enforce a subpoena requested by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission, in its discretion, may delegate to the Director of the Division or any Commission employee designated by the Director and acting under his or her direction, or to any other employee of the Commission, authority to serve as the Commission's counsel in such subpoena enforcement action.
