                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``separate proceeding'' includes, but is not limited to, court-martial, non-judicial punishment, administrative board, or similar civilian or military proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases in which a covered attorney is determined, at a separate proceeding determined by the Rules Counsel to afford procedural protection equal to that provided by a preliminary inquiry under this instruction, to have committed misconduct which forms the basis for ethics charges under this instruction, the Rules Counsel may dispense with the preliminary inquiry and proceed directly with an ethics investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In those cases in which a covered attorney is determined to have committed misconduct at a separate proceeding which the Rules Counsel determines has afforded procedural protection equal to that provided by an ethics investigation under this instruction, the previous determination regarding the underlying misconduct is res judicata with respect to that issue during an ethics investigation. A subsequent ethics investigation based on such misconduct shall afford the covered attorney a hearing into whether the underlying misconduct constitutes a violation of this part, whether the violation affects his or her fitness to practice law, and what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Rules Counsel may dispense with the preliminary inquiry and ethics investigation, and if warranted, recommend to JAG that the covered attorney concerned be disciplined, consistent with this subpart, after providing the covered attorney concerned

written notice and an opportunity to be heard in writing, in those cases in which a covered attorney has been:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Decertified or suspended from the practice of law or otherwise subjected to professional responsibility discipline by the Judge Advocate General of another Military Department;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disbarred or suspended from the practice of law or otherwise subjected to professional responsibility discipline by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces or by any Federal, State, or local bar; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Convicted of a felony (or any offense punishable by one year or more of imprisonment) in a civilian or military court which, in the opinion of the Rules Counsel, renders the attorney unqualified or incapable of properly or ethically representing the DON or a client when the Rules Counsel has determined that the attorney was afforded procedural protection equal to that provided by an ethics investigation under this instruction.</p>
