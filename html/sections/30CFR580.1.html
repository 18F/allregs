The coastal zone extends seaward to the outer limit of the United States territorial sea and extends inland from the shorelines to the extent necessary to control shorelands, the uses of which have a direct and significant impact on the coastal waters, and the inward boundaries of which may be identified by the several coastal States, under the authority in section 305(b)(1)

These investigations would involve gathering and analyzing geological, geochemical, or geophysical data and information that are made available to the public for inspection and reproduction at the earliest practical time. The term does not include commercial G&G; exploration or commercial G&G; prospecting activities.</p><p class="depth0">Geological data and information means data and information gathered through or derived from geological and geochemical techniques, e.g., coring and test drilling, well logging, bottom sampling, or other physical sampling or chemical testing process.</p><p class="depth0">Geological sample means a collected portion of the seabed, the subseabed, or the overlying waters acquired while conducting prospecting or scientific research activities.</p><p class="depth0">Geophysical data and information means any data or information gathered through or derived from geophysical measurement or sensing techniques (e.g., gravity, magnetic, or seismic).</p><p class="depth0">Governor means the Governor of a State or the person or entity lawfully designated by or under State law to exercise the powers granted to a Governor under the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Hard minerals mean any minerals found on or below the surface of the seabed except for oil, gas, or sulphur.</p><p class="depth0">Interpreted geological information means the knowledge, often in the form of schematic cross sections, 3-dimensional representations, and maps, developed by determining the geological significance of geological data and analyzed and processed geologic information.</p><p class="depth0">Interpreted geophysical information means knowledge, often in the form of seismic cross sections, 3-dimensional representations, and maps, developed by determining the geological significance of geophysical data and processed geophysical information.</p><p class="depth0">Lease means, depending upon the requirements of the context, either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An agreement issued under section 8 or maintained under section 6 of the Act that authorizes mineral exploration, development and production; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The area covered by an agreement specified in paragraph (1) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Material remains means physical evidence of human habitation, occupation, use, or activity, including the site, location, or context in which evidence is situated.</p><p class="depth0">Minerals mean all minerals authorized by an Act of Congress to be produced from ``public lands'' as defined in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).
