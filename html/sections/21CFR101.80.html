                                Sec. 101.80  Health claims: dietary noncariogenic carbohydrate

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Relationship between dietary carbohydrates and dental caries. (1) Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a disease caused by many factors. Both environmental and genetic factors can affect the development of dental caries. Risk factors include tooth enamel crystal structure and mineral content, plaque quantity and quality, saliva quantity and quality, individual immune response, types and physical characteristics of foods consumed, eating behaviors, presence of acid producing oral bacteria, and cultural influences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a disease caused by many factors. Both environmental and genetic factors can affect the development of dental caries. Risk factors include tooth enamel crystal structure and mineral content, plaque quantity and quality, saliva quantity and quality, individual immune response, types and physical characteristics of foods consumed, eating behaviors, presence of acid producing oral bacteria, and cultural influences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relationship between consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, i.e., dietary sugars and starches, and tooth decay is well established. Sucrose, also known as sugar, is one of the most, but not the only, cariogenic sugars in the diet. Bacteria found in the mouth are able to metabolize most dietary carbohydrates, producing acid and forming dental plaque. The more frequent and longer the exposure of teeth to dietary sugars and starches, the greater the risk for tooth decay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dental caries continues to affect a large proportion of Americans. Although there has been a decline in the prevalence of dental caries among children in the United States, the disease remains widespread throughout the population, imposing a substantial burden on Americans. Recent Federal government dietary guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets that are moderate in sugars and avoid excessive snacking. Frequent between-meal snacks that are high in sugars and starches may be more harmful to teeth than eating such foods at meals and then brushing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, such as sugar alcohols, can be used to replace dietary sugars, such as sucrose and corn sweeteners, in foods such as chewing gums and certain confectioneries. Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners are significantly less cariogenic than dietary sugars and other fermentable carbohydrates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Significance of the relationship between noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries. Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners do not promote dental caries. The noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are slowly metabolized by bacteria to form some acid. The rate and amount of acid production is significantly less than that from sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates and does not cause the loss of important minerals from tooth enamel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements. (1) All requirements set forth in Sec. 101.14 shall be met, except that noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from Sec. 101.14(e)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All requirements set forth in Sec. 101.14 shall be met, except that noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from Sec. 101.14(e)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific requirements--(i) Nature of the claim. A health claim relating noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, compared to other carbohydrates, and the nonpromotion of dental caries may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nature of the claim. A health claim relating noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, compared to other carbohydrates, and the nonpromotion of dental caries may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The claim shall state that frequent between-meal consumption of foods high in sugars and starches can promote tooth decay.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The claim shall state that the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener present in the food ``does not promote,'' ``may reduce the risk of,'' ``useful [or is useful] in not promoting,'' or ``expressly [or is expressly] for not promoting'' dental caries.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall state ``sugar alcohol,'' ``sugar alcohols,'' or the name or

names of the substances listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, e.g., ``sorbitol.'' D-tagatose may be identified as ``tagatose.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: ``dental caries'' or ``tooth decay.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The claim shall not attribute any degree of the reduction in risk of dental caries to the use of the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing food.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The claim shall not imply that consuming noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods is the only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of dental caries.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Packages with less than 15 square inches of surface area available for labeling are exempt from paragraphs (A) and (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> When the substance that is the subject of the claim is a noncariogenic sugar, the claim shall identify the substance as a sugar that, unlike other sugars, does not promote the development of dental caries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nature of the substance. Eligible noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The sugar alcohols xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, lactitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, hydrogenated glucose syrups, and erythritol, or a combination of these.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sugars D-tagatose and isomaltulose.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Sucralose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nature of the food. (A) The food shall meet the requirement in Sec. 101.60(c)(1)(i) with respect to sugars content, except that the food may contain D-tagatose or isomaltulose.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The food shall meet the requirement in Sec. 101.60(c)(1)(i) with respect to sugars content, except that the food may contain D-tagatose or isomaltulose.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A food whose labeling includes a health claim under this section shall contain one or more of the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When carbohydrates other than those listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are present in the food, the food shall not lower plaque pH below 5.7 by bacterial fermentation either during consumption or up to 30 minutes after consumption, as measured by the indwelling plaque pH test found in ``Identification of Low Caries Risk Dietary Components,'' dated 1983, by T. N. Imfeld, in Volume 11, Monographs in Oral Science, 1983.
