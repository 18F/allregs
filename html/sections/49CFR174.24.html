                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person may not accept a hazardous material for transportation  or transport a hazardous material by rail unless that person receives a  shipping paper prepared in accordance with part 172 of this subchapter,  unless the material is excepted from shipping paper requirements under  this subchapter. Only an initial carrier within the United States must  receive and retain a copy of the shipper's certification as required by  Sec. 172.204 of this subchapter. This section does not apply to a  material that is excepted from shipping paper requirements by this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each person receiving a shipping paper required by this section  must retain a copy or an electronic image thereof, that is accessible at  or through its principal place of business and must make the shipping  paper available, upon request, to an authorized official of a Federal,  State, or local government agency at reasonable times and locations. For  a hazardous waste, each shipping paper copy must be retained for three  years after the material is accepted by the initial carrier. For all  other hazardous materials, each shipping paper copy must be retained for  one year after the material is accepted by the initial carrier. Each  shipping paper copy must include the date of acceptance by the initial  carrier. The date on the shipping paper may be the date a shipper  notifies the rail carrier that a shipment is ready for transportation,  as indicated on the waybill or bill of lading, as an alternative to the  date the shipment is picked up, or accepted, by the carrier.
