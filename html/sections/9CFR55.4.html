                            <p class="depth0">After cervids are destroyed in accordance with this part, all  premises, including barns, stockyards and pens, all cars and other  conveyances, and all other materials on any premises or conveyances used  to house or transport such cervids must be cleaned and disinfected under  the supervision of an APHIS employee or a State representative, using  methods specified by the APHIS employee or a State representative.  Premises may not be restocked with cervids until after the date  specified in the herd plan required by Sec. 55.7(b) of this part. The  owner to whom the indemnity is paid will be responsible for expenses  incurred in connection with the cleaning and disinfection, except that  APHIS or a State will pay for cleaning and disinfection of the  conveyances used to transport the cervids to the location of disposal.  However, APHIS may also decide to pay the cost of cleaning and  disinfecting premises when the procedures needed to conduct effective  cleaning and disinfection are unusually extensive and require methods  that are not normally available on a premises. For example, normal  procedures would include washing surfaces with high-pressure hoses and  disinfectants and burying or burning contaminated materials. Unusually  extensive procedures would include disposing of contaminated materials  by digestive disposal or high-temperature incineration.</p>
