                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for DOL revocation. The CO, in consultation with the  Administrator, OFLC, may revoke a temporary agricultural labor  certification approved under this subpart, if, after notice and  opportunity for a hearing (or failure to file rebuttal evidence), it is  found that any of the following violations were committed with respect  to that temporary agricultural labor certification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CO finds that issuance of the temporary agricultural labor  certification was not justified due to a willful misrepresentation on  the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CO finds that the employer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Willfully violated a material term or condition of the approved  temporary agricultural labor certification or the H-2A regulations,  unless otherwise provided under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) through (iv) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failed, after notification, to cure a substantial violation of  the applicable housing standards set out in 20 CFR 655.104(d); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Significantly failed to cooperate with a DOL investigation or  with a DOL official performing an investigation, inspection, or law  enforcement function under sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188, this  subpart, or 29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual  obligations); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed  by the ESA for violation(s) of obligations found by that agency, or with  one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court order  secured by the Secretary under sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188,  this subpart, or 29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual  obligations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The CO determines after a recommendation is made by the WHD ESA  in accordance with 29 CFR 501.20, which governs when a recommendation of  revocation may be made to ETA, that the conduct complained of upon  examination meets the standards of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a court or the DHS, or, as a result of an audit, the CO,  determines that there was fraud or willful misrepresentation involving  the Application for Temporary Employment Certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DOL procedures for revocation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CO will send to the  employer (and his attorney or agent) a Notice of Intent to Revoke by  means normally ensuring next-day delivery, which will contain a detailed  statement of the grounds for the proposed revocation and the time   period allowed for the employer's rebuttal. The employer may submit  evidence in rebuttal within 14 calendar days of the date the notice is  issued. The CO must consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding  whether to revoke the temporary agricultural labor certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If rebuttal evidence is not timely filed by the employer, the  Notice of Intent to Revoke will become the final decision of the  Secretary and take effect immediately at the end of the 14-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, after reviewing the employer's timely filed rebuttal  evidence, the CO finds that the employer more likely than not meets one  or more of the bases for revocation under Sec. 655.117(a), the CO will  notify the employer, by means normally ensuring next-day delivery,  within 14 calendar days after receiving such timely filed rebuttal  evidence, of his/her final determination that the temporary agricultural  labor certification should be revoked. The CO's notice will contain a  detailed statement of the bases for the decision, and must offer the  employer an opportunity to request a hearing. The notice must state  that, to obtain such a hearing, the employer must, within 10 calendar  days of the date of the notice file a written request to the Chief  Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, 800 K  Street, NW., Suite 400-N, Washington, DC 20001-8002, and simultaneously  serve a copy to the Administrator, OFLC. The timely filing of a request  for a hearing will stay the revocation pending the outcome of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 5 business days of receipt of the request  for a hearing, the CO will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to  the Chief Administrative Law Judge by means normally assuring next-day  delivery. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will immediately assign an  ALJ to conduct the hearing. The procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to  such hearings, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request for a hearing will not be considered to be a  complaint to which an answer is required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ALJ will ensure that the hearing is scheduled to take place  within 15 calendar days after the ALJ's receipt of the ETA case file, if  the employer so requests, and will allow for the introduction of new  evidence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ALJ's decision must be rendered within 20 calendar days  after the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or  modify the CO's determination. The ALJ's decision must be provided  immediately to the employer, CO, Administrator, OFLC, DHS, and DOS by  means normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the  final decision of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employer's obligations in the event of revocation. If an  employer's temporary agricultural labor certification is revoked under  this section, and the workers have departed the place of recruitment,  the employer will be responsible for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment to the worker of the amount due under the three-fourths  guarantee as required by Sec. 655.104(i); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other wages, benefits, and working conditions due or owing  to the worker under these regulations.</p>
