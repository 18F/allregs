                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The enclosure for each motor controller or motor-control center must meet either NEMA ICS 2 and NEMA ICS 2.3, or Table 5 of IEC 60092-201 (all three standards incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), as appropriate, for the location where it is installed. In addition, each such enclosure in a hazardous location must meet subpart 111.105 of this part. NEMA ICS 2.4 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1) provides guidance on the differences between devices meeting NEMA and those meeting IEC for motor service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Low-voltage release. Each motor controller for a fire pump, elevator, steering gear, or auxiliary that is vital to the vessel's propulsion system, except a motor controller for a vital propulsion auxiliary which can be restarted from a central control station, must have low-voltage release if automatic restart after a voltage failure or its resumption to operation is not hazardous. If automatic restart is hazardous, the motor controller must have low-voltage protection. Motor controllers for other motors must not have low-voltage release unless the starting

current and the short-time sustained current of the additional low-voltage release load is within the capacity of one ship's service generator. Automatic sequential starting of low-voltage release controllers is acceptable to meet this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Low-voltage protection. Each motor controller must have low-voltage protection, except for the following motor controllers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A motor controller that has low-voltage release under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A motor controller for a motor of less than 2 horsepower (1.5 kW).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identification of controllers. (1) Each motor controller and motor control center must be marked externally with the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each motor controller and motor control center must be marked externally with the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturer's name or identification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Voltage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number of phases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Current.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> kW (Horsepower).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Identification of motor being controlled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Current rating of trip setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each controller must be provided with heat durable and permanent elementary wiring/schematic diagrams of the controller located on the door interior.
