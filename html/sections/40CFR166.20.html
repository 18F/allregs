The application shall identify all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sites to be treated, including their locations within the State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The method of application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rate of application in terms of active ingredient and product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The maximum number of applications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The total acreage or other appropriate unit proposed to be treated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The total amount of pesticide proposed to be used in terms of both active ingredient and product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> All applicable restrictions and requirements concerning the proposed use which may not appear on labeling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The duration of the proposed use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Earliest possible harvest dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Alternative methods of control. The application shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A detailed explanation of why the pesticide(s) currently registered for the particular use proposed in the application is not available in adequate supplies and/or effective to the degree needed to control the emergency. If the applicant states that an available registered pesticide is ineffective for the given situation, the statement must be supported by field data which demonstrate ineffectiveness of registered pesticides, or, if such data are unavailable, statements by qualified agricultural experts, extension personnel, university personnel or other persons similarly qualified in the field of pest control; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed explanation of why alternative practices, if available, either would not provide adequate control or would not be economically or environmentally feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effectiveness of proposed use. The application shall contain data, a discussion of field trials, or other evidence which provide the basis for the conclusion that the proposed pesticide treatment will be effective in dealing with the emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Discussion of residues for food uses. If the proposed use is expected to result in residues of the pesticide in or on food, the application shall list the food likely to contain such residues and shall contain an estimate of the maximum amount of the residue likely to result from the proposed use, together with the information on which such estimates are based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Discussion of risk information. The application shall address the potential risks to human health, endangered or threatened species, beneficial organisms, and the environment expected to result from the proposed use, together with references to data and other supporting information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Coordination with other affected State or Federal agencies.
