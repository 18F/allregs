                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of the Guidelines. (1) The guidelines in this section are the basis for determining what unclassified information regarding the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody, in a given technical or programmatic subject area are to be designated as DoD UCNI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The guidelines in this section are the basis for determining what unclassified information regarding the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody, in a given technical or programmatic subject area are to be designated as DoD UCNI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decision to protect unclassified information as DoD UCNI shall be based on a determination that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General Guidance. (1) Unclassified information relating to the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody is to be protected from public disclosure to prevent the adverse effects identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Public availability of information that would not result in such adverse effects is not to be restricted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unclassified information relating to the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody is to be protected from public disclosure to prevent the adverse effects identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Public availability of information that would not result in such adverse effects is not to be restricted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In controlling DoD SNM information, only the minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security shall be applied to prohibit the disclosure and dissemination of DoD UCNI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any information that has been, or is, widely and irretrievably disseminated in the public domain and whose dissemination was not, or is not, under Government control is exempt from control under these guidelines. However, the fact that information is in the public domain is not a sufficient basis for determining that similar or updated Government-owned and -controlled information in another document or other material is not, or is no longer, DoD UCNI; case-by-case determinations are required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Topical Guidance. DoD Components shall consider the topics discussed in this section during the preparation of unclassified information that addresses the physical protection of DoD SNM or nuclear weapons in DoD custody to determine if it qualifies for control as DoD UCNI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vulnerability Assessments. (i) General vulnerabilities that could be associated with specific DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facility locations, or DoD nuclear weapons storage facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General vulnerabilities that could be associated with specific DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facility locations, or DoD nuclear weapons storage facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fact that DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility security-related projects or upgrades are planned or in progress, if not observable from a public area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identification and description of security system components intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident or act of sabotage at a DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Material Control and Accountability.
