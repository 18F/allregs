                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Liability assumed or taken subject to by partnership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.707-3 and 1.707- 4, if a partnership assumes or takes property subject to a qualified  liability (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section) of a partner,  the partnership is treated as transferring consideration to the partner  only to the   extent provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. By contrast, if the  partnership assumes or takes property subject to a liability of the  partner other than a qualified liability, the partnership is treated as  transferring consideration to the partner to the extent that the amount  of the liability exceeds the partner's share of that liability  immediately after the partnership assumes or takes subject to the  liability as provided in paragraphs (a) (2), (3) and (4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partner's share of liability. A partner's share of any liability  of the partnership is determined under the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Recourse liability. A partner's share of a recourse liability of  the partnership equals the partner's share of the liability under the  rules of section 752 and the regulations thereunder. A partnership  liability is a recourse liability to the extent that the obligation is a  recourse liability under Sec. 1.752-1(a)(1) or would be treated as a  recourse liability under that section if it were treated as a  partnership liability for purposes of that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonrecourse liability. A partner's share of a nonrecourse  liability of the partnership is determined by applying the same  percentage used to determine the partner's share of the excess  nonrecourse liability under Sec. 1.752-3(a)(3). A partnership liability  is a nonrecourse liability of the partnership to the extent that the  obligation is a nonrecourse liability under Sec. 1.752-1(a)(2) or would  be a nonrecourse liability of the partnership under Sec. 1.752-1(a)(2)  if it were treated as a partnership liability for purposes of that  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduction of partner's share of liability. For purposes of this  section, a partner's share of a liability, immediately after a  partnership assumes or takes subject to the liability, is determined by  taking into account a subsequent reduction in the partner's share if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time that the partnership assumes or takes subject to a  liability, it is anticipated that the transferring partner's share of  the liability will be subsequently reduced; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reduction of the partner's share of the liability is part  of a plan that has as one of its principal purposes minimizing the  extent to which the assumption of or taking subject to the liability is  treated as part of a sale under Sec. 1.707-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> does not apply  to any liability assumed or taken subject to by the partnership with a  principal purpose of reducing the extent to which any other liability  assumed or taken subject to by the partnership is treated as a transfer  of consideration under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rule applicable to qualified liabilities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a  transfer of property by a partner to a partnership is not otherwise  treated as part of a sale, the partnership's assumption of or taking  subject to a qualified liability in connection with a transfer of  property is not treated as part of a sale. If a transfer of property by  a partner to the partnership is treated as part of a sale without regard  to the partnership's assumption of or taking subject to a qualified  liability (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section) in connection  with the transfer of property, the partnership's assumption of or taking  subject to that liability is treated as a transfer of consideration made  pursuant to a sale of such property to the partnership only to the  extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of consideration that the partnership would be  treated as transferring to the partner under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section if the liability were not a qualified liability; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount obtained by multiplying the amount of the qualified  liability by the partner's net equity percentage with respect to that  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A partner's net equity percentage with respect to an item of  property equals the percentage determined by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The aggregate transfers of money or other consideration to the  partner by the partnership (other than any transfer described in this  paragraph (a)(5)) that are treated as proceeds realized from the sale of  the transferred property; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The excess of the fair market value of the property at the time  it is transferred to the partnership over any qualified liability  encumbering the property or, in the case of any qualified liability  described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) (C) or (D) of this section, that is  properly allocable to the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Qualified liability of a partner defined. A liability assumed or  taken subject to by a partnership in connection with a transfer of  property to the partnership by a partner is qualified liability of the  partner only to the extend--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The liability is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A liability that was incurred by the partner more than two years  prior to the earlier of the date the partner agrees in writing to  transfers the property or the date the partner transfers the property to  the partnership and that has encumbered the transferred property  throughout that two-year period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A liability that was not incurred in anticipation of the  transfer of the property to a partnership, buy that was incurred by the  partner within the two-year period prior to the earlier of the date the  partner agrees in writing to transfer the property or the date the  partner transfers the property to the partnership and that has  encumbered the transferred property since it was incurred (see paragraph  (a)(7) of this section for further rules regarding a liability incurred  within two years of a property transfer or of a written agreement to  transfer);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A liability that is allocable under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T  to capital expenditures with respect to the property; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A liability that was incurred in the ordinary course of the  trade or business in which property transferred to the partnership was  used or held but only if all the assets related to that trade or  business are transferred other than assets that are not material to a  continuation of the trade or business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the liability is a recourse liability, the amount of the  liability does not exceed the fair market value of the transferred  property (less the amount of any other liabilities that are senior in  priority and that either encumber such property or are liabilities  described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) (C) or (D) of this section) at the time  of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Liability incurred within two years of transfer presumed to be  in anticipation of the transfer--(i) In general. For purposes of this  section, if within a two-year period a partner incurs a liability (other  than a liability described in paragraph (a)(6)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> (C) or (D) of this  section) and transfers property to a partnership or agrees in writing to  transfer the property, and in connection with the transfer the  partnership assumes or takes the property subject to the liability, the  liability is presumed to be incurred in anticipation of the transfer  unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the liability  was not incurred in anticipation of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of transfers of property subject to liabilities  incurred within two years of the transfer. If a partner treats a  liability assumed or taken subject to by a partnership as a qualified  liability under paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B) of this section, such treatment  is to be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with  Sec. 1.707-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of debt-financed transfers of consideration by  partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of Sec. 1.707-3, if a  partner transfers property to a partnership, and the partnership incurs  a liability and all or a portion of the proceeds of that liability are  allocable under Sec. 1.163-8T to a transfer of money or other  consideration to the partner made within 90 days of incurring the  liability, the transfer of money or other consideration to the partner  is taken into account only to the extent that the amount of money or the  fair market value of the other consideration transferred exceeds that  partner's allocable share of the partnership liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partner's allocable share of liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  partner's allocable   share of a partnership liability for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of  this section equals the amount obtained by multiplying the partner's  share of the liability as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  by the fraction determined by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The portion of the liability that is allocable under Sec.  1.163-8T to the money or other property transferred to the partner; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of the liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Debt-financed transfers made pursuant to a plan--(A) In  general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, if  a partnership transfers to more than one partner pursuant to a plan all  or a portion of the proceeds of one or more partnership liabilities,  paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied by treating all of the  liabilities incurred pursuant to the plan as one liability, and each  partner's allocable share of those liabilities equals the amount  obtained by multiplying the sum of the partner's shares of each of the  respective liabilities (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section)  by the fraction obtained by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The portion of those liabilities that is allocable under Sec.  1.163-8T to the money or other consideration transferred to the partners  pursuant to the plan; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total amount of those liabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not  apply to any transfer of money or other property to a partner that is  made with a principal purpose of reducing the extent to which any  transfer is taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reduction of partner's share of liability. For purposes of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a partner's share of a liability,  immediately after the partnership assumes or takes subject to the  liability, is determined by taking into account a subsequent reduction  in the partner's share if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is anticipated that the partner's share of the liability that  is allocable to a transfer of money or other consideration to the  partner will be reduced subsequent to the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The reduction of the partner's share of the liability is part of  a plan that has as one of its principal purposes minimizing the extent  to which the partnership's distribution of the proceeds of the borrowing  is treated as part of a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Refinancings. To the extent that the proceeds of a partner or  partnership liability (the refinancing debt) are allocable under the  rules of Sec. 1.163-8T to payments discharging all or part of any other  liability of that partner or of the partnership, as the case may be, the  refinancing debt is treated as the other liability for purposes of  applying the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Share of liability where assumption accompanied by transfer of  money. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.707-3 through 1.707-5, if pursuant  to a plan a partner pays or contributes money to the partnership and the  partnership assumes or takes subject to one or more liabilities (other  than qualified liabilities) of the partner, the amount of those  liabilities that the partnership is treated as assuming or taking  subject to is reduced (but not below zero) by the money transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tiered partnerships and other related persons. If a lower-tier  partnership succeeds to a liability of an upper-tier partnership, the  liability in the lower-tier partnership retains the characterization as  qualified or nonqualified that it had under these rules in the upper- tier partnership. A similar rule applies to other related party  transactions involving liabilities to the extent provided by guidance  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A and B form partnership AB, which  will engage in renting office space. A transfers $500,000 in cash to the  partnership, and B transfers an office building to the partnership. At  the time it is transferred to the partnership, the office building has a  fair market value of $1,000,000, an adjusted basis of $400,000, and is  encumbered by a $500,000 liability, which B incurred 12 months earlier  to finance the acquisition of other property. No facts rebut the  presumption that the liability was incurred in anticipation of the  transfer of the property to the partnership. Assume that this liability  is a nonrecourse   liability of the partnership within the meaning of section 752 and the  regulations thereunder. The partnership agreement provides that  partnership items will be allocated equally between A and B, including  excess nonrecourse deductions under Sec. 1.752-3(a)(3). The partnership  agreement complies with the requirements of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nonrecourse liability secured by the office building is not  a qualified liability within the meaning of paragraph (a)(6) of this  section. B would be allocated 50 percent of the excess nonrecourse  liability under the partnership agreement. Accordingly, immediately  after the partnership's assumption of that liability, B's share of the  liability equals $250,000, which is equal to B's 50 percent share of the  excess nonrecourse liability of the partnership as determined in  accordance with B's share of partnership profits under Sec. 1.752- 3(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The partnership's taking subject to the liability encumbering  the office building is treated as a transfer of $250,000 of  consideration to B (the amount by which the liability ($500,000) exceeds  B's share of that liability immediately after taking subject to  $250,000)). B is treated as having sold $250,000 of the fair market  value of the office building to the partnership in exchange for the  partnership's taking subject to a $250,000 liability. This results in a  gain of $150,000 ($250,000 minus ($250,000/$1,000,000 multiplied by  $400,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C transfers property Y to a  partnership. At the time of its transfer to the partnership, property Y  has a fair market value of $10,000,000 and is subject to an $8,000,000  liability that C incurred, immediately before transferring property Y to  the partnership, in order to finance other expenditures. Upon the  transfer of property Y to the partnership, the partnership assumed the  liability encumbering that property. The partnership assumed this  liability solely to acquire property Y. Under section 752 and the  regulations thereunder, immediately after the partnership's assumption  of the liability encumbering property Y, the liability is a recourse  liability of the partnership and C's share of that liability is  $7,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the facts of this example, the liability encumbering  property Y is not a qualified liability. Accordingly, the partnership's  assumption of the liability results in a transfer of consideration to C  in connection with C's transfer of property Y to the partnership in the  amount of $1,000,000 (the excess of the liability assumed by the  partnership ($8,000,000) over C's share of the liability immediately  after the assumption ($7,000,000)). See paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2. In addition,  property Y is a fully leased office building, the rental income from  property Y is sufficient to meet debt service, and the remaining term of  the liability is ten years. It is anticipated that, three years after  the partnership's assumption of the liability, C's share of the  liability under section 752 will be reduced to zero because of a shift  in the allocation of partnership losses pursuant to the terms of the  partnership agreement. Under the partnership agreement, this shift in  the allocation of partnership losses is dependent solely on the passage  of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the reduction in C's  share of the liability was anticipated at the time of C's transfer, and  the reduction was part of a plan that has as one of its principal  purposes minimizing the extent of sale treatment under Sec. 1.707-3  (i.e., a principal purpose of allocating a large percentage of losses to  C in the first three years when losses were not likely to be realized  was to minimize the extent to which C's transfer would be treated as  part of a sale), C's share of the liability immediately after the  assumption is treated as equal to C's reduced share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D and E form  partnership DE which will engage in a consulting business that requires  no overhead and minimal cash on hand for daily operating expenses.  Previously, D and E, as individual sole proprietors, operated separate  consulting businesses. D and E each transfer to the partnership  sufficient cash to cover daily operating expenses together with the  goodwill and trade payables related to each sole proprietorship. Due to  uncertainty over the collection rate on the trade receivables related to  their sole proprietorships, D and E agree that none of the trade  receivables will be transferred to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the facts of this example, all the assets related to the  consulting business (other than the trade receivables) together with the  trade payables were transferred to partnership DE. The trade receivables  retained by D and E are not material to a continuation of the trade or  business by the partnership because D and E contributed sufficient cash  to cover daily operating expenses. Accordingly, the trade payables  transferred to the partnership constitute qualified liability under  paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F transfers property Z to a partnership. At the time  of its transfer to the partnership, property Z has a fair market value  of $165,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $75,000. Also, at the time of  the transfer, property Z is subject to a $75,000 liability that F  incurred more than two years before transferring property Z to   the partnership. The liability has been secured by property Z since it  was incurred by F. Upon the transfer of property Z to the partnership,  the partnership assumed the liability encumbering that property. The  partnership made no other transfers to F in consideration for the  transfer of property Z to the partnership. Assume that, under section  752 and the regulations thereunder, immediately after the partnership's  assumption of the liability encumbering property Z, the liability is a  recourse liability of the partnership and F's share of that liability is  $25,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $75,000 liability secured by property Z is a qualified  liability of F because F incurred the liability more than two years  prior to the assumption of the liability by the partnership and the  liability has encumbered property Z for more than two years prior to  that assumption. See paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Therefore, since  no other transfer to F was made as consideration for the transfer of  property Z, under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the partnership's  assumption of the qualified liability of F encumbering property Z is not  treated as part of a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in  Example 5, except that the partnership makes a transfer to D of $30,000  in money that is consideration for F's transfer of property Z to the  partnership under Sec. 1.707-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 5, the $75,000 liability secured by property Z is  a qualified liability of F. Since the partnership transferred $30,000 to  F in addition to assuming the qualified liability under paragraph (a)(5)  of this section, the partnership's assumption of this qualified  liability is treated as a transfer of additional consideration to F to  the extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount that the partnership would be treated as transferring  to F if the liability were not a qualified liability ($50,000 (i.e., the  excess of the $75,000 qualified liability over F's $25,000 share of that  liability)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount obtained by multiplying the qualified liability  ($75,000) by F's net equity percentage with respect to property Z (one- third).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> F's net equity percentage with respect to property Z equals  the fraction determined by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The aggregate amount of money or other consideration (other than  the qualified liability) transferred to F and treated as part of a sale  of property Z under Sec. 1.707-3(a) ($30,000 transfer of money); by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> F's net equity in property Z ($90,000 (i.e., the excess of the  $165,000 fair market value over the $75,000 qualified liability)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Accordingly, the partnership's assumption of the qualified  liability of F encumbering property Z is treated as a transfer of  $25,000 (one-third of $75,000) of consideration to F pursuant to a sale.  Therefore, F is treated as having sold $55,000 of the fair market value  of property Z to the partnership in exchange for $30,000 in money and  the partnership's assumption of $25,000 of the qualified liability.  Accordingly, F must recognize $30,000 of gain on the sale (the excess of  the $55,000 amount realized over $25,000 of F's adjusted basis for  property, Z (i.e., one-third of F's adjusted basis for the property,  because F is treated as having sold one-third of the property to the  partnership)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> (which determines a partner's share of a recourse  liability).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> G and H transferred properties 1 and 2 to the partnership  pursuant to a plan. Accordingly, the partnership's taking subject to  liability 1 is treated as a transfer of only $500 of consideration to G,  (the amount by which liability 1 ($6,000) exceeds G's share of  liabilities 1 and 2 ($5,500)), and the partnership's assumption of  liability 2 is treated as a transfer of only $5,000 of consideration to  H (the amount by which liability 2 ($7,000) exceeds H's share of  liabilities 1 and 2 ($2,000)). G is treated under the rule in Sec.  1.707-3 as having sold $500 of the fair market value of property 1 in  exchange for the partnership's taking subject to liability 1 and H is  treated as having sold $5,000 of the fair market value of property 2 in  exchange for the assumption of liability 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 7, except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> H transferred the proceeds of liability 2 to the partnership;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> H incurred liability 2 in an attempt to reduce the extent to  which the partnership's taking subject to liability 1 would be treated  as a transfer of consideration to G (and thereby reduce the portion of  G's transfer of property 1 to the partnership that would be treated as  part of a sale).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the partnership assumed liability 2 with a principal  purpose of reducing the extent to which the partnership's taking subject  to liability 1 would be treated as a transfer of consideration to G,  liability 2 is ignored in applying paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  Accordingly, the partnership's taking subject to liability 1 is treated  as a transfer of $4,000 of consideration to G (the amount by which  liability 1 ($6,000) exceeds G's share of liability 1 ($2,000)). On the  other hand, the partnership's assumption of liability 2 is not treated  as a transfer of any consideration to H because H's share of that  liability equals $7,000 as a result of H's transfer of $7,000 in money  to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to a plan, I transfers property 1 and  J transfers property 2 plus $10,000 in cash to partnership IJ in  exchange for equal interests in the partnership. At the time the  properties are transferred to the partnership, property 1 has a fair  market value of $100,000, an adjusted tax basis of $5,000, and is  encumbered by a qualified liability of $50,000 (liability 1). Property 2  has a fair market value of $100,000, an adjusted tax basis of $5,000,  and is encumbered by a qualified liability of $70,000 (liability 2).  Pursuant to the plan, the partnership transferred to I $10,000 in cash.  That amount is consideration for I's transfer of property 1 to the  partnership under Sec. 1.707-3. In accordance with Sec. 1.707-5(a)(2),  I and J are each allocated $25,000 of liability 1 and $35,000 of  liability 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the partnership transferred $10,000 to I as  consideration for the transfer of property, under Sec. 1.707-5(a)(5),  the partnership's assumption of liability 1 is treated as a transfer of  additional consideration to I, even though liability 1 is a qualified  liability, to the extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount that the partnership would be treated as transferring  to I if the liability were not a qualified liability; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount obtained by multiplying the qualified liability by  I's net equity percentage with respect to property 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because I and J transferred properties 1 and 2 to the  partnership pursuant to a plan, treating I's qualified liability as a  nonqualified liability under Sec. 1.707-5(a)(5)(i)(A) enables I to  apply the special rule applicable to transfers of encumbered property to  a partnership by more than one partner pursuant to a plan under Sec.  1.707-5(a)(4). Under this alternative test, the partnership's assumption  of liability 1 encumbering property 1 is treated as a transfer of zero  ($0) additional consideration to I pursuant to a sale. This is because  the amount of liability 1 ($50,000) does not exceed the sum of I's share  of liability 1 treated as a nonqualified liability ($25,000) and I's  share of liability 2 ($35,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The alternative under Sec. 1.707-5(a)(5)(i)(B) is the amount  obtained by multiplying the qualified liability ($50,000) by I's net  equity percentage with respect to property 1. I's net equity percentage  with respect to property 1 equals one-fifth, the fraction determined by  dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The aggregate amount of money or other consideration (other than  the qualified liability) transferred to I and treated as part of a sale  of property 1 under Sec. 1.707-3(a) (the $10,000 transfer of money; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> I's net equity in property 1 ($50,000 i.e., the excess of the  $100,000 fair market value over the $50,000 qualified liability).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under this alternative test, the partnership's assumption of the  qualified liability encumbering property 1 is treated as a transfer of  $10,000 (one-fifth of the $50,000 qualified liability) of additional  consideration to I pursuant to a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Applying Sec. 1.707-5(a)(5) to these facts, the partnership's  assumption of liability 1 is treated as a transfer of additional  consideration to I to the extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> zero; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Therefore, the partnership's assumption of I's qualified  liability encumbering property 1 is not treated as a transfer of any  additional consideration to I pursuant to a sale, and I is treated as  having only received $10,000 of the fair market value of property 1 to  the partnership in exchange for $10,000 in cash. Accordingly, I must  recognize $9,500 of gain on the sale, that is, the excess of the $10,000  amount realized over $500 of I's adjusted tax basis for property 1 (one- tenth of I's adjusted tax basis for the property, because I is treated  as having sold one-tenth of the property to the partnership). Since no  other transfer to J was made as consideration for the transfer of  property 2, the partnership's assumption of the qualified liability of J  encumbering property 2 is not treated as part of a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K transfers property Z to partnership KL in exchange  for an interest therein on April 9, 1992. On September 13, 1992, the  partnership incurs a liability of $20,000. On November 17, 1992, the  partnership transfers $20,000 to K, and $10,000 of this transfer is  allocable under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T to proceeds of the  partnership liability incurred on September 13, 1992. The remaining  $10,000 is paid from other partnership funds. Assume that, under section  752 and the corresponding regulations,   the $20,000 liability incurred on September 13, 1992, is a recourse  liability of the partnership and K's share of that liability is $10,000  on November 17, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because a portion of the transfer made to K on November 17,  1992, is allocable under Sec. 1.163-8T to proceeds of a partnership  liability that was incurred by the partnership within 90 days of that  transfer, K is required to take the transfer into account in applying  the rules of this section and Sec. 1.707-3 only to the extent that the  amount of the transfer exceeds K's allocable share of the liability used  to fund the transfer. K's allocable share of the $20,000 liability used  to fund $10,000 of the transfer to K is $5,000 (K's share of the  liability ($10,000) multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the liability that is allocable to the  distribution to K ($10,000); by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of such liability ($20,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Therefore, K is required to take into account only $15,000 of  the $20,000 partnership transfer to K for purposes of this section and  Sec. 1.707-3. Under these facts, assuming the within-two-year  presumption is not rebutted, this $15,000 transfer will be treated under  the rule in Sec. 1.707-3 as part of a sale by K of property Z to the  partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> M generates  receivables which have an adjusted basis of zero in the ordinary course  of its business. For M to use receivables as security for a loan, a  commercial lender requires M to transfer the receivables to a  partnership in which M has a 90 percent interest. In January, 1992, M  transfers to the partnership receivables with a face value of $100,000.  N (who is not related to M) transfers $10,000 cash to the partnership in  exchange for a 10 percent interest. The partnership borrows $80,000,  secured by the receivables, and makes a distribution of $72,000 of the  proceeds to M and $8,000 of the proceeds to N within 90 days of  incurring the liability. M's share of the liability under Sec. 1.707- 5(a)(2) is $72,000 (90 percentx$80,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>. Therefore, M is  not required to take into account any of the loan proceeds for purposes  of this section and Sec. 1.707-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the receivables are collected, M must be allocated the  gain on the contributed receivables under section 704(c). However, the  lender permits the partnership to distribute cash to the partners only  to the extent of the value of new receivables contributed to the  partnership. In 1993, M contributes additional receivables and receives  a distribution of cash. The taxable income recognized by the partnership  on the receivables is taxable income of the partnership arising in the  ordinary course of the partnership's activities. To the extent the  distribution does not exceed 90 percent (M's percentage interest in  overall partnership profits) of the partnership's operating cash flow  under Sec. 1.707-4(b), the distribution to M is presumed not to be a  part of a sale of receivables by M to the partnership, and the  presumption is not rebutted under these facts.
