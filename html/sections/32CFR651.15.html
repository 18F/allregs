                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Throughout the environmental analysis process, the proponent  will consider mitigation measures to avoid or minimize environmental  harm. Mitigation measures include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Avoiding the impact altogether, by eliminating the action or  parts of the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the  action and its implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rectifying the impact; by repairing, rehabilitating, or  restoring the adverse effect on the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reducing or eliminating the impact over time, by preservation  and maintenance operations during the life of the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compensating for the impact, by replacing or providing  substitute resources or environments. (Examples and further  clarification are presented in appendix C of this part.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the analysis proceeds to an EA or EIS, mitigation measures  will be clearly assessed and those selected for implementation will be  identified in the FNSI or the ROD. The proponent must implement those  identified mitigations, because they are commitments made as part of the  Army decision. The proponent is responsible for responding to inquiries  from the public or other agencies regarding the status of mitigation  measures adopted in the NEPA process. The mitigation shall become a line  item in the proponent's   budget or other funding document, if appropriate, or included in the  legal document implementing the action (for example, contracts, leases,  or grants). Only those practical mitigation measures that can reasonably  be accomplished as part of a proposed alternative will be identified.  Any mitigation measures selected by the proponent will be clearly  outlined in the NEPA decision document, will be budgeted and funded (or  funding arranged) by the proponent, and will be identified, with the  appropriate fund code, in the EPR (AR 200-1). Mitigations will be  monitored through environmental compliance reporting, such as the ISR  (AR 200-1) or the Environmental Quality Report. Mitigation measures are  identified and funded in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,  or other media area requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based upon the analysis and selection of mitigation measures  that reduce environmental impacts until they are no longer significant,  an EA may result in a FNSI. If a proponent uses mitigation measures in  such a manner, the FNSI must identify these mitigating measures, and  they become legally binding and must be accomplished as the project is  implemented. If any of these identified mitigation measures do not  occur, so that significant adverse environmental effects could  reasonably expected to result, the proponent must publish an NOI and  prepare an EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Potential mitigation measures that appear practical, and are  unobtainable within expected Army resources, or that some other agency  (including non-Army agencies) should perform, will be identified in the  NEPA analysis to the maximum extent practicable. A number of factors  determine what is practical, including military mission, manpower  restrictions, cost, institutional barriers, technical feasibility, and  public acceptance. Practicality does not necessarily ensure resolution  of conflicts among these items, rather it is the degree of conflict that  determines practicality. Although mission conflicts are inevitable, they  are not necessarily insurmountable; and the proponent should be cautious  about declaring all mitigations impractical and carefully consider any  manpower requirements. The key point concerning both the manpower and  cost constraints is that, unless money is actually budgeted and manpower  assigned, the mitigation does not exist. Coordination by the proponent  early in the process will be required to allow ample time to get the  mitigation activities into the budget cycle. The project cannot be  undertaken until all required mitigation efforts are fully resourced, or  until the lack of funding and resultant effects, are fully addressed in  the NEPA analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mitigation measures that were considered but rejected, including  those that can be accomplished by other agencies, must be discussed,  along with the reason for the rejection, within the EA or EIS. If they  occur in an EA, their rejection may lead to an EIS, if the resultant  unmitigated impacts are significant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proponents may request assistance with mitigation from  cooperating non-Army agencies, when appropriate. Such assistance is  appropriate when the requested agency was a cooperating agency during  preparation of a NEPA document, or has the technology, expertise, time,  funds, or familiarity with the project or the local ecology necessary to  implement the mitigation measure more effectively than the lead agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The proponent agency or other appropriate cooperating agency  will implement mitigations and other conditions established in the EA or  EIS, or commitments made in the FNSI or ROD. Legal documents  implementing the action (such as contracts, permits, grants) will  specify mitigation measures to be performed. Penalties against a  contractor for noncompliance may also be specified as appropriate.  Specification of penalties should be fully coordinated with the  appropriate legal advisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A monitoring and enforcement program for any mitigation will be  adopted and summarized in the NEPA documentation (see appendix C of this  part for guidelines on implementing such a program). Whether adoption of  a monitoring and enforcement program is applicable (40 CFR 1505.2(c))  and   whether the specific adopted action requires monitoring (40 CFR 1505.3)  may depend on the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A change in environmental conditions or project activities  assumed in the EIS (such that original predictions of the extent of  adverse environmental impacts may be too limited);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain (for example,  new technology);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Major environmental controversy remains associated with the  selected alternative; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure of a mitigation measure, or other unforeseen  circumstances, could result in a failure to meet achievement of  requirements (such as adverse effects on federal or state listed  endangered or threatened species, important historic or archaeological  sites that are either listed or eligible for nomination to the National  Register of Historic Places, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers,  or other public or private protected resources). Proponents must follow  local installation environmental office procedures to coordinate with  appropriate federal, tribal, state, or local agencies responsible for a  particular program to determine what would constitute ``adverse  effects.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring is an integral part of any mitigation system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enforcement monitoring ensures that mitigation is being  performed as described in the NEPA documentation, mitigation  requirements and penalty clauses are written into any contracts, and  required provisions are enforced. The development of an enforcement  monitoring program is governed by who will actually perform the  mitigation: a contractor, a cooperating agency, or an in-house (Army)  lead agency. Detailed guidance is contained in Appendix C of this part.  The proponent is ultimately responsible for performing any mitigation  activities. All monitoring results will be sent to the installation  Environmental Office; in the case of the Army Reserves, the Regional  Support Commands (RSCs); and, in the case of the National Guard, the  NGB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effectiveness monitoring measures the success of the mitigation  effort and/or the environmental effect. While quantitative measurements  are desired, qualitative measures may be required. The objective is to  obtain enough information to judge the effect of the mitigation. In  establishing the monitoring system, the responsible agent should  coordinate the monitoring with the Environmental Office. Specific steps  and guidelines are included in appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The monitoring program, in most cases, should be established  well before the action begins, particularly when biological variables  are being measured and investigated. At this stage, any necessary  contracts, funding, and manpower assignments must be initiated.  Technical results from the analysis should be summarized by the  proponent and coordinated with the installation Environmental Office.  Subsequent coordination with the concerned public and other agencies, as  arranged through development of the mitigation plan, will be handled  through the Environmental Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If the mitigations are effective, the monitoring should be  continued as long as the mitigations are needed to address impacts of  the initial action. If the mitigations are ineffective, the proponent  and the responsible group should re-examine the mitigation measures, in  consultation with the Environmental Office and appropriate experts, and  resolve the inadequacies of the mitigation or monitoring. Professionals  with specialized and recognized expertise in the topic or issue, as well  as concerned citizens, are essential to the credibility of this review.  If a different program is required, then a new system must be  established. If ineffective mitigations are identified which were  required to reduce impact below significance levels (Sec. 651.35 (g)),  the proponent may be required to publish an NOI and prepare an EIS  (paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Environmental monitoring report. An environmental monitoring  report is prepared at one or more points after program or action  execution. Its purpose is to determine the accuracy of impact  predictions. It can serve as the basis for adjustments in mitigation  programs and to adjust impact predictions in future projects. Further   guidance and clarification are included in appendix C of this part.</p>
