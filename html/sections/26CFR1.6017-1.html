(1) Every individual, other than a nonresident alien, having net earnings from self-employment, as defined in section 1402, of $400 or more for the taxable year shall make a return of such earnings. For purposes of this section, an individual who is a resident of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, or (for any taxable year beginning after 1960) Guam or American Samoa is not to be considered a nonresident alien individual. See paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1402(b)-1. A return is required under this section if an individual has self-employment income, as defined in section 1402(b), even though he may not be required to make a return under section 6012 for purposes of the tax imposed by section 1 or 3.

The requirement of section 6013(d)(3) that in the case of a joint return the tax is computed on the aggregate income of the spouses is not applicable with respect to the tax on self-employment income. Where the husband and wife each has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more, it will be necessary for each to complete separate schedules of the computation of self-employment tax with respect to the net earnings of each spouse, despite the fact that a joint return is filed.

However, the failure to apply for or receive a social security account number will not excuse the individual from the requirement that he file such return on or before the due date thereof. Form SS-5 may be obtained from any district office of the Social Security Administration or from any district director. The application shall be filed with a district office of the Social Security Administration or, in the case of an individual not in the United States, with the district office of the Social Security Administration at Baltimore, Md.

Thus, individuals upon whom self-employment tax is imposed by section 1401 must make a declaration of estimated tax if they meet the requirements of section 6015(a); except as otherwise provided under section 6015(i).
