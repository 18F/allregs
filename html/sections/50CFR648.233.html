The Regional Administrator shall  determine the date by which the annual coastwide quota described in  Sec. 648.232 will be harvested and shall close the EEZ to fishing for  spiny dogfish on that date for the remainder of the fishing year by  publishing notification in the Federal Register. Upon the closure date,  and for the remainder of the fishing year, no vessel may fish for or  possess spiny dogfish in the EEZ, nor may vessels issued a spiny dogfish  permit under this part land spiny dogfish, nor may dealers issued a  Federal permit purchase spiny dogfish from vessels issued a spiny  dogfish permit under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated based on a  single-year examination of total catch (including both landings and dead  discards) to determine if the ACL has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Overage repayment. In the event that the ACL has been exceeded  in a given fishing year, the exact amount in pounds by which the ACL was  exceeded shall be deducted, as soon as possible from a subsequent single  fishing year ACL.
