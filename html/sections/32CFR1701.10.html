                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acknowledgement of requests. Upon receipt of a request providing  all necessary information, the D/IMO shall acknowledge receipt to the  requester and provide an assigned request number for further reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tasking to component. Upon receipt of a proper access request,  the D/IMO shall provide a copy of the request to the point of contact  (POC) in the ODNI component with which the records sought reside. The  POC within the component shall determine whether responsive records  exist and, if so, recommend to the D/IMO:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether access should be denied in whole or part (and the legal  basis for denial under the Privacy Act); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether coordination with or referral to another component or  federal agency is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coordination and referrals--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examination of records. If a  component POC receiving a request for access determines that an  originating agency or other agency that has a substantial interest in  the record is best able to process the request (e.g., the record is  governed by another agency's regulation, or another agency originally  generated or classified the record), the POC shall forward to the D/IMO  all records necessary for coordination with or referral to the other  component or agency, as well as specific recommendations with respect to  any denials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of referral. Whenever the D/IMO refers all or any part of  the responsibility for responding to a request   to another agency, the D/IMO shall notify the requester of the referral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect of certain exemptions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In processing a request, the  ODNI shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of  any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or  nonexistence:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> May reveal protected intelligence sources and collection methods  (50 U.S.C. 403-1(i)); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is classified and subject to an exemption appropriately invoked  by ODNI or another agency under subsections (j) or (k) of the Privacy  Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In such event, the ODNI will inform the requester in writing  and advise the requestor of the right to file an administrative appeal  of any adverse determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for response. The D/IMO shall respond to a request for  access promptly upon receipt of recommendations from the POC and  determinations resulting from any necessary coordination with or  referral to another agency. The D/IMO may determine to update a  requester on the status of a request that remains outstanding longer  than reasonably expected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ODNI action on requests for access--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant of access. Once  the D/IMO determines to grant a request for access in whole or in part,  the D/IMO shall notify the requester in writing and come to agreement  with the requester about how to effect access, whether by on-site review  or duplication of the records. If a requester is accompanied by another  person, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any  discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial of access. The D/IMO shall notify the requester in  writing when an adverse determination is made denying a request for  access in any respect. Adverse determinations, or denials, consist of a  determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a  determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be  located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record  subject to the Privacy Act; or a determination that the existence of a  record can neither be confirmed nor denied. The notification letter  shall state:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reason(s) for the denial; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The procedure for appeal of the denial under Sec. 1701.14 of  this subpart.</p>
