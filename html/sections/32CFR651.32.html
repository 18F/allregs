The EA can aid in Army compliance with NEPA when no EIS is necessary. An EA will be prepared if a proposed action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not an emergency (Sec. 651.11(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not exempt from (or an exception to) NEPA (Sec. 651.11(a)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Does not qualify as a CX (Sec. 651.11(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is not adequately covered by existing NEPA analysis and documentation (Sec. 651.19).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Does not normally require an EIS (Sec. 651.42).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An EA can be 1 to 25 pages in length and be adequate to meet the requirements of this part, depending upon site-specific circumstances and conditions. Any analysis that exceeds 25 pages in length should be evaluated to consider whether the action and its effects are significant and thus warrant an EIS.</p>
