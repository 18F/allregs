Appendix A to Subpart KK of Part 63--Data Quality Objective and</p><p class="depth0">Lower Confidence Limit Approaches for Alternative Capture Efficiency</p><p class="depth0">Protocols and Test Methods</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Alternative capture efficiency (CE) protocols and test methods  that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality objective (DQO)  approach or the lower confidence limit (LCL) approach are acceptable  under Sec.  63.827(f). The general criteria for alternative CE protocols  and test methods to qualify under either the DQO or LCL approach are  described in section 2. The DQO approach and criteria specific to the  DQO approach are described in section 3. The LCL approach and criteria  specific to the LCL approach are described in section 4. The recommended  reporting for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in  section 5. The recommended recordkeeping for alternative CE protocols  and test methods are presented in section 6.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Although the Procedures L, G.1, G.2, F.1, and F.2 in Sec.   52.741 of part 52 were developed for TTE and BE testing, the same  procedures can also be used in an alternative CE protocol. For example,  a traditional liquid/gas mass balance CE protocol could employ Procedure  L to measure liquid VOC input and Procedure G.1 to measure captured VOC.</p><p class="depth0">2. General Criteria for DQO and LCL Approaches</p><p class="depth0">2.1 The following general criteria must be met for an alternative  capture efficiency protocol and test methods to qualify under the DQO or  LCL approach.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 An alternative CE protocol must consist of at least three valid  test runs. Each test run must be at least 20 minutes long. No test run  can be longer than 24 hours.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 All test runs must be separate and independent. For example,  liquid VOC input and output must be determined independently for each  run. The final liquid VOC sample from one run cannot be the initial  sample for another run. In addition, liquid input for an entire day  cannot be apportioned among test runs based on production.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Composite liquid samples cannot be used to obtain an ``average  composition'' for a test run. For example, separate initial and final  coating samples must be taken and analyzed for each run; initial and  final samples cannot be combined prior to analysis to derive an  ``average composition'' for the test run.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 All individual test runs that result in a CE of greater than 105  percent are invalid and must be discarded.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 If the source can demonstrate to the regulatory agency that a  test run should not be considered due to an identified testing or  analysis error such as spillage of part of the sample during shipping or  an upset or improper operating conditions that is not considered part of  normal operation then the test result for that individual test run may  be discarded. This limited exception allows sources to discard as  ``outliers'' certain individual test runs without replacing them with a  valid test run as long as the facility has at least three valid test  runs to use when calculating its DQO or LCL. This exception is limited  solely to test runs involving the types of errors identified above.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 All valid test runs that are conducted must be included in the  average CE determination. The individual test run CE results and average  CE results cannot be truncated (i.e., 105 percent cannot be reported as  100+ percent) for purposes of meeting general or specific criteria for  either the DQO or the LCL. If the DQO is satisfied and the average CE is  greater than 100, then 100 percent CE must be considered the result of  the test.</p><p class="depth0">2.8 Alternative test methods for measuring VOC concentration must  include a three-point calibration of the gas analysis instrument in the  expected concentration range.</p><p class="depth0">3. Data Quality Objective Approach</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The purpose of the DQO is to allow sources to use alternative CE  protocols and test methods while ensuring reasonable precision  consistent with pertinent requirements of the Clean Air Act. In addition  to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific DQO  criterion is that the width of the two-sided 95 percent confidence  interval of the mean measured value must be less than or equal to 10  percent of the mean measured value (see Figure 1). This ensures that 95  percent of the time, when the DQO is met, the actual CE value will be  q5 percent of the mean measured value (assuming that the test  protocol is unbiased).

Since all of the general criteria were also satisfied, the  average CE from the nine test runs can be used to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth0">4. Lower Confidence Limit Approach</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The purpose of the LCL approach is to provide sources, that may  be performing much better than their applicable regulatory requirement,  a screening option by which they can demonstrate compliance. The  approach uses less precise methods and avoids additional test runs which  might otherwise be needed to meet the specific DQO criterion while still  being assured of correctly demonstrating compliance. It is designed to  reduce ``false positive'' or so called ``Type II errors'' which may  erroneously indicate compliance where more variable test methods are  employed. Because it encourages CE performance greater than that  required in exchange for reduced compliance demonstration burden, the  sources that successfully use the LCL approach could produce emission  reductions beyond allowable emissions. Thus, it could provide additional  benefits to the environment as well.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The LCL approach compares the 80 percent (two-sided) LCL for the  mean measured CE value to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. In  addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific  LCL criteria are that either the LCL be greater than or equal to the  applicable CE regulatory requirement or that the specific DQO criterion  is met. A more detailed description of the LCL approach follows:</p><p class="depth0">4.3 A source conducts an initial series of at least three runs. The  owner or operator may choose to conduct additional test runs during the  initial test if desired.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 If all of the general criteria are met and the specific DQO  criterion is met, then the average CE value is used to determine  compliance.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 If the data meet all of the general criteria, but do not meet  the specific DQO criterion; and the average CE, using all valid test  runs, is above 100 percent then the test sequence cannot be used to  calculate the LCL. At this point the facility has the option of (a)  conducting more test runs in hopes of meeting the DQO or of bringing the  average CE for all test runs below 100 percent so the LCL can be used or  (b) discarding all previous test data and retesting.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 The purpose of the requirement in Section 4.5 is to protect  against protocols and test methods which may be inherently biased high.  This is important because it is impossible to have an actual CE greater  than 100 percent and the LCL approach only looks at the lower end  variability of the test results. This is different from the DQO which  allows average CE values up to 105 percent because the DQO sets both  upper and lower limits on test variability.</p><p class="depth0">4.7 If at any point during testing the results meet the DQO, the  average CE can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable  regulatory requirement. Similarly, if the average CE is below 100  percent then the LCL can be used for demonstrating compliance with the  applicable regulatory requirement without regard to the DQO.</p><p class="depth0">4.8 The LCL is calculated at an 80 percent (two-sided) confidence  level as follows using Equation 11: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24MY06.006  Where:  LC1 = LCL at an 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level. n = Number of valid test runs. s = Sample standard deviation. t0.90 = t-value at the 80-percent (two-sided) confidence</p><p class="depth0">level (see Table A-1). xavg = Average measured CE value (calculated from all valid</p><p class="depth0">test runs).</p><p class="depth0">4.9 The resulting LC1 is compared to the applicable CE  regulatory requirement. If LC1 exceeds (i.e., is higher than)  the applicable regulatory requirement, then a facility is in initial  compliance. However, if the LC1 is below the CE requirement,  then the facility must conduct additional test runs. After this point  the test results will be evaluated not only looking at the LCL, but also  the DQO of q5 percent of the mean at a 95 percent confidence  level. If the test results with the additional test runs meet the DQO  before the LCL exceeds the applicable CE regulatory requirement, then  the average CE value will be compared to the applicable CE regulatory  requirement for determination of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">4.10 If there is no specific CE requirement in the applicable  regulation, then the applicable CE regulatory requirement is determined  based on the applicable regulation and an acceptable destruction  efficiency test. If the applicable regulation requires daily compliance  and the latest CE compliance demonstration was made using the LCL  approach, then the calculated LC1 will be the highest CE  value which a facility is allowed to claim until another CE  demonstration test is conducted. This last requirement is necessary to  assure both sufficiently reliable test results in all circumstances and  the potential environmental benefits referenced above.</p><p class="depth0">4.11 An example of calculating the LCL is shown below. Facility B's  applicable regulatory requirement is 85 percent CE. Facility B conducted  a CE test using a traditional liquid/gas mass balance and submitted the  following results and the calculation shown in Equation 12:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Run                                   CE ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1..............................................................     94.2 2..............................................................     97.6 3..............................................................     90.5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Therefore:  n=3 t0.90 = 1.886 xavg = 94.1 s=3.55 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30MY96.033</p><p class="depth0">4.12 Since the LC1 of 90.23 percent is above the  applicable regulatory requirement of 85 percent then the facility is in  compliance. The facility must continue to accept the LC1 of  90.23 percent as its CE value until a new series of valid tests is  conducted. (The data generated by Facility B do not meet the specific  DQO criterion.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Recommended Reporting for Alternative CE Protocols</p><p class="depth0">5.1 If a facility chooses to use alternative CE protocols and test  methods that satisfy either the DQO or LCL and the additional criteria  in section 4., the following information should be submitted with each  test report to the appropriate regulatory agency:</p><p class="depth0">1. A copy of all alternative test methods, including any changes to  the EPA reference methods, QA/QC procedures and calibration procedures.</p><p class="depth0">2. A table with information on each liquid sample, including the  sample identification, where and when the sample was taken, and the VOC  content of the sample;</p><p class="depth0">3. The coating usage for each test run (for protocols in which the  liquid VOC input is to be determined);</p><p class="depth0">4. The quantity of captured VOC measured for each test run;</p><p class="depth0">5. The CE calculations and results for each test run;</p><p class="depth0">6. The DQO or LCL calculations and results; and</p><p class="depth0">7. The QA/QC results, including information on calibrations (e.g.,  how often the instruments were calibrated, the calibration results, and  information on calibration gases, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">6. Recommended Recordkeeping for Alternative CE Protocols.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 A record should be kept at the facility of all raw data recorded  during the test in a suitable form for submittal to the appropriate  regulatory authority upon request.
