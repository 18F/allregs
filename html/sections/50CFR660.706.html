                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest  HMS in their usual and accustomed (u&a;) fishing areas in U.S. waters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes means the Hoh, Makah, and  Quileute Indian Tribes and the Quinault Indian Nation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NMFS recognizes the following areas as marine u&a; fishing  grounds of the four Washington coastal tribes. The Makah u&a; grounds  were adjudicated in U.S. v. Washington, 626 F.Supp. 1405, 1466 (W.D.  Wash. 1985), affirmed 730 F.2d 1314 (9th Cir. 1984). The u&a; grounds of  the Quileute, Hoh, and Quinault tribes have been recognized  administratively by NMFS (See, e.g., 64 FR 24087 (May 5, 1999) (u&a;  grounds for groundfish); 50 CFR 300.64(i) (u&a; grounds for halibut)).  The u&a; grounds recognized by NMFS may be revised as ordered by a  Federal court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures. The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this  section will be implemented by the Secretary of Commerce, after  consideration of the tribal request, the recommendation of the   Council, and the comments of the public. The rights will be implemented  either through an allocation of fish that will be managed by the tribes,  or through regulations that will apply specifically to the tribal  fisheries. An allocation or a regulation specific to the tribes shall be  initiated by a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe  to the NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator, at least 120 days prior to  the time the allocation is desired to be effective, and will be subject  to public review through the Council process. The Secretary of Commerce  recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of Indian tribes  over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. Accordingly, the  Secretary of Commerce will develop tribal allocations and regulations in  consultation with the affected tribe(s) and, insofar as possible, with  tribal consensus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identification. A valid treaty Indian identification card issued  pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the  holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the  card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fishing (on a tribal allocation or under a Federal regulation  applicable to tribal fisheries) by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty  Indian tribe within that tribe's u&a; fishing area is not subject to  provisions of the HMS regulations applicable to non-treaty fisheries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply  with any applicable Federal and tribal laws and regulations, when  participating in a tribal HMS fishery implemented under paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe  outside that tribe's u&a; fishing area, or for a species of HMS not  covered by a treaty allocation or applicable Federal regulation, is  subject to the HMS regulations applicable to non-treaty fisheries.</p>
