If a utility files a rate increase within sixty days after filing another rate increase, the Commission will consider the filings together to be a phased rate increase request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This policy will not be applied if the increase is phased:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To coordinate with new facilities coming on line;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To implement a rate moderation plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To avoid price squeeze;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To comply with a settlement approved by the Commission; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the utility makes a convincing showing that application of the policy would be harsh and inequitable and that, therefore, good cause has been shown not to apply the policy in the case.
