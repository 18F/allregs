                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where to file. You must file a petition with the Regional  Director for the region in which the unit or employee(s) affected by  issues raised in the petition are located. If the unit(s) or employees  are located in two or more regions of the Authority, you must file the  petitions with the Regional Director for the region where the  headquarters of the agency or activity is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of filing. You may file a petition with the Regional  Director in person or by commercial delivery, first class mail,  facsimile, certified mail, or electronically through use of the eFiling  system on the FLRA's Web site at www.flra.gov. If you file  electronically or by facsimile transmission you are not required to file  an original copy of the petition with the Region. You assume  responsibility for the Regional Director's receipt of a petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date of filing. When a Regional Director receives a petition, it  is deemed filed. A petition filed during business hours by facsimile or  electronic means is deemed received on the business day on which it is  received (either by the Regional Office fax machine or by the eFiling  system), until midnight local time in the Region where it is filed. But  when a Region receives a petition by any other method after the close of  business day, it will be deemed received and docketed on the next  business day. The business hours for each of the Regional Offices are  set forth at http://www.flra.gov.</p>
