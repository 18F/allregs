                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each component, line, and fitting carrying flammable

fluids, gas, or air in any area subject to engine fire conditions must be at least fire resistant, except that flammable fluid tanks and supports which are part of and attached to the engine must be fireproof or be enclosed by a fireproof shield unless damage by fire to any non-fireproof part will not cause leakage or spillage of flammable fluid. Components must be shielded or located so as to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid. Flexible hose assemblies (hose and end fittings) must be shown to be suitable for the particular application. An integral oil sump of less than 25-quart capacity on a reciprocating engine need not be fireproof nor be enclosed by a fireproof shield.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lines, fittings, and components which are already approved as part of a type certificated engine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vent and drain lines, and their fittings, whose failure will not result in, or add to, a fire hazard.
