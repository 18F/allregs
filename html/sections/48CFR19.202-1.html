When applicable, the contracting officer shall take the following actions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Divide proposed acquisitions of supplies and services (except construction) into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plan acquisitions such that, if practicable, more than one small business concern may perform the work, if the work exceeds the amount for which a surety may be guaranteed by SBA against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ensure that delivery schedules are established on a realistic basis that

will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Encourage prime contractors to subcontract with small business concerns (see subpart 19.7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposed acquisition is for supplies or services currently being provided by a small business and the proposed acquisition is of a quantity or estimated dollar value, the magnitude of which makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed acquisition is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects and the magnitude of this consolidation makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed acquisition is for a bundled requirement.
