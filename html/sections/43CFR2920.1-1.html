A permit conveys no possessory interest. The permit is renewable at the discretion of the authorized officer and may be revoked in accordance with its terms and the provisions of Sec. 2920.9-3 of this title. Permits shall be issued on a form approved by the Director, Bureau of Land Management, that has been filed by the applicant with the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Easements may be used to assure that uses of public lands are compatible with non-Federal uses occurring on adjacent or nearby land.
