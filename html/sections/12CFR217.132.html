If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a Board-regulated institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter (except when a Board-regulated institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under Sec. 217.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a Board-regulated institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the Board-regulated institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

With the prior written approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may calculate haircuts (Hs and Hfx) using its own internal estimates of the volatilities of market prices and foreign exchange rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To receive Board approval to use its own internal estimates, a Board-regulated institution must satisfy the following minimum quantitative standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A Board-regulated institution must use a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The minimum holding period for a repo-style transaction is five business days and for an eligible margin loan is ten business days except for transactions or netting sets for which paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A)(3) of this section applies.

If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a Board-regulated institution must calculate the haircut using a minimum holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the Board-regulated institution must calculate the haircut for transactions in that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A Board-regulated institution is required to calculate its own internal estimates with inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the security or category of securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A Board-regulated institution must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the Board-regulated institution's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior approval of the Board for, and notify the Board if the Board-regulated institution makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Nothing in this section prevents the Board from requiring a Board-regulated institution to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of own internal estimates for haircuts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A Board-regulated institution must update its data sets and calculate haircuts no less frequently than quarterly and must also reassess data sets and haircuts whenever market prices change materially.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a Board-regulated institution may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the Board-regulated institution must at a minimum take into account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The type of issuer of the security;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The credit quality of the security;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The maturity of the security; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The interest rate sensitivity of the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> With respect to debt securities that are not investment grade and equity securities, a Board-regulated institution must calculate a separate haircut for each individual security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the Board-regulated institution must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A Board-regulated institution's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Simple VaR methodology. With the prior written approval of the Board, a

Board-regulated institution may estimate EAD for a netting set using a VaR model that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In such event, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to max {0, [([Sigma]E - [Sigma]C) + PFE]{time} , where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Sigma]E equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the netting set);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Sigma]C equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the Board-regulated institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the netting set); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> PFE (potential future exposure) equals the Board-regulated institution's empirically based best estimate of the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval for an increase in the value of ([Sigma]E - [Sigma]C) over a five-business-day holding period for repo-style transactions, or over a ten-business-day holding period for eligible margin loans except for netting sets for which paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section applies using a minimum one-year historical observation period of price data representing the instruments that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. The Board-regulated institution must validate its VaR model by establishing and maintaining a rigorous and regular backtesting regime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a Board-regulated institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period for the following quarter (except when a Board-regulated institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under Sec. 217.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, a Board-regulated institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the Board-regulated institution must set its PFE for that netting set equal to an estimate over a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> EAD for OTC derivative contracts--(1) OTC derivative contracts not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. A Board-regulated institution must determine the EAD for an OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> OTC derivative contracts not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. A Board-regulated institution must determine the EAD for an OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. A Board-regulated institution must determine the EAD for multiple OTC derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit derivatives. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Board-regulated institution that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under Sec. 217.134 or Sec. 217.135 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section so long as the Board-regulated institution does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Board-regulated institution that is the protection provider in a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as a wholesale exposure to the reference obligor and is not required to calculate a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this section, so long as it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes all or excludes all such credit

derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes (unless the Board-regulated institution is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the Board-regulated institution must calculate a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equity derivatives. A Board-regulated institution must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under Sec. Sec. 217.151-217.155 (unless the Board-regulated institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the Board-regulated institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in Sec. 217.155, the Board-regulated institution must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Single OTC derivative contract. Except as modified by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the EAD for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the Board-regulated institution's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the derivative contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract or zero; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PFE. The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 2 to Sec. 217.132. For purposes of calculating either the PFE under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the gross PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, the notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. For any OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 2 to Sec. 217.132, the PFE must be calculated using the ``other'' conversion factors. A Board-regulated institution must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2 to Sec. 217.132--Conversion Factor Matrix for OTC Derivative Contracts \1\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Credit</p><p class="depth0">Interest      Foreign       (investment-       Credit (non-               Precious</p><p class="depth0">Remaining maturity \2\                     rate     exchange rate   grade reference   investment-grade  Equity  metals (except   Other</p><p class="depth0">and gold        asset) \3\      reference asset)               gold)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One year or less.........................................      0.00            0.01              0.05               0.10    0.06            0.07    0.10Over one to five years...................................     0.005            0.05              0.05               0.10    0.08            0.07    0.12Over five years..........................................     0.015           0.075              0.05               0.10    0.10            0.08    0.15--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ For an OTC derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the</p><p class="depth0">derivative contract.\2\ For an OTC derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that</p><p class="depth0">the fair value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date. For an interest rate derivative contract</p><p class="depth0">with a remaining maturity of greater than one year that meets these criteria, the minimum conversion factor is 0.005.\3\ A Board-regulated institution must use the column labeled ``Credit (investment-grade reference asset)'' for a credit derivative whose reference</p><p class="depth0">asset is an outstanding unsecured long-term debt security without credit enhancement that is investment grade. A Board-regulated institution must use</p><p class="depth0">the column labeled ``Credit (non-investment-grade reference asset)'' for all other credit derivatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. Except as modified by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the EAD for multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE exposure for all OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net current credit exposure. The net current credit exposure is the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The net sum of all positive and negative fair values of the individual OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Zero; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusted sum of the PFE. The adjusted sum of the PFE, Anet, is calculated as
Anet = (0.4 x Agross) + (0.6 x NGR x Agross),

where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Agross = the gross PFE (that is, the sum of the PFE amounts (as determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section) for each individual derivative contract subject to the qualifying master netting agreement); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> NGR = the net to gross ratio (that is, the ratio of the net current credit exposure to the gross current credit exposure). In calculating the NGR, the gross current credit exposure equals the sum of the positive current credit exposures (as determined under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section) of all individual derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Collateralized OTC derivative contracts. A Board-regulated institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or single-product netting set of OTC derivatives by factoring the collateral into its LGD estimates for the contract or netting set. Alternatively, a Board-regulated institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by estimating an unsecured LGD for the contract or netting set and adjusting the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section using the collateral haircut approach in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

To obtain Board approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the following minimum standards, with which the Board-regulated institution must maintain compliance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Board-regulated institution must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Board-regulated institution must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate.

The Board-regulated institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the Board-regulated institution's counterparties. The Board-regulated institution must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the Board-regulated institution's portfolio. The Board may require the Board-regulated institution to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A Board-regulated institution must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the Board-regulated institution must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A Board-regulated institution must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> A Board-regulated institution must have a comprehensive stress testing program that captures all credit exposures to counterparties, and incorporates stress testing of principal market risk factors and creditworthiness of counterparties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Calculating the maturity of exposures.

A Board-regulated institution may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases, but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With prior written approval from the Board, a Board-regulated institution may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The Board-regulated institution may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral, plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is set according to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As an alternative to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, a Board-regulated institution that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The current exposure of the netting set reflecting all collateral held or posted by the Board-regulated institution excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. For purposes of this section, the add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure over the margin period of risk (set in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective EPE without a collateral agreement plus any collateral the Board-regulated institution posts to the counterparty that exceeds the required margin amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this part, including paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the margin period of risk for a netting set subject to a collateral agreement is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily remargining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced (except if the Board-regulated institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under Sec. 217.133). If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the Board-regulated institution must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set. If the periodicity of the receipt of collateral is N-days, the minimum margin period of risk is the minimum margin period of risk under this paragraph (d) plus N minus 1. This period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Five business days for an OTC derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the Board-regulated institution is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a

CCP or where the Board-regulated institution provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client. A Board-regulated institution must use a longer holding period if the Board-regulated institution determines that a longer period is appropriate. Additionally, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to set a longer holding period if the Board determines that a longer period is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Own estimate of alpha. With prior written approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the Board-regulated institution must meet the following minimum standards to the satisfaction of the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Board-regulated institution's own estimate of alpha must capture in the numerator the effects of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of fair values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across counterparties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a concentration in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is driven by a particular risk factor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Board-regulated institution must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Board-regulated institution must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Board-regulated institution must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Risk-based capital requirements for transactions with specific wrong-way risk. A Board-regulated institution must determine if a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, bond option, or equity derivative contract or purchased credit derivative to which the Board-regulated institution applies the internal models methodology under this paragraph (d) has specific wrong-way risk. If a transaction has specific wrong-way risk, the Board-regulated institution must treat the transaction as its own netting set and exclude it from the model described in Sec. 217.132(d)(2) and instead calculate the risk-based capital requirement for the transaction as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For an equity derivative contract, by multiplying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of Sec. 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The maximum amount the Board-regulated institution could lose on the equity derivative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a purchased credit derivative by multiplying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of Sec. 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair value of the reference asset of the credit derivative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a bond option, by multiplying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of Sec. 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The smaller of the notional amount of the underlying reference
