In the absence of prior approval from the authorized officer, no oil should go to a pit except in an emergency. Each such occurrence must be reported to the authorized officer and the oil promptly recovered in accordance with applicable orders and notices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Any person engaged in transporting by motor vehicle any oil from any lease site, or allocated to any such lease site, shall carry on his/her person, in his/her vehicle, or in his/her immediate control, documentation showing at a minimum; the amount, origin, and intended first purchaser of the oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any person engaged in transporting by motor vehicle any oil from any lease site, or allocated to any such lease site, shall carry on his/her person, in his/her vehicle, or in his/her immediate control, documentation showing at a minimum; the amount, origin, and intended first purchaser of the oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any person engaged in transporting any oil or gas by pipeline from any lease site, or allocated to any lease site, shall maintain documentation showing, at a minimum, the amount, origin, and intended first purchaser of such oil or gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On any lease site, any authorized representative who is properly identified may stop and inspect any motor vehicle that he/she has probable cause to believe is carrying oil from any such lease site, or allocated to such lease site, to determine whether the driver possesses proper documentation for the load of oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any authorized representative who is properly identified and who is accompanied by an appropriate law enforcement officer, or an appropriate law enforcement officer alone, may stop and inspect any motor vehicle which is not on a lease site if he/she has probable cause to believe the vehicle is carrying oil from a lease site, or allocated to a lease site, to determine whether the driver possesses proper documentation for the load of oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The operator shall conduct operations in such a manner as to prevent

avoidable loss of oil and gas. A operator shall be liable for royalty payments on oil or gas lost or wasted from a lease site, or allocated to a lease site, when such loss or waste is due to negligence on the part of the operator of such lease, or due to the failure of the operator to comply with any regulation, order or citation issued pursuant to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> When requested by the authorized officer, the operator shall furnish storage for royalty oil, on the leasehold or at a mutually agreed upon delivery point off the leased land without cost to the lessor, for 30 days following the end of the calendar month in which the royalty accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any records generated under this section shall be maintained for 6 years from the date they were generated or, if notified by the Secretary, or his designee, that such records are involved in an audit or investigation, the records shall be maintained until the recordholder is released by the Secretary from the obligation to maintain them.

Sec. 3162.7-4  Royalty rates on oil; sliding and step-scale leases (public land only).</p><p class="depth0">Sliding- and step-scale royalties are based on the average daily production per well. The authorized officer shall specify which wells on a leasehold are commercially productive, including in that category all wells, whether produced or not, for which the annual value of permissible production would be greater than the estimated reasonable annual lifting cost, but only wells that yield a commercial volume of production during at least part of the month shall be considered in ascertaining the average daily production per well. The average daily production per well for a lease is computed on the basis of a 28-, 29-, 30-, or 31-day month (as the case may be), the number of wells on the leasehold counted as producing, and the gross production from the leasehold. The authorized officer will determine which commercially productive wells shall be considered each month as producing wells for the purpose of computing royalty in accordance with the following rules, and in the authorized officer's discretion may count as producing any commercially productive well shut in for conservation purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For a previously producing leasehold, count as producing for every day of the month each previously producing well that produced 15 days or more during the month, and disregard

wells that produced less than 15 days during the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Wells approved by the authorized officer as input wells shall be counted as producing wells for the entire month if so used 15 days or more during the month and shall be disregarded if so used less than 15 days during the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the initial production of a leasehold is made during the calendar month, compute royalty on the basis of producing well days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When a new well is completed for production on a previously producing leasehold and produces for 10 days or more during the calendar month in which it is brought in, count such new wells as producing every day of the month in arriving at the number of producing well days. Do not count any new well that produces for less than 10 days during the calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Consider ``head wells'' that make their best production by intermittent pumping or flowing as producing every day of the month, provided they are regularly operated in this manner with approval of the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells produced for 15 days or more, compute royalty on the basis of actual producing well days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells were productive during the calendar month but from which oil was shipped, compute royalty at the same royalty percentage as that of the last preceding calendar month in which production and shipments were normal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rules for special cases not subject to definition, such as those arising from averaging the production from two distinct sands or horizons when the production of one sand or horizon is relatively insignificant compared to that of the other, shall be made by the authorized officer as need arises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)</em> In the following summary of operations on a typical leasehold for the month of June, the wells considered for the purpose of computing royalty on the entire production of the property for the months are indicated.

Wells No. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are counted as producing for 30 days. The average production per well per day is determined by dividing the total production of the leasehold for the month (including the oil produced by wells 4 and 8) by 5 (the number of wells counted as producing), and dividing the quotient thus obtained by the number of days in the month.

Sec. 3162.7-5  Site security on Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Appropriate valves. Those valves in a particular piping system, i.e., fill lines, equalizer or overflow lines, sales lines, circulating lines, and drain lines that shall be sealed during a given operation.</p><p class="depth0">Effectively sealed. The placement of a seal in such a manner that the position of the sealed valve may not be altered without the seal being destroyed.</p><p class="depth0">Production phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is delivered directly to or through production vessels to the storage facilities and includes all operations at the facility other than those defined by the sales phase.</p><p class="depth0">Sales phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is removed from the storage facilities for sales, transportation or other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Seal. A device, uniquely numbered, which completely secures a valve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minimum Standards. Each operator of a Federal or Indian lease shall comply with the following minimum standards to assist in providing accountability of oil or gas production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All lines entering or leaving oil storage tanks shall have valves capable of being effectively sealed during the production and sales operations unless otherwise modified by other subparagraphs of this paragraph, and any equipment needed for effective sealing, excluding the seals, shall be located at the site. For a minimum of 6 years the operator shall maintain a record of seal numbers used and shall document on which valves or connections they were used as well as when they were installed and removed. The site facility diagram(s) shall show which valves will be sealed in which position during both the production and sales phases of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) system shall employ meters that have non-resettable totalizers. There shall be no by-pass piping around the LACT. All components of the LACT that are used for volume or quality determinations of the oil shall be effectively sealed. For systems where production may only be removed through the LACT, no sales or equalizer valves need be sealed. However, any valves which may allow access for removal of oil before measurement through the LACT shall be effectively sealed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There shall be no by-pass piping around gas meters. Equipment which permits changing the orifice plate without bleeding the pressure off the gas meter run is not considered a by-pass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For oil measured and sold by hand gauging, all appropriate valves shall be sealed during the production or sales phase, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Circulating lines having valves which may allow access to remove oil from storage and sales facilities to any other source except through the treating equipment back to storage shall be effectively sealed as near the storage tank as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The operator, with reasonable frequency, shall inspect all leases to determine production volumes and that the minimum site security standards are being met. The operator shall retain records of such inspections and measurements for 6 years from generation. Such records and measurements shall be available to any authorized officer or authorized representative upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any person removing oil from a facility by motor vehicle shall possess the identification documentation required by appicable NTL's or onshore Orders while the oil is removed and transported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Theft or mishandling of oil from a Federal or Indian lease shall be reported to the authorized officer as soon as discovered, but not later than the next business day. Said report shall include an estimate of the volume of oil involved. Operators also are expected to report such thefts promptly to local law enforcement agencies and internal company security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any operator may request the authorized officer to approve a variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed by this section. The variance request shall be submitted in writing to the authorized officer who may consider such factors as regional oil field facility characteristics and fenced, guarded sites. The authorized officer may approve a variance if the proposed alternative will ensure measures equal to or in excess of the minimum standards provided in paragraph (b) of this section will be put in place to detect or prevent internal and external theft, and will result in proper production accountability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Site security plans. (1) Site security plans, which include the operator's plan for complying with the minimum standards enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section for ensuring accountability of oil/condensate production are required for all facilities and such facilities shall be maintained in compliance with the plan. For new facilities, notice shall be given that it is subject to a specific existing plan, or a notice of a new plan shall be submitted, no later than 60 days after completion of construction or first production or following the inclusion of a well on committed non-Federal lands into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement, whichever occurs first, and on that date the

facilities shall be in compliance with the plan. At the operator's option, a single plan may include all of the operator's leases, unit and communitized areas, within a single BLM district, provided the plan clearly identifies each lease, unit, or communitized area included within the scope of the plan and the extent to which the plan is applicable to each lease, unit, or communitized area so identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operator shall retain the plan but shall notify the authorized officer of its completion and which leases, unit and communitized areas are involved. Such notification is due at the time the plan is completed as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Such notification shall include the location and normal business hours of the office where the plan will be maintained. Upon request, all plans shall be made available to the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan shall include the frequency and method of the operator's inspection and production volume recordation. The authorized officer may, upon examination, require adjustment of the method or frequency of inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Site facility diagrams. (1) Facility diagrams are required for all facilities which are used in storing oil/condensate produced from, or allocated to, Federal or Indian lands. Facility diagrams shall be filed within 60 days after new measurement facilities are installed or existing facilities are modified or following the inclusion of the facility into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No format is prescribed for facility diagrams. They are to be prepared on 8\1/2\ x 11 paper, if possible, and be legible and comprehensible to a person with ordinary working knowledge of oil field operations and equipment. The diagram need not be drawn to scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A site facility diagram shall accurately reflect the actual conditions at the site and shall, commencing with the header if applicable, clearly identify the vessels, piping, metering system, and pits, if any, which apply to the handling and disposal of oil, gas and water. The diagram shall indicate which valves shall be sealed and in what position during the production or sales phase. The diagram shall clearly identify the lease on which the facility is located and the site security plan to which it is subject, along with the location of the plan.
