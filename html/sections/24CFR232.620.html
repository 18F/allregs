                            <p class="depth0">An application under this subpart must be accompanied by a statement from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or his designee, that the Secretary has determined that the physical plant of the facility, when the fire safety equipment has been installed, will be in compliance with the HHS requirements for fire safety and will meet other pertinent health and safety requirements of HHS for providers of services under title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicare and Medicaid). In lieu of a facility being able to meet HHS's requirements for other pertinent health and safety requirements at the time of application, HHS may accept a list of deficiencies from the State Agency responsible for determining compliance with HHS's requirements for other pertinent health and safety requirements for providers of such services along with a plan prepared by the applicant for correcting those deficiencies. In such event, HHS will inform HUD that, if the facility complies with such plan, the facility will meet the applicable health and safety requirements of HHS for providers of services under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act upon the installation of the fire safety equipment. The architectural exhibits, as approved, by HHS, together with any commitment requirements HHS deems appropriate, must accompany the statement. In the case of Intermediate Care Facilities, the statement by HHS to HUD will be based upon a determination that the facility has been approved in accordance with applicable HHS statutes and regulations, subject to the proper installation of the proposed equipment.</p>
