                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The DAEO may waive any provision of this part upon  finding that the waiver will not result in conduct inconsistent with 5  CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that application of  the provision is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the  impartiality and objectivity with which the programs of FHFA are  administered. Each waiver shall be in writing and supported by a  statement of the facts and findings upon which it is based and may  impose appropriate conditions, including but not limited to requiring  the employee to execute a written disqualification statement or an  agreement not to acquire additional securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver of prohibitions relating to ownership or control of  securities. The DAEO may grant a waiver permitting the employee or the  employee's spouse or minor children to own or control, directly or  indirectly, any security prohibited under Sec. 9001.104, if, in addition  to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extenuating circumstances exist, such as ownership or control of  the security was acquired:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to employment with FHFA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Through inheritance, gift, merger, acquisition, or other change  in corporate structure, or otherwise without specific intent on the part  of the employee, or employee's spouse or minor children, to acquire the  security; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By an employee's spouse or minor children as part of a  compensation package in connection with employment or prior to marriage  to the employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the prohibited financial interest has a market  value of less than the de minimis amount set forth in 5 CFR 2640.202(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee makes a prompt and complete written disclosure of  the interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the employee is required to disqualify himself or herself  from certain assignments, the disqualification does not unduly interfere  with the full performance of the employee's duties.</p>
