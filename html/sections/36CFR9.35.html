                            <p class="depth0">No operator may use for operations any water from a point of diversion which is within the boundaries of any unit unless authorized in writing by the Regional Director. The Regional Director shall not approve a plan of operations requiring the use of water from such source unless the operator shows either that his right to the use of the water is superior to any claim of the United States to the water, or where the operator's claim to the water is subordinate to that of the United States that the removal of the water from the water system will not damage the unit's resources. In either situation, the operator's use of water must comply with appropriate State water laws.</p>
