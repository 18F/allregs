                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory Factors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 20(b) of the CPSA, section  5(c)(3) of the FHSA, and section 5(e)(2) of the FFA, specify factors  considered by the Commission in determining the amount of a civil  penalty to be sought upon commencing an action for knowing violations of  each act. These factors are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2069(b)). The nature, circumstances, extent, and  gravity of the violation, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nature of the product defect;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The severity of the risk of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The occurrence or absence of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The number of defective products distributed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of  the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue  adverse economic impacts on small businesses; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Such other factors as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1264 (c)(3)). The nature, circumstances,  extent, and gravity of the violation, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nature of the substance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Severity of the risk of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The occurrence or absence of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The amount of substance distributed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of  the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue  adverse economic impacts on small businesses; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Such other factors as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> FFA (15 U.S.C. 1194 (e)(2)). The nature, circumstances,  extent, and gravity of the violations:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The severity of the risk of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The occurrence or absence of injury;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of  the business of the person charged; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Such other factors as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation.  Under this factor, the Commission will consider the totality of the  circumstances and all other facts concerning a violation. The Commission  will consider the enumerated statutory factors, as well as the factors  described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nature of the product defect. The Commission will consider the  nature of the product defect associated with a CPSA violation. This  consideration will include, for example, whether the defect arises from  the product's design, composition, contents, construction, manufacture,  packaging, warnings, or instructions, and will include consideration of  conditions or circumstances in which the defect arises. The Commission  will also consider the nature of the substance associated with an FHSA  violation. Two of the statutory factors in the CPSA civil penalty  factors include the terms ``product defect'' or ``defective products.''  However, certain violations of the CPSA, for example, failing to supply  a required certificate that the product complies with an applicable  consumer product safety rule, do not necessarily require that there be a  product defect or defective product. The terms ``product defect'' or  ``defective products'' would not apply to such situation. In such cases,  however, the other civil penalty factors would still be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Severity of the risk of injury. Consistent with its discussion  of severity of the risk at 16 CFR 1115.12, the Commission will consider,  among other factors, the potential for serious injury, illness, or death  (and whether any injury or illness required medical treatment including  hospitalization or surgery); the likelihood of injury; the intended or  reasonably foreseeable use or misuse of the product; and the population  at risk (including vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly,  or those with disabilities).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The occurrence or absence of injury. The Commission will  consider whether injuries, illnesses, or deaths have or have not  occurred with respect to any product or substance associated with a  violation, and, if so, the number and nature of injuries, illnesses, or  deaths. Both acute illnesses and the likelihood of chronic illnesses  will be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The number of defective products distributed. The Commission  will consider the number of defective products or amount of substance  distributed in commerce. The statutory language makes no distinction  between those defective products distributed in commerce that consumers  received and those defective products distributed in commerce that  consumers have not received. Therefore both could be considered in  appropriate cases. This factor will not be used to penalize a person's  decision to conduct a wider-than-necessary recall out of an abundance of  caution. This would not include situations where such a recall is  conducted   due to a person's uncertainty concerning how many or which products may  need to be recalled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of  the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue  adverse economic impacts on small businesses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission is required to consider the size of the business  of the person charged in relation to the amount of the penalty. This  factor reflects the relationship between the size of a business and the  policies behind, and purposes of, a penalty (as noted above in Sec.  1119.1). In considering business size, the Commission may look to  several factors including, but not limited to, the number of employees,  net worth, and annual sales. A business's size and a business's ability  to pay a penalty are separate considerations. In some cases for small  businesses, however, these two considerations may relate to each other.  The Commission will be guided, where appropriate, by relevant financial  factors to determine a small business's ability to pay a penalty,  including, but not limited to, liquidity, solvency, and profitability.  The burden to present clear, reliable, relevant, and sufficient evidence  relating to a business's size and ability to pay rests on the business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The statute requires the Commission to consider how to mitigate  the adverse economic impacts on small businesses only if those impacts  would be undue. What the Commission considers in determining what is  undue may include, but is not limited to, the business's size and  financial factors relating to its ability to pay. When considering how  to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts, the Commission will, as  appropriate, also follow its Small Business Enforcement Policy set forth  at Sec. 1020.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other factors as appropriate. In determining the amount of any  civil penalty to be sought for a violation of the CPSA, FHSA, or FFA,  the Commission may consider, as appropriate, such other factors in  addition to those listed in the statutes. Both the Commission and a  person may raise any factors they believe are relevant in determining an  appropriate penalty amount. A person will be notified of any factors  beyond those enumerated in the statutes that the Commission relies on as  aggravating factors for purposes of determining a civil penalty amount.  Additional factors that may be considered in a case include, but are not  limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety/compliance program and/or system relating to a violation.  The Commission may consider, when a safety/compliance program and/or  system as established is relevant to a violation, whether a person had  at the time of the violation a reasonable and effective program or  system for collecting and analyzing information related to safety  issues. Examples of such information would include incident reports,  lawsuits, warranty claims, and safety-related issues related to repairs  or returns. The Commission may also consider whether a person conducted  adequate and relevant premarket and production testing of the product at  issue; had a program in place for continued compliance with all relevant  mandatory and voluntary safety standards; and other factors as the  Commission deems appropriate. The burden to present clear, reliable,  relevant, and sufficient evidence of such program, system, or testing  rests on the person seeking consideration of this factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> History of noncompliance. The Commission may consider whether or  not a person's history of noncompliance with the CPSA, FHSA, FFA, and  other laws that the CPSC enforces, and the regulations thereunder,  should increase the amount of the penalty. A person's history of  noncompliance may be indicated by, for example, multiple violations of  one or more laws or regulations that the CPSC enforces, including  repeated violations of the same law or regulation. History of  noncompliance may include the number of previous violations or how  recently a previous violation occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Economic gain from noncompliance. The Commission may consider  whether a person benefitted economically from a failure to comply,  including a delay in complying, with the CPSA, FHSA, FFA, and other laws  that the CPSC enforces, and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to respond in a timely and complete fashion to the  Commission's requests for information or remedial action.   The Commission may consider whether a person's failure to respond in a  timely and complete fashion to requests from the Commission for  information or for remedial action should increase a penalty. This  factor is intended to address a person's dilatory and egregious conduct  in responding to written requests for information or remedial action  sought by the Commission, but not to impede any person's lawful rights.</p>
