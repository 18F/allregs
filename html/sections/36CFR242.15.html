                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board shall determine if an area or community in Alaska is rural. In determining whether a specific area of Alaska is rural, the Board shall use the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A community or area with a population of 2,500 or less shall be deemed to be rural unless such a community or area possesses significant characteristics of a non-rural nature, or is considered to be socially and economically a part of an urbanized area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Communities or areas with populations above 2,500 but not more than 7,000 will be determined to be rural or non-rural.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A community with a population of more than 7,000 shall be presumed non-rural, unless such a community or area possesses significant characteristics of a rural nature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Population data from the most recent census conducted by the United States Bureau of Census as updated by the Alaska Department of Labor shall be utilized in this process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Community or area characteristics shall be considered in evaluating a community's rural or non-rural status. The characteristics may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of fish and wildlife;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Development and diversity of the economy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Community infrastructure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Transportation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Educational institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Communities or areas which are economically, socially, and communally integrated shall be considered in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board shall periodically review rural determinations. Rural determinations shall be reviewed on a 10-year cycle, commencing with the publication of the year 2000 U.S. census. Rural determinations may be reviewed out-of-cycle in special circumstances. Once the Board makes a determination that a community has changed from rural to non-rural, a waiting period of 5 years shall be required before the non-rural determination becomes effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Current determinations are listed at Sec. 242.23.</p>
