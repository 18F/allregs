                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal  lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access  facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and  enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal  resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes  reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses  made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant  criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of  National Forest System lands in accordance with Sec. 251.57 of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of  access to the United States across the landowner's property where such  reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for  the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner  shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the  United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the  Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the  difference in value will be paid to the landowner. If the value of the  rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of- way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in  the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in Sec.  251.57(b)(5) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For access across National Forest System lands that will have  significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to  construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to  a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to  provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done  by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road  system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the  responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either  a private road or as a public road, as determined to be appropriate by  the authorizing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development  roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's  lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway,  the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to  perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and  adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the  Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter  into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to  ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities  are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and  maintenance responsibility for the road assumed by the appropriate  public road authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing  officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or  routes of access available by deed or under State or common law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse  impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and  endangered species, and other values of the Federal land;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably  possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and  is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the  plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands  or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across  non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all  legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal  lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In addition to the other requirements of this section, the  following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non- federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are  components of the National Wilderness Preservation System:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are  being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal  land used for similar purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The combination of routes and modes of travel, including  nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the  wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the  non-federally owned land;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests  in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the  need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.</p>
