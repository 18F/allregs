                            <p class="depth0">A Federal employee who is relocated to or from a point, or between points, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be subject to income tax by both the Federal Government and the government of Puerto Rico. However, under current Puerto Rico law, an employee receives a credit on his/her Puerto Rico income tax for the amount of taxes paid to the Federal Government. Therefore:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is equal to or lower than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then your agency uses the Federal marginal tax rates and the formula in Sec.  302-17.40(c) in calculating your CMTR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is higher than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, and if all of the states involved either have no income tax or allow an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the rate for Puerto Rico in place of the Federal marginal tax rate in the formula in Sec.  302-17.40(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is higher than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate and one or more of the state(s) involved does not allow an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and/or Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the formula below:
CMTR = P + S + L
Where:
P = Your Puerto Rico marginal tax rateS = Your state marginal tax rate, if anyL = Your local marginal tax rate, if any</p>
