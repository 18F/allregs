                            <p class="depth0">The following Army actions normally require an EA, unless they qualify for the use of a CX:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Special field training exercises or test activities in excess of five acres on Army land of a nature or magnitude not within the annual installation training cycle or installation master plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Military construction that exceeds five contiguous acres, including contracts for off-post construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Changes to established installation land use that generate impacts on the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alteration projects affecting historically significant structures, archaeological sites, or places listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Actions that could cause significant increase in soil erosion, or affect prime or unique farmland (off Army property), wetlands, floodplains, coastal zones, wilderness areas, aquifers or other water supplies, prime or unique wildlife habitat, or wild and scenic rivers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Actions proposed during the life cycle of a weapon system if the action produces a new hazardous or toxic material or results in a new hazardous or toxic waste, and the action is not adequately addressed by existing NEPA documentation. Examples of actions normally requiring an EA during the life cycle include, but are not limited to, testing, production, fielding, and training involving natural resources, and disposal/demilitarization. System design, development, and production actions may require an EA, if such decisions establish precedent (or make decisions, in principle) for future actions with potential environmental effects. Such actions should be carefully considered in cooperation with the development or production contractor or government agency, and NEPA analysis may be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Development and approval of installation master plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Development and implementation of Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans (INRMPs) (land, forest, fish, and wildlife) and Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plans (ICRMPs).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Actions that take place in, or adversely affect, important wildlife habitats, including wildlife refuges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Field activities on land not controlled by the military, except those that do not alter land use to substantially change the environment (for example, patrolling activities in a forest). This includes firing of weapons, missiles, or lasers over navigable waters of the United States, or extending 45 meters or more above ground level into the national airspace. It also includes joint air attack training that may require participating aircraft to exceed 250 knots at altitudes below 3000 feet above ground level, and helicopters, at any speed, below 500 feet above ground level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> An action with substantial adverse local or regional effects on energy or water availability. Such impacts can only be adequately identified with input from local agencies and/or citizens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Production of hazardous or toxic materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Changes to established airspace use that generate impacts on the environment or socioeconomic systems, or create a hazard to non-participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> An installation pesticide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and rodenticide-use program/plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Acquisition, construction, or alteration of (or space for) a laboratory that will use hazardous chemicals, drugs, or biological or radioactive materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> An activity that affects a federally listed threatened or endangered plant or animal species, a federal candidate species, a species proposed for federal listing, or critical habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Substantial proposed changes in Army-wide doctrine or policy that potentially have an adverse effect on the environment (40 CFR 1508.18 (b)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> An action that may threaten a violation of federal, state, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The construction and operation of major new fixed facilities or the substantial commitment of installation natural resources supporting new materiel at the installation.</p>
