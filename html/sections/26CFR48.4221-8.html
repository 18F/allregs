                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em>, (3) and (4) shall not apply to sales by a  manufacturer, producer, or importer of tires of the type used on highway  vehicles or inner tubes for tires sold for use by the purchaser on or in  connection with a qualified bus, or to the sales by a manufacturer,  producer, or importer of tread rubber sold for use by the purchaser in  the recapping or retreading of any tire to be used by the purchaser on  or in connection with a qualified bus if the requirements of this  section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Meaning of terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified bus. ``Qualified bus'' means an  intercity, local, or school bus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intercity or local bus. ``Intercity or local bus'' means any  automobile bus which is used predominantly (more than 50 percent) in  furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to  the general public if such transportation is scheduled and along regular  routes, or if the seating capacity of the bus is at least 20 adults (not  including the driver). In determining predominant use, mileage travelled  with passengers as well as mileage travelled incidental to such  passenger transportation, such as ``deadheading'', is counted. Under the  first alternative, the size of the bus is not relevant for purposes of  determining whether or not the use of the bus qualifies for the  exemption. Under the second alternative, for non-scheduled bus  operations, such as that provided by charter buses, the exemption is  available only if the bus has a passenger seating capacity of at least  20 adults and the transportation is available to the general public. For  purposes of determining whether the bus has a seating capacity of at  least 20 adults, the bus driver is not included. Service is available to  the general public if bus service is used in a passenger transportation  business in which service is offered to more than a limited number of  persons, groups, or organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> School bus. ``School bus'' means any automobile bus in which  ``substantially all'' (85 percent or more) of the use involves  transporting students and employees of a school. Incidental use  (deadheading) of the school bus without passengers to or from a point to  which students or employees of school are transported is considered to  be a use which involves transporting students or employees of schools. A  school is any educational organization which normally maintains a  regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled  body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its  educational activities are carried on. Tax-exempt schools, taxable  schools, and a private contractor who operates a bus for tax-exempt or a  taxable school may qualify for the tax exemption if all the requirements  of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1. A person's registration and right to sell or  purchase articles tax free may be revoked or suspended as provided in  Sec. 48.4222(c).1. Such a revocation or suspension shall be in addition  to any other penalties that may apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cross reference. For credit or refund, see section 6416(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Information; records--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information to be furnished to  purchaser. A manufacturer selling tires, tubes, or tread rubber tax free  under section 4221(e)(5) shall indicate to the purchaser that the  purchaser is obtaining the tires or tubes tax free for the purpose of  use on or in connection with a qualified bus, and that the purchaser is  obtaining the tread rubber tax free for use in the recapping or  retreading of tires to be used by the purchaser on or in connection with  a qualified bus. The manufacturer may transmit this information by any  convenient means, such as coding of sales invoices, provided that the  information is presented with sufficient particularity so that the  purchaser is informed that the purchaser has obtained the tires, tubes,  and tread rubber tax free.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Records of manufacturer. A manufacturer selling tires, tubes, or  tread rubber tax free under section 4221(e)(5) shall maintain in its  records the identity of the purchaser, a signed statement of the exempt  purpose for purchasing the tires, tubes, or tread rubber, and the  quantity of tires, tubes, or tread rubber sold tax free to each  purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records of purchaser. A person purchasing tires, tubes, or tread  rubber tax free under section 4221(e)(5) must maintain sufficient  records to establish that the tires, tubes, or tread rubber purchased  tax free has actually been used for that purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(5)</em> by reason of section 4221(c) for the  tax imposed by section 4061(b) if at the time of sale the selling  manufacturer has knowledge or reason to believe that the tires, tubes,  or tread rubber sold by it to the purchaser are not intended for use on  an intercity, local, or school bus, or that the purchaser has failed to  register, or that its registration has been revoked or suspended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. Section 4221(e)(5) (relating to tires, tubes,  and tread rubber) applies to sales on or after December 1, 1978. The  sale of tires, tubes, or tread rubber sold prior to that date is not  exempt from tax under section 4221(e)(5).  [T.D. 7834, 47 FR 42346, Sept. 27, 1982.

Except as provided in Sec. 48.4222(b)-1, tax-free  sales under section 4221 may be made only if the manufacturer, first  purchaser, and second purchaser, as the case may be, have been  registered by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application instructions. Application for registration under  section 4222 must be made in accordance with instructions for Form 637  (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> for evidence required in support of tax-free  sales to purchasers who are required to be registered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure to register.
