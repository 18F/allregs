                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em> and the reasons established by  the rules of common law or equity applicable as between private parties  in the courts of the United States. Reconsideration or a new hearing may  be granted on all or any of the issues. Arguments already made and  reinterpretations of old evidence are not sufficient grounds for  granting reconsideration, for altering or amending a decision, or for  granting a new hearing. Upon granting a motion for a new hearing, the  Board will take additional testimony and, if a decision has been issued,  either amend its findings of fact and conclusions or law or issue a new  decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. Any motion under 6101.26 (Rule 26) shall comply with  the provisions of 6101.8 (Rule 8) and shall set forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reason or reasons why the Board should consider the motion;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relief sought and the grounds therefor. If the Board  concludes that the reasons asserted for its consideration of the motion  are insufficient, it may deny the motion without considering the relief  sought and the grounds asserted therefor. If the Board grants the  motion, it will issue an appropriate order which may include directions  to the parties for further proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing. In an appeal or petition, a motion for  reconsideration, to alter or amend a decision or order, or for a new  hearing shall be filed within 30 calendar days after the date the moving  party receives the decision or order. In an application, such a motion  shall be filed within 7 working days after the date the moving party  receives the decision or order. Not later than 30 calendar days after  issuance of a decision or order, the Board may, on its own initiative,  order reconsideration or a new hearing or alter or amend a decision or  order for any reason that would justify such action on motion of a  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of motion. A motion pending under 6101.26 (Rule 26) does  not affect the finality of a decision or suspend its operation.</p>
