Free use may be granted to such bona fide settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals, for fencing, building, mining, prospecting and domestic purposes.

(Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 477, 551)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Free use will be granted individuals primarily to aid in the protection and silvicultural improvement of the forests. Except in unusual cases, the material will be restricted to dead, insect-infested, or diseased timber, logging debris, and thinnings. Other material may be granted in unusual cases where its refusal would cause unwarranted hardship. Where limited supply or other conditions justify such action, the free use of green material may be refused.</p>
