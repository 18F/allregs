Other Federal agencies have promulgated regulations which may affect labeling of articles, as described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has promulgated regulations to administer the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter II require warning labels for products containing certain specified substances. For example, S.D.A. Formula Nos. 3-A and 30 require warning labels because they contain methyl alcohol, a hazardous substance at levels of 4% or more by weight. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers who convey articles containing strong chemicals should refer to 16 CFR Chapter II for warning label requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.) has promulgated regulations to administer the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter I affect packaging and labeling of ``consumer commodities.'' The term ``consumer commodities'' generally means products intended for retail sale to an individual for personal or household use. The F.T.C. regulations do not apply to drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics for which the Food and Drug Administration enforces the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (see paragraph (d) of this section). Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers who convey articles which are ``consumer commodities'' should refer to 16 CFR Chapter I for packaging and labeling requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. The Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations in 21 CFR Chapter I to administer the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (as it applies to drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers who convey articles which are drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics should refer to 21 CFR Chapter I for packaging and labeling requirements.</p>
