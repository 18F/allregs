Such information may include, but  is not limited to, the dose, route of administration, frequency of use,  half-life of the ligand or carrier, half-life of the radionuclide, and  results of clinical and preclinical studies. FDA will establish  categories of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals based on defined  characteristics relevant to risk and will specify the amount and type of  safety data that are appropriate for each category (e.g., required  safety data may be limited for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with a  well established, low-risk profile). Upon reviewing the relevant product  characteristics and safety information, FDA will place each diagnostic  radiopharmaceutical into the appropriate safety risk category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Radiation safety assessment. The radiation safety assessment  must establish the radiation dose of a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical by  radiation dosimetry evaluations in humans and appropriate animal models.  The maximum tolerated dose need not be established.</p>
