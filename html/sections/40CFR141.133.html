                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. (1) Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system fails to monitor for TTHM, HAA5, or bromate, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average. Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system failure to monitor makes it impossible to determine compliance with MRDLs for chlorine and chloramines, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system fails to monitor for TTHM, HAA5, or bromate, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average. Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system failure to monitor makes it impossible to determine compliance with MRDLs for chlorine and chloramines, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All samples taken and analyzed under the provisions of this subpart must be included in determining compliance, even if that number is greater than the minimum required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, during the first year of monitoring under Sec.  141.132, any individual quarter's average will cause the running annual average of that system to exceed the MCL for total trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids

(five), or bromate; or the MRDL for chlorine or chloramine, the system is out of compliance at the end of that quarter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disinfection byproducts--(1) TTHMs and HAA5. (i) For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with MCLs in Sec.  141.64 must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected by the system as prescribed by Sec.  141.132(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> TTHMs and HAA5. (i) For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with MCLs in Sec.  141.64 must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected by the system as prescribed by Sec.  141.132(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with MCLs in Sec.  141.64 must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected by the system as prescribed by Sec.  141.132(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For systems monitoring less frequently than quarterly, systems demonstrate MCL compliance if the average of samples taken that year under the provisions of Sec.  141.132(b)(1) does not exceed the MCLs in Sec.  141.64. If the average of these samples exceeds the MCL, the system must increase monitoring to once per quarter per treatment plant and such a system is not in violation of the MCL until it has completed one year of quarterly monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation at the end of that quarter. Systems required to increase monitoring frequency to quarterly monitoring must calculate compliance by including the sample which triggered the increased monitoring plus the following three quarters of monitoring.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to Sec.  141.32 or Sec.  141.202, whichever is effective for your system, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a PWS fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bromate. Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more than one sample, the average f all samples taken during the month) collected by the system as prescribed by Sec.  141.132(b)(3). If the average of samples covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134. If a PWS fails to complete 12 consecutive months' monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chlorite. Compliance must be based on an arithmetic average of each three sample set taken in the distribution system as prescribed by Sec.  141.132(b)(2)(i)(B) and Sec.  141.132(b)(2)(ii). If the arithmetic average of any three sample set exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disinfectant residuals--(1) Chlorine and chloramines. (i) Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(1). If the average covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chlorine and chloramines. (i) Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(1). If the average covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(1). If the average covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where systems switch between the use of chlorine and chloramines for residual disinfection during the year, compliance must be determined by including together all monitoring results of both chlorine and chloramines in calculating compliance. Reports submitted pursuant to Sec.  141.134 must clearly indicate which residual disinfectant was analyzed for each sample.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chlorine dioxide. (i) Acute violations. Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(2). If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL, and on the following day one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system exceed the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take immediate corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL and

must notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system will also be considered an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for acute violations under subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acute violations. Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(2). If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL, and on the following day one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system exceed the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take immediate corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL and

must notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system will also be considered an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for acute violations under subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonacute violations. Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under Sec.  141.132(c)(2). If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceed the MRDL and all distribution system samples taken are below the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL at the point of sampling and will notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for nonacute violations under Sec.  141.32(e)(78) in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disinfection byproduct precursors (DBPP). Compliance must be determined as specified by Sec.  141.135(c). Systems may begin monitoring to determine whether Step 1 TOC removals can be met 12 months prior to the compliance date for the system. This monitoring is not required and failure to monitor during this period is not a violation. However, any system that does not monitor during this period, and then determines in the first 12 months after the compliance date that it is not able to meet the Step 1 requirements in Sec.  141.135(b)(2) and must therefore apply for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, is not eligible for retroactive approval of alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements as allowed pursuant to Sec.  141.135(b)(3) and is in violation. Systems may apply for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements any time after the compliance date. For systems required to meet Step 1 TOC removals, if the value calculated under Sec.  141.135(c)(1)(iv) is less than 1.00, the system is in violation of the treatment technique requirements and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q of this part, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to Sec.  141.134.
