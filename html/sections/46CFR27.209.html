The master or person in charge of a vessel may substitute, for the instruction required in paragraph (a) of this section, the viewing of video training materials concerning at least the contingencies listed in paragraph (a), followed by a discussion led by someone familiar with these contingencies. This instruction may occur either on board or off the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Participation in drills. Drills must take place on board the vessel, as if there were an actual emergency. They must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participation by all crewmembers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Breaking out and using, or simulating the use of, emergency equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Testing of all alarm and detection systems; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Putting on protective clothing (by at least one person), if the vessel is so equipped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safety orientation.
