                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will look to the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. When the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the requester's stated use of the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, it will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duplication means the process of making a copy of a requested record pursuant to this part. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable electronic documents, among others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or an institution of professional or vocational education which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FOIA means the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Office of Inspector General records means those records as defined generally in this section which are exclusively in the possession and control of the Office of Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records means books, papers, maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of whether the format is physical or electronic, made or received by the Corporation in connection with the transaction of the Corporation's business and preserved by the Corporation (either directly or maintained by a third party under contract to the Corporation for records management purposes), as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions procedures, operations, or other activities of the Corporation, or because of the informational value of data in them. The term does not include, inter alia, books, magazines, or other materials acquired solely for library purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Representative of the news media means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the journalist

can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Corporation may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Review means the process of examining documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of any such document is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any such documents for disclosure. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records that are responsive to a request for records. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. Searches may be conducted manually or by automated means and will be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Submitter means any person or entity from whom the Corporation receives grant application records.
