                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of gain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A partner that receives a  distribution of property (other than money) must recognize gain under  section 737 and this section in an amount equal to the lesser of the  excess distribution (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) or the  partner's net precontribution gain (as defined in paragraph (c) of this  section). Gain recognized under section 737 and this section is in  addition to any gain recognized under section 731.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions to which section 737 applies. Section 737 and this  section apply only to the extent that a distribution by a partnership is  a distribution to a partner acting in the capacity of a partner within  the meaning of section 731, except that section 737 and this section do  not apply to the extent that section 751(b) applies to the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Excess distribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. The excess distribution is  the amount (if any) by which the fair market value of the distributed  property (other than money) exceeds the distributee partner's adjusted  tax basis in the partner's partnership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fair market value of property. The fair market value of the  distributed property is the price at which the property would change  hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the time of the  distribution, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both  having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts. The fair market value  that a partnership assigns to distributed property will be regarded as  correct, provided that the value is reasonably agreed to among the  partners in an arm's-length negotiation and the partners have  sufficiently adverse interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributee partner's adjusted tax basis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In  determining the amount of the excess distribution, the distributee  partner's adjusted tax basis in the partnership interest includes any  basis adjustment resulting from the distribution that is subject to  section 737 (for example, adjustments required under section 752) and  from any other distribution or transaction that is part of the same  distribution, except for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The increase required under section 737(c)(1) for the gain  recognized by the partner under section 737; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>. See also Sec. 1.737- 3(b)(2) for a special rule for determining a partner's adjusted tax  basis in distributed property previously contributed by the partner to  the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em> on an actual distribution of contributed section 704(c)  property to another partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property contributed on or before October 3,  1989. Property contributed to the partnership on or before October 3,  1989, is not taken into account in determining a partner's net  precontribution gain. See Sec. 1.704-4(c)(1) for a similar rule in the  context of section 704(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 734(b)(1)(A) adjustments. For distributions to a  distributee partner of money by a partnership with a section 754  election in effect that are part of the same distribution as the  distribution of property subject to section 737, for purposes of  paragraph (a) and (c)(1) of this section the distributee partner's net  precontribution gain is reduced by the basis adjustments (if any) made  to section 704(c) property contributed by the distributee partner under  section 734(b)(1)(A). See Sec. 1.737-3(c)(4) for rules regarding basis  adjustments for partnerships with a section 754 election in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transfers of a partnership interest. The transferee of all or  a portion of a contributing partner's partnership interest succeeds to  the transferor's net precontribution gain, if any, in an amount  proportionate to the interest transferred. See Sec. 1.704-3(a)(7) and  Sec. 1.704-4(d)(2) for similar provisions in the context of section  704(c)(1)(A) and section 704(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 704(c)(1)(B) gain recognized in related distribution. A  distributee partner's net precontribution gain is determined after  taking into account any gain or loss recognized by the partner under  section 704(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.704-4 (or that would have been  recognized by the partner except for the like-kind exception in section  704(c)(2) and Sec. 1.704-4(d)(3)) on an actual distribution to another  partner of section 704(c) property contributed by the distributee  partner that is part of the same distribution as the distribution to the  distributee partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Section 704(c)(2) disregarded. A distributee partner's net  precontribution gain is determined without regard to the provisions of  section 704(c)(2) and Sec. 1.704-4(d)(3) in situations in which the  property contributed by the distributee partner is not actually  distributed to another partner in a distribution related to the section  737 distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Character of gain. The character of the gain recognized by the  distributee partner under section 737 and this section is determined by,  and is proportionate to, the character of the partner's net  precontribution gain. For this purpose, all gains and losses on section  704(c) property taken into account in determining the partner's net  precontribution gain are netted according to their character. Character  is determined at the partnership level for this purpose, and any  character with a net negative amount is disregarded. The character of  the partner's gain under section 737 is the same as, and in proportion  to, any character with a net positive amount. Character for this purpose  is determined as if the section 704(c) property had been sold by the  partnership to an unrelated third party at the time of the distribution  and includes any item that would have been taken into account separately  by the contributing partner under section 702(a) and Sec. 1.702-1(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section. Unless otherwise specified, partnership income equals  partnership expenses (other than depreciation deductions for contributed  property) for each year of the partnership, the fair market value of  partnership property does not change, all distributions by the  partnership are subject to section 737, and all partners are unrelated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, A, B, and C form  partnership ABC as equal partners. A contributes Property A, depreciable  real property with a fair market value of $30,000 and an adjusted tax  basis of   $20,000. B contributes Property B, nondepreciable real property with a  fair market value and adjusted tax basis of $30,000. C contributes  $30,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property A has 10 years remaining on its cost recovery schedule  and is depreciated using the straight-line method. The partnership uses  the traditional method for allocating items under section 704(c)  described in Sec. 1.704-3(b)(1) for Property A. The partnership has  book depreciation of $3,000 per year (10 percent of the $30,000 book  basis in Property A) and each partner is allocated $1,000 of book  depreciation per year (one-third of the total annual book depreciation  of $3,000). The partnership also has tax depreciation of $2,000 per year  (10 percent of the $20,000 adjusted tax basis in Property A). This  $2,000 tax depreciation is allocated equally between B and C, the  noncontributing partners with respect to Property A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At the end of 1997, the book value of Property A is $21,000  ($30,000 initial book value less $9,000 aggregate book depreciation) and  its adjusted tax basis is $14,000 ($20,000 initial tax basis less $6,000  aggregate tax depreciation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On December 31, 1997, Property B is distributed to A in  complete liquidation of A's partnership interest. The adjusted tax basis  of A's partnership interest at that time is $20,000. The amount of the  excess distribution is $10,000, the difference between the fair market  value of the distributed Property B ($30,000) and A's adjusted tax basis  in A's partnership interest ($20,000). A's net precontribution gain is  $7,000, the difference between the book value of Property A ($21,000)  and its adjusted tax basis at the time of the distribution ($14,000). A  recognizes gain of $7,000 on the distribution, the lesser of the excess  distribution and the net precontribution gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On  January 1, 1995, A, B, and C form general partnership ABC as equal  partners. A contributes Property A, nondepreciable real property with a  fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $4,000. B and  C each contributes $10,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership purchases Property B, nondepreciable real  property with a fair market value of $9,000, subject to a $9,000  nonrecourse liability. This nonrecourse liability is allocated equally  among the partners under section 752, increasing A's adjusted tax basis  in A's partnership interest from $4,000 to $7,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1998, A receives $2,000 cash and Property B,  subject to the $9,000 liability, in a current distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In determining the amount of the excess distribution, the  adjusted tax basis of A's partnership interest is adjusted to take into  account the distribution of money and the shift in liabilities. A's  adjusted tax basis is therefore increased to $11,000 for this purpose  ($7,000 initial adjusted tax basis, less $2,000 distribution of money,  less $3,000 (decrease in A's share of the $9,000 partnership liability),  plus $9,000 (increase in A's individual liabilities)). As a result of  this basis adjustment, the adjusted tax basis of A's partnership  interest ($11,000) is greater than the fair market value of the  distributed property ($9,000) and therefore, there is no excess  distribution. A recognizes no gain under section 737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, A, B, and C form  partnership ABC as equal partners. A contributes Properties A1 and A2,  nondepreciable real properties located in the United States each with a  fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $6,000. B  contributes Property B, nondepreciable real property located outside the  United States, with a fair market value and adjusted tax basis of  $20,000. C contributes $20,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1998, Property B is distributed to A in  complete liquidation of A's interest and, as part of the same  distribution, Property A1 is distributed to B in a current distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A's net precontribution gain before the distribution is $8,000  ($20,000 fair market value of Properties A1 and A2 less $12,000 adjusted  tax basis of such properties). A recognizes $4,000 of gain under section  704(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.704-4 on the distribution of Property A1 to B  ($10,000 fair market value of Property A1 less $6,000 adjusted tax basis  of Property A1). This gain is taken into account in determining A's  excess distribution and net precontribution gain. As a result, A's net  precontribution gain is reduced from $8,000 to $4,000, and the adjusted  tax basis in A's partnership interest is increased by $4,000 to $16,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A recognizes gain of $4,000 on the receipt of Property B under  section 737, an amount equal to the lesser of the excess distribution of  $4,000 ($20,000 fair market value of Property B less $16,000 adjusted  tax basis of A's interest in the partnership) and A's remaining net  precontribution gain of $4,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, A, B, and C  form partnership ABC as equal partners. A contributes the following  nondepreciable property to the partnership:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair</p><p class="depth0">market    Adjusted</p><p class="depth0">value    tax basis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Property A1.......................................    $30,000    $20,000 Property A2.......................................     30,000     38,000 Property A3.......................................     10,000      9,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The character of gain or loss on Property A1 and Property A2 is  long-term, U.S.-source capital gain or loss. The character of gain on  Property A3 is long-term, foreign-source capital gain. B contributes  Property B, nondepreciable real property with a fair   market value and adjusted tax basis of $70,000. C contributes $70,000  cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1998, Property B is distributed to A in  complete liquidation of A's interest in the partnership. A recognizes  $3,000 of gain under section 737, an amount equal to the excess  distribution of $3,000 ($70,000 fair market value of Property B less  $67,000 adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest) and A's net  precontribution gain of $3,000 ($70,000 aggregate fair market value of  properties contributed by A less $67,000 aggregate adjusted tax basis of  such properties).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In determining the character of A's gain, all gains and losses  on property taken into account in determining A's net precontribution  gain are netted according to their character and allocated to A's  recognized gain under section 737 based on the relative proportions of  the net positive amounts. U.S.-source and foreign-source gains must be  netted separately because A would have been required to take such gains  into account separately under section 702. As a result, A's net  precontribution gain of $3,000 consists of $2,000 of net long-term,  U.S.-source capital gain ($10,000 gain on Property A1 and $8,000 loss on  Property A2) and $1,000 of net long-term, foreign-source capital gain  ($1,000 gain on Property A3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The character of A's gain under paragraph (d) of this section is  therefore $2,000 long-term, U.S.-source capital gain ($3,000 gain  recognized under section 737x$2,000 net long-term, U.S.-source capital  gain/$3,000 total net precontribution gain) and $1,000 long-term,  foreign-source capital gain ($3,000 gain recognized under section 737 x  $1,000 net long-term, foreign-source capital gain/$3,000 total net  precontribution gain).
