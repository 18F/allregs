                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The military departments, when acting as a disposal agency, are authorized under the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 667b-d, in connection with land and improvements that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Can be utilized for wildlife conservation purposes by the agency of the state exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the state wherein the real property lies, or by the Secretary of the Interior; and (2) are chiefly valuable for use for any such purpose and which, in the determination of the GSA is available for such use, to convey such property to such agency without reimbursement or transfer of funds if the management thereof for the conservation of wildlife relates to other than migratory birds, or to the Secretary of the Interior if the property has particular value in carrying out the national migratory bird program. Personal property cannot be conveyed or transferred under this authority and only such improvements as the District Engineer determines to be necessary for proper execution of the applicant's program may be conveyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of availability. If property is considered by the District Engineer to be valuable for wildlife conservation purposes, or if interest has been shown in acquiring the property for that purpose, notice of availability should be given to the agency administering state wildlife resources and to the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service if the property has particular value in carrying out the national migratory bird program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classification--Factors to be considered and determinations to be made by disposal agency. Should the property be classified as being chiefly valuable for purposes other than wildlife conservation purposes, such as agricultural, commercial, etc., the property may not be transferred to any State or to the Department of the Interior, under the authority cited in paragraph (a) of this section. However, should an application be received for conveyance of the property for wildlife conservation purposes, and the classification of the property indicates that it is chiefly valuable for other purposes, the classification, all pertinent papers and the

application, together with the Division Engineer's recommendation, will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM), Washington, DC 20314. In addition to the determination that the property is chiefly valuable for wildlife conservation purposes and is available for such use, the Division Engineer will determine, when recommending that property be conveyed for such use, that the applicant has the legal and financial ability to acquire, operate and maintain the property as proposed, and will furnish information to DAEN-REM to support his opinion. With proper safeguards, contaminated property can be made available for use in the wildlife conservation program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application. Any state desiring to make application for property for wildlife conservation will be furnished copies of Application For Real Property For the Conservation of Wildlife with accompanying instructions for preparation. In evaluating the application, the responsible District Engineer will request review of the application by the Regional Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, and will obtain that Service's recommendation as to the value of the property for wildlife conservation purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Instrument of conveyance. Any instrument of conveyance of property for wildlife conservation will contain the restrictions and conditions required by 16 U.S.C. 667b, c, d. A Sample Deed for Conveyance of Land and Improvements For Conservation of Wildlife, with the statutory restrictions and conditions is provided as Figure 11-10 in ER 405-1-12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Publication of order. The order required to be published in the Federal Register after disposal of the property under this authority will be processed for publication by the Chief of Engineers.</p>
