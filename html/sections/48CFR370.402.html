                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assurances may be one of two following types:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full Animal Welfare Assurance (AWA). An AWA describes the institution's complete program for the care and use of animals, including but not limited to the facilities, occupational health, training, veterinary care, IACUC procedures and lines of authority and responsibility. An AWA listed in OLAW's list of institutions which have an approved full AWA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inter-institutional Agreement/Assurance (IAA). An IAA describes the arrangements between an offeror and usually a subcontractor where animal activities will occur. An IAA is limited to the specific award or single project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contracting Officer shall forward copies of proposals selected for negotiation and requiring an assurance to the Assurance Branch, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, NIH MSC 7507, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 3B01, Rockville, Maryland 20892, as early as possible to secure the necessary assurances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A contractor providing animal care services at an assured entity, such as a Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) site, does not need a separate assurance. GOCO site assurances normally cover such contractor services.</p>
