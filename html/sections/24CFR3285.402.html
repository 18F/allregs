The torque wrench is placed  on the top of the probe. The torque wrench is used to rotate the probe  steadily so one can read the scale on the wrench. If the torque wrench  reads 551 inch-pounds or greater, then a Class 2 soil is present  according to the Table to 24 CFR 3285.202(a)(3). A Class 3 soil is from  351 to 550 inch-pounds. A Class 4A soil is from 276 to 350 inch-pounds,  and a Class 4B soil is from 175 to 275 inch-pounds. When the torque  wrench reading is below 175 inch-pounds, a professional engineer should  be consulted.  [72 FR 59362, Oct. 19, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 53614, Sept. 10, 2014]</p>
