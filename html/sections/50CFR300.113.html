                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to national and international observers as defined in Sec. 300.101.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to a national observer aboard U.S. vessels harvesting in the Convention Area, national observers placed on foreign flagged vessels and international observers placed on U.S. vessels harvesting in the Convention Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All U.S. vessels fishing in the Convention Area must carry one or more scientific observers as required by CCAMLR conservation and management measures or as specified in a NMFS-issued AMLR Harvesting Permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All U.S. vessels conducting longline sink rate testing outside the Convention area and pursuant to CCAMLR protocols must carry one or more scientific observers as specified in a NMFS-issued AMLR Harvesting Permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procurement of observers by vessel. Owners of vessels required to carry scientific observers under this section must arrange for observer services in coordination with the NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division. The vessel owner is required to pay for observer services through an observer service provider who has provided observer services to the Federal government within the past year. In situations where no qualified observer is available through a qualified observer provider, the Secretary may authorize a vessel owner to arrange for an observer by alternative methods. An observer may not be paid directly by the vessel owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Insurance. The observer service provider or vessel owner must provide insurance for observers that provides compensation in the event of an injury or death during the entire deployment, from the point of hire location to return, equivalent to the standards of the North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program set forth in Sec. 679.80 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Educational requirements. National observer candidates must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Have a Bachelor's degree or higher from an accredited college or university with a major in one of the natural sciences; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Have successfully completed a minimum of 30 semester hours or equivalent in applicable biological sciences with extensive use of dichotomous keys in at least one course.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Health requirements. National observers must have a signed and dated statement from a licensed physician that he or she has physically examined

the observer. The statement must confirm that, based upon the physical examination, the observer does not have any health problems or conditions that would jeopardize that individual's safety or the safety of others while deployed, or prevent the observer from performing his or her duties satisfactorily. The statement must declare that prior to the examination; the physician was made aware of the duties of an observer and the dangerous, remote and rigorous nature of the work. The physician's statement must be submitted to the NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division program office prior to approval of an observer. The physical exam must have occurred during the 12 months prior to the observer's deployment. The physician's statement will expire 12 months after the physical exam occurred. A new physical exam must be performed, and accompanying statement submitted, prior to any deployment occurring after the expiration of the statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Vessel responsibilities. An operator of a vessel required to carry one or more scientific observers must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accommodations and food. Provide, at no cost to the observers or the United States, accommodations and food on the vessel for the observer or observers that are equivalent to those provided for officers of the vessel; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe conditions.

NMFS will grant a waiver from the Voluntary Safety decal provision if the vessel is in compliance with the standards of the observer vessel safety check list developed by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/fsb/ or equivalent certification issued by the Flagging State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Health and safety regulations. Comply with the Observer health and safety regulations at part 600 of this title. NMFS will grant a waiver from the Voluntary Safety decal provision if the vessel is in compliance with the standards of the observer vessel safety check list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transmission of data. Facilitate transmission of observer data by allowing observers, on request, to use the vessel's communications equipment and personnel for the confidential entry, transmission, and receipt of work-related messages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessel position. Allow observers access to, and the use of, the vessel's navigation equipment and personnel, on request, to determine the vessel's position, course and speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Access. Allow observers free and unobstructed access to the vessel's bridge, trawl or working decks, holding bins, processing areas, freezer spaces, weight scales, cargo holds, and any other space that may be used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Prior notification.
