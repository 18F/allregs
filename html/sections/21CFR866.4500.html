                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Immunoelectrophoresis equipment for clinical use  with its electrical power supply is a device used for separating protein  molecules. Immunoelectrophoresis is a procedure in which a complex  protein mixture is placed in an agar gel and the various proteins are  separated on the basis of their relative mobilities under the influence  of an electric current. The separated proteins are then permitted to  diffuse through the agar toward a multispecific antiserum, allowing  precipitation and visualization of the separate complexes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt  from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of  this chapter subject to the limitations in Sec. 866.9.  [47 FR 50823, Nov. 9, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 25047, June 12, 1989; 66  FR 38792, July 25, 2001]</p>
