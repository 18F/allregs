                            <p class="depth0">This part 90 establishes the option of miners who are employed at  coal mines and who have evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis to  work in an area of a mine where the average concentration of respirable  dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift is continuously maintained  at or below the applicable standard as specified in Sec. 90.100. The  rule sets forth procedures for miners to exercise this option, and  establishes the right of miners to retain their regular rate of pay and  receive wage increases. The rule also sets forth the operator's  obligations, including respirable dust sampling for part 90 miners. This  part 90 is promulgated pursuant to section 101 of the Act and supersedes  section 203(b) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as  amended.</p>
