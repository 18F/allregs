                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A prevailing party may receive an award for fees and expenses  incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and  discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, by or against NCUA  unless the position of NCUA during the proceeding was substantially  justified. The burden of proving that an award should not be made is on  counsel for NCUA. To avoid an award, counsel for NCUA must show that its  position was reasonable in law and in fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly  or unreasonably protracted the proceeding   or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where an applicant has prevailed on one or more discrete  substantive issues in a proceeding, even though all the issues were not  resolved in its favor, any award shall be based on the fees and expenses  incurred in connection with the discrete significant substantive issue  or issues on which the applicant's position has been upheld. If such  segregation of costs is not practicable, the award may be based on a  fair proration of those fees and expenses incurred in the entire  proceeding which would be recoverable under this section if proration  were not performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether separate or prorated treatment under the preceding  paragraph, including the applicable proration percentage, is appropriate  shall be determined on the facts of the particular case. Attention shall  be given to the significance and nature of the respective issues and  their separability and interrelationship.</p>
