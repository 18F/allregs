The discharge from this valve shall be piped to the outside of the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Direct-fired ovens. (i) Direct-fired ovens shall be safeguarded against failure of fuel, air, or ignition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct-fired ovens shall be safeguarded against failure of fuel, air, or ignition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To prevent the possible accumulation of explosive gases from being ignited after a shutdown, all direct-fired ovens with a heating capacity over 150,000 B.t.u. per hour shall be ventilated before the ignition system, combustion air blower, and the fuel can be turned on. The preventilation shall insure at least four complete changes of atmosphere in the baking chamber by discharging the oven atmosphere to the outside of the building and entraining fresh air into it. The preventilation shall be repeated whenever the heating equipment is shut down by a safety device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Direct recirculating ovens.
