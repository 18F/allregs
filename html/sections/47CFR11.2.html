                            <p class="depth0">The definitions of terms used in part 11 are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emergency Action Notification (EAN). The Emergency Action Notification is the notice to all EAS Participants and to the general public that the EAS has been activated for a national emergency. EAN messages that are formatted in the EAS Protocol (specified in Sec. 11.31) are sent from a government origination point to broadcast stations and other entities participating in the PEP system, and are subsequently disseminated via EAS Participants. Dissemination arrangements for EAN messages that are formatted in the EAS Protocol (specified in Sec. 11.31) at the State and local levels are specified in the State and Local Area plans (defined at Sec. 11.21). A national activation of the EAS for a Presidential message with the Event code EAN as specified in Sec. 11.31 must take priority over any other message and preempt it if it is in progress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Primary Entry Point (PEP) System. The PEP system is a nationwide network of broadcast stations and other entities connected with government activation points. It is used to distribute EAS messages that are formatted in the EAS Protocol (specified in Sec. 11.31), including the EAN and EAS national test messages. FEMA has designated some of the nation's largest radio broadcast stations as PEPs. The PEPs are designated to receive the Presidential alert from FEMA and distribute it to local stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Local Primary One (LP-1). The LP-1 is a radio or TV station that acts as a key EAS monitoring source. Each LP-1 station must monitor its regional PEP station and a back-up source for Presidential messages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EAS Participants. Entities required under the Commission's rules to comply with EAS rules, e.g., analog radio and television stations, and wired and wireless cable television systems, DBS, DTV, SDARS, digital cable and DAB, and wireline video systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wireline Video System. The system of a wireline common carrier used to provide video programming service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Participating National (PN). PN stations are broadcast stations that transmit EAS National, state, or local EAS messages to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> National Primary (NP). Stations that are the primary entry point for Presidential messages delivered by FEMA. These stations are responsible for broadcasting a Presidential alert to the public and to State Primary stations within their broadcast range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> State Primary (SP). Stations that are the entry point for State messages, which can originate from the Governor or a designated representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Intermediary Device. An intermediary device is a stand-alone device that carries out the functions of monitoring for, receiving and/or acquiring, and decoding EAS messages formatted in the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) in accordance with Sec. 11.56, and converting such messages into a format that can be inputted into a separate EAS decoder, EAS encoder, or unit combining such decoder and encoder functions, so that the EAS message outputted by such separate EAS decoder, EAS encoder, or unit combining such decoder and encoder functions, and all other functions attendant to

processing such EAS message, comply with the requirements in this part.
