These regulations are based upon a determination by the Administrator that the emission product of a fuel or additive will endanger the public health, or will impair to a significant degree the performance of a motor vehicle emission control device in general use or which the Administrator finds has been developed to a point where in a reasonable time it would be in general use were such regulations promulgated; and certain other findings specified by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this part is intended to preempt the ability of State or local governments to control or prohibit any fuel or additive for use in motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines which is not explicitly regulated by this part.
