In an agency that employs ten or more senior professionals, these controls must include centralized review of ratings proposed under Sec. 430.208 of this chapter and pay actions proposed under Sec. 534.507 by a panel of individuals designated by the agency head to provide advice from an agency-wide perspective for authorized agency officials to consider before approving pay adjustments on whether--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ratings of record and performance ratings proposed for senior professionals accurately reflect their individual performance, contributions to agency performance, or both, and take into account, as appropriate, assessment of the agency's performance against program performance measures and other relevant considerations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proposed pay adjustments for senior professionals conform to the requirements of Sec. 534.507 and appropriately correspond to proposed ratings of record and performance ratings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each agency's written procedure must provide that, effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule, the head of an agency will adjust a senior professional's rate of basic pay under the provisions of Sec. 534.507.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following actions must be approved by the agency head or by a designee who provides the certifications described in Sec. 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency, and this approval authority may not be further delegated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any pay-setting action under Sec. 534.506 or any pay increase under Sec. 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay that is within the highest 10 percent of the applicable rate range under Sec. 534.504.

above the amount derived using the following rules is considered to be within the highest 10 percent of the applicable pay range (in 2015, $177,166 or above if the applicable system is certified, or $164,026 or above if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subtract the minimum rate of basic pay from the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable rate range under Sec. 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300-$121,956 = $61,344 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700-$121,956 = $46,744 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiply the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by 0.10 (in 2015, $61,344 - 0.10 = $6,134 if the applicable system is certified, or $46,744 - 0.10 = $4,674 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subtract the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the maximum rate of basic pay applicable under Sec. 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300-$6,134 = $177,166 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700-$4,674 = $164,026 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any pay increase under Sec. 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay as in effect on the last day of the preceding fiscal year or, if the individual was first appointed as an SL or ST employee in the agency after the last day of the preceding fiscal year, more than 10 percent above the rate of basic pay set at the time of that appointment.
