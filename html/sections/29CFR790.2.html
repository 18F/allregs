                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The effect on the Fair Labor Standards Act of the various  provisions of the Portal Act must necessarily be determined by viewing  the two acts as interelated parts of the entire statutory scheme for the  establishment of basic fair labor standards. \7\ The Portal Act  contemplates that employers will be relieved, in certain circumstances,  from liabilities or punishments to which they might otherwise be subject  under the Fair Labor Standards Act. \8\ But the act makes no express  change in the national policy, declared by Congress in section 2 of the  Fair Labor Standards Act, of eliminating labor conditions ``detrimental  to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for  health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.'' The legislative  history indicates that the Portal Act was not intended to change this  general policy. \9\ The Congressional declaration of policy in section 1  of the Portal Act is explicitly directed to the meeting of the existing  emergency and the correction, both   retroactively and prospectively, of existing evils referred to therein.  \10\ Sponsors of the legislation in both Houses of Congress asserted  that it ``in no way repeals the minimum wage requirements and the  overtime compensation requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act''  \11\ that it ``protects the legitimate claims'' under that Act, \12\ and  that one of the objectives of the sponsors was to ``preserve to the  worker the rights he has gained under the Fair Labor Standards Act.''  \13\ It would therefore appear that the Congress did not intend by the  Portal Act to change the general rule that the remedial provisions of  the Fair Labor Standards Act are to be given a liberal interpretation  \14\ and exemptions therefrom are to be narrowly construed and limited  to those who can meet the burden of showing that they come ``plainly and  unmistakably within (the) terms and spirit'' of such an exemption. \15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\7\ As appears more fully in the following sections of this part,  the several provisions of the Portal Act relate, in pertinent part, to  actions, causes of action, liabilities, or punishments based on the  nonpayment by employers to their employees of minimum or overtime wages  under the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Section 13 of the  Portal Act provides that the terms, ``employer,'' ``employee,'' and  ``wage'', when used in the Portal Act, in relation to the Fair Labor  Standards Act, have the same meaning as when used in the latter Act.</p><p class="depth2">\8\ Portal Act, sections 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsors of the legislation asserted that the provisions of the  Portal Act do not deprive any person of a contract right or other right  which he may have under the common law or under a State statute.

The provisions of the Portal Act do  not directly affect the provisions of section 15(a)(1) of the Fair Labor  Standards Act banning shipments in interstate commerce of ``hot'' goods  produced by employees not paid in accordance with the Act's  requirements, or the provisions of section 11(c) requiring employers to  keep records in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the  Administrator. The Portal Act does not affect in any way the provision  in section 15(a)(3) banning discrimination against employees who assert  their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the provisions of  section 12(a) of the Act banning from interstate commerce goods produced  in establishments in or about which oppressive child labor is employed.  The effect of the Portal Act in relation to the minimum and overtime  wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act is considered in this  part in connection with the discussion of specific provisions of the  1947 Act.
