                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any corporation transfers, on or after January 1, 1951, and  before June 13, 1963, all or part of its property (other than money) to  a transferee corporation,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any corporation transfers, directly or indirectly, after June  12, 1963, all or part of its property (other than money) to a transferee  corporation, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of section 535(c), unless the  transferee establishes by the clear preponderance of the evidence that  the securing of such exemption or credit was not a major purpose of the  transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose of section 1551. The purpose of section 1551 is to  prevent avoidance or evasion of the surtax imposed by section 11(c) or  of the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531. It is not  intended, however, that section 1551 be interpreted as delimiting or  abrogating any principle of law established by judicial decision, or any  existing provisions of the Code, such as sections 269 and 482, which  have the effect of preventing the avoidance or evasion of income taxes.  Such principles of law and such provisions of the Code, including  section 1551, are not mutually exclusive, and in appropriate cases they  may operate together or they may operate separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and 269(b) to  allow one such exemption and credit and to apportion such exemption and  credit between corporations B and C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Actively engaged in business. For purposes of this section, a  corporation maintaining an office for the purpose of preserving its  corporate existence is not considered to be ``actively engaged in  business'' even though such corporation may be deemed to be ``doing  business'' for other purposes. Similarly, for purposes of this section,  a corporation engaged in winding up its affairs, prior to an acquisition  to which section 1551 is applicable, is not considered to be ``actively  engaged in business.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Meaning and application of the term ``control''--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  For purposes of this section, the term ``control'' means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With respect to a transferee corporation described in paragraph  (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the ownership by the transferor  corporation, its shareholders, or both, of stock possessing either (a)  at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of  stock entitled to vote, or (b) at least 80 percent of the total value of  shares of all classes of stock.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to each corporation described in paragraph (a)(3)  of this section, the ownership by five or fewer individuals of stock  possessing (a) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of  all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the  total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation,  and (b) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all  classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total  value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into  account the stock ownership of each such individual only to the extent  such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. On January 1, 1964, individual A, who owns 50 percent of  the voting stock of corporation X, and individual B, who owns 30 percent  of such voting stock, transfer property (other than money) to  corporation Y (newly created for the purpose of acquiring such property)  in exchange for all of Y's voting stock. After the transfer, A and B own  the voting stock of corporations X and Y in the following proportions:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Identical</p><p class="depth3">Individual                 Corp. X     Corp. Y    ownership ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A...................................          50          30          30 B...................................          30          50          30</p><p class="depth3">-----------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Total.............................          80          80          60 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   The transfer of property by A and B to corporation Y is a transfer  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section since (i) A and B own at  least 80 percent of the voting stock of corporations X and Y, and (ii)  taking into account each such individual's stock ownership only to the  extent such ownership is identical with respect to each such  corporation, A and B own more than 50 percent of the voting stock of  corporations X and Y.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Taxable year of allowance or disallowance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  district director's authority with respect to cases covered by section  1551 is not limited to the taxable year of the transferee corporation in  which the transfer of property occurs. Such authority extends to the  taxable year in which the transfer occurs or any subsequent taxable year  of the transferee corporation if, during any part of such year, the  transferor or transferors are in control of the transferee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On January 1, 1955, corporation D transfers property  (other than money) to corporation E, a corporation not actively engaged  in business at the time of the acquisition of such property, in exchange  for 60 percent of the voting stock of E. During a later taxable year of  E, corporation D acquires an additional 20 percent of such voting stock.  As a result of such additional acquisition, D owns 80 percent of the  voting stock of E. Accordingly, section 1551(a)(1) is applicable for the  taxable year in which the later acquisition of stock occurred and for  each taxable year thereafter in which the requisite control continues.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. On June 20, 1963, individual A, who owns all of the stock  of corporation X, transfers property (other than money) to corporation  Y, a corporation not actively engaged in business at the time of the  acquisition of such property, in exchange for 60 percent of the voting  stock of Y. During a later taxable year of Y, A acquires an additional  20 percent of such voting stock. After such acquisition A owns at least  80 percent of the voting stock of corporations X and Y. Accordingly,  section 1551(a)(3) is applicable for the taxable year in which the later  acquisition of stock occurred and for each taxable year thereafter in  which the requisite control continues.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Individuals A and B each owns 50 percent of the stock of  corporation X. On January 15, 1964, A transfers property (other than  money) to corporation Y (newly created by A for the purpose of acquiring  such property) in exchange for all the stock of Y. In a subsequent  taxable year of Y, individual B buys 50 percent of the stock which A  owns in Y (or he transfers money to Y in exchange for its stock, as a  result of which he owns 50   percent of Y's stock). Immediately thereafter the stock ownership of A  and B in corporation Y is identical to their stock ownership in  corporation X. Accordingly, section 1551(a)(3) is applicable for the  taxable year in which B acquires stock in corporation Y (see paragraph  (g)(3) of this section) and for each taxable year thereafter in which  the requisite control continues. Moreover, if B's acquisition of stock  in Y is pursuant to a preexisting agreement with A, A's transfer to Y  and B's acquisition of Y's stock are considered a single transaction and  section 1551(a)(3) also would be applicable for the taxable year in  which A's transfer to Y took place and for each taxable year thereafter  in which the requisite control continues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nature of transfer--(1) Corporate transfers before June 13,  1963. A transfer made before June 13, 1963, by any corporation of all or  part of its assets, whether or not such transfer qualifies as a  reorganization under section 368, is within the scope of section  1551(a)(1), except that section 1551(a)(1) does not apply to a transfer  of money only. For example, the transfer of cash for the purpose of  expanding the business of the transferor corporation through the  formation of a new corporation is not a transfer within the scope of  section 1551(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, irrespective of whether the new corporation uses the  cash to purchase from the transferor corporation stock in trade or  similar property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, whether or not the purchase follows a  transfer of cash from the controlling corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> notwithstanding that the other  individuals transfer nothing or transfer only money.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Individuals A and B each owns 50 percent of the voting  stock of corporation X. On January 15, 1964, A and B each acquires  property (other than money) from X and, as part of the same transaction,  each transfers such property to his wholly owned corporation (newly  created for the purpose of acquiring such property). A and B retain  substantial continuing interests in corporation X. The transfers to the  two newly created corporations are within the scope of section  1551(a)(2).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Corporation W organizes corporation X, a wholly owned  subsidiary, for the purpose of acquiring the properties of corporation  Y. Pursuant to a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C),  substantially all of the properties of corporation Y are transferred on  June 15, 1963, to corporation X solely in exchange for voting stock of  corporation W. There is a transfer of property from W to X within the  meaning of section 1551(a)(2).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Individuals A and B, each owning 50 percent of the voting  stock of corporation X, organize corporation Y to which each transfers  money only in exchange for 50 percent of the stock of Y. Subsequently, Y  uses such money to acquire other property from A and B after June 12,  1963. Such acquisition is within the scope of section 1551(a)(3).</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Individual A owns 55 percent of the stock of corporation  X. Another 25 percent of corporation X's stock is owned in the aggregate  by individuals B, C, D, and E. On June 15, 1963, individual A transfers  property to corporation Y (newly created for the purpose of acquiring  such property) in exchange for 60 percent of the stock of Y, and B, C,  and D acquire all of the remaining stock of Y. The transfer is within  the scope of section 1551(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Purpose of transfer. In determining, for purposes of this  section, whether the securing of the surtax exemption or accumulated  earnings credit constituted ``a major purpose'' of the transfer, all  circumstances relevant to the transfer shall be considered. ``A major  purpose'' will not be inferred from the mere purchase of inventory by a  subsidiary from a centralized warehouse maintained by its parent  corporation or by another subsidiary of the parent corporation. For  disallowance of the surtax exemption and accumulated earnings credit  under section 1551, it is not necessary that the obtaining of either  such credit or exemption, or both, have been the sole or principal  purpose of the transfer of the property. It is sufficient if it appears,  in the light of all the facts and circumstances, that the obtaining of  such exemption or credit, or both, was one of the major considerations  that prompted the transfer. Thus, the securing of the surtax exemption  or the accumulated earnings credit may constitute ``a major purpose'' of  the transfer, notwithstanding that such transfer was effected for a  valid business purpose and qualified as a reorganization within the  meaning of section 368. The taxpayer's burden of establishing by the  clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of either such  exemption or credit or both was not ``a major purpose'' of the transfer  may be met, for example, by showing that the obtaining of such  exemption, or credit, or both, was not a major factor in relationship to  the other consideration or considerations which prompted the transfer.
