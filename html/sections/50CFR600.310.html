                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Standard 1. Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield (OY) from each fishery for the U.S. fishing industry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General. (1) The guidelines set forth in this section describe fishery management approaches to meet the objectives of National Standard 1 (NS1), and include guidance on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The guidelines set forth in this section describe fishery management approaches to meet the objectives of National Standard 1 (NS1), and include guidance on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specifying maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and OY;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specifying status determination criteria (SDC) so that overfishing and overfished determinations can be made for stocks and stock complexes that are part of a fishery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Preventing overfishing and achieving OY, incorporation of scientific and management uncertainty in control rules, and adaptive management using annual catch limits (ACL) and measures to ensure accountability (AM); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rebuilding stocks and stock complexes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overview of Magnuson-Stevens Act concepts and provisions related to NS1--(i) MSY. The Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes MSY as the basis for fishery management and requires that: The fishing mortality rate does not jeopardize the capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY; the abundance of an overfished stock or stock complex be rebuilt to a level that is capable of producing MSY; and OY not exceed MSY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> MSY. The Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes MSY as the basis for fishery management and requires that: The fishing mortality rate does not jeopardize the capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY; the abundance of an overfished stock or stock complex be rebuilt to a level that is capable of producing MSY; and OY not exceed MSY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> OY. The determination of OY is a decisional mechanism for resolving the Magnuson-Stevens Act's conservation and management objectives, achieving a fishery management plan's (FMP) objectives, and balancing the various interests that comprise the greatest overall benefits to the Nation. OY is based on MSY as reduced under paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. The most important limitation on the specification of OY is that the choice of OY and the conservation and management measures proposed to achieve it must prevent overfishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ACLs and AMs. Any FMP which is prepared by any Council shall establish a mechanism for specifying ACLs in the FMP (including a multiyear plan), implementing regulations, or annual specifications, at a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, including measures to ensure accountability (Magnuson-Stevens Act

section 303(a)(15)). Subject to certain exceptions and circumstances described in paragraph (h) of this section, this requirement takes effect in fishing year 2010, for fisheries determined subject to overfishing, and in fishing year 2011, for all other fisheries (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). ``Council'' includes the Regional Fishery Management Councils and the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate (see Sec. 600.305(c)(11)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reference points. SDC, MSY, acceptable biological catch (ABC), and ACL, which are described further in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, are collectively referred to as ``reference points.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Scientific advice. The Magnuson-Stevens Act has requirements regarding scientific and statistical committees (SSC) of the Regional Fishery Management Councils, including but not limited to, the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each Regional Fishery Management Council shall establish an SSC as described in section 302(g)(1)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each SSC shall provide its Regional Fishery Management Council recommendations for ABC as well as other scientific advice, as described in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Secretary and each Regional Fishery Management Council may establish a peer review process for that Council for scientific information used to advise the Council about the conservation and management of a fishery (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(E)). If a peer review process is established, it should investigate the technical merits of stock assessments and other scientific information used by the SSC or agency or international scientists, as appropriate. For Regional Fishery Management Councils, the peer review process is not a substitute for the SSC and should work in conjunction with the SSC. For the Secretary, which does not have an SSC, the peer review process should provide the scientific information necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Each Council shall develop ACLs for each of its managed fisheries that may not exceed the ``fishing level recommendations'' of its SSC or peer review process (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(h)(6)). The SSC recommendation that is the most relevant to ACLs is ABC, as both ACL and ABC are levels of annual catch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approach for setting limits and accountability measures, including targets, for consistency with NS1. In general, when specifying limits and accountability measures intended to avoid overfishing and achieve sustainable fisheries, Councils must take an approach that considers uncertainty in scientific information and management control of the fishery. These guidelines describe how to address uncertainty such that there is a low risk that limits are exceeded as described in paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Summary of items to include in FMPs related to NS1. This section provides a summary of items that Councils must include in their FMPs and FMP amendments in order to address ACL, AM, and other aspects of the NS1 guidelines. As described in further detail in paragraph (d) of this section, Councils may review their FMPs to decide if all stocks are ``in the fishery'' or whether some fit the category of ``ecosystem component species.'' Councils must also describe fisheries data for the stocks, stock complexes, and ecosystem component species in their FMPs, or associated public documents such as Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Reports. For all stocks and stock complexes that are ``in the fishery'' (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the Councils must evaluate and describe the following items in their FMPs and amend the FMPs, if necessary, to align their management objectives to end or prevent overfishing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> MSY and SDC (see paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> OY at the stock, stock complex, or fishery level and provide the OY specification analysis (see paragraph (e)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ABC control rule (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mechanisms for specifying ACLs and possible sector-specific ACLs in relationship to the ABC (see paragraphs (f)(5) and (h) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> AMs (see paragraphs (g) and (h)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Stocks and stock complexes that have statutory exceptions from ACLs (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section) or which fall under limited circumstances which require different approaches to meet the ACL requirements (see paragraph (h)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Classifying stocks in an FMP--(1) Introduction. Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303(a)(2) requires that an FMP contain, among other things, a description of the species of fish involved in the fishery. The relevant Council determines which specific target stocks and/or non-target stocks to include in a fishery. This section provides that a Council may, but is not required to, use an ``ecosystem component (EC)'' species classification. As a default, all stocks in an FMP are considered to be ``in the fishery,'' unless they are identified as EC species (see Sec. 600.310(d)(5)) through an FMP amendment process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303(a)(2) requires that an FMP contain, among other things, a description of the species of fish involved in the fishery. The relevant Council determines which specific target stocks and/or non-target stocks to include in a fishery. This section provides that a Council may, but is not required to, use an ``ecosystem component (EC)'' species classification. As a default, all stocks in an FMP are considered to be ``in the fishery,'' unless they are identified as EC species (see Sec. 600.310(d)(5)) through an FMP amendment process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stocks in a fishery. Stocks in a fishery may be grouped into stock complexes, as appropriate. Requirements for reference points and management measures for these stocks are described throughout these guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Target stocks'' are stocks that fishers seek to catch for sale or personal use, including ``economic discards'' as defined under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ``Non-target species'' and ``non-target stocks'' are fish caught incidentally during the pursuit of target stocks in a fishery, including ``regulatory discards'' as defined under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(38). They may or may not be retained for sale or personal use. Non-target species may be included in a fishery and, if so, they should be identified at the stock level. Some non-target species may be identified in an FMP as ecosystem component (EC) species or stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ecosystem component (EC) species. (i) To be considered for possible classification as an EC species, the species should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be considered for possible classification as an EC species, the species should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be a non-target species or non-target stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Not be determined to be subject to overfishing, approaching overfished, or overfished;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Not be likely to become subject to overfishing or overfished, according to the best available information, in the absence of conservation and management measures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Not generally be retained for sale or personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Occasional retention of the species would not, in and of itself, preclude consideration of the species under the EC classification. In addition to the general factors noted in paragraphs (d)(5)(i)(A)-(D) of this section, it is important to consider whether use of the EC species classification in a given instance is consistent with MSA conservation and management requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EC species may be identified at the species or stock level, and may be grouped into complexes. EC species may, but are not required to, be included in an FMP or FMP amendment for any of the following reasons: For data collection purposes; for ecosystem considerations related to specification of OY for the associated fishery; as considerations in the development of conservation and management measures for the associated fishery; and/or to address other ecosystem issues. While EC species are not considered to be ``in the fishery,'' a Council should consider measures for the fishery to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality of EC species consistent with National Standard 9, and to protect their associated role in the ecosystem. EC species do not require specification of reference points but should be monitored to the extent that any new pertinent scientific information becomes available (e.g., catch trends, vulnerability, etc.) to determine changes in their status or their vulnerability to the fishery. If necessary, they should be reclassified as ``in the fishery.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reclassification. A Council should monitor the catch resulting from a fishery on a regular basis to determine if the stocks and species are appropriately classified in the FMP. If the criteria previously used to classify a stock or species is no longer valid, the Council should reclassify it through an FMP amendment, which documents rationale for the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Stocks or species identified in more than one FMP. If a stock is identified in

more than one fishery, Councils should choose which FMP will be the primary FMP in which management objectives, SDC, the stock's overall ACL and other reference points for the stock are established. Conservation and management measures in other FMPs in which the stock is identified as part of a fishery should be consistent with the primary FMP's management objectives for the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Stock complex. ``Stock complex'' means a group of stocks that are sufficiently similar in geographic distribution, life history, and vulnerabilities to the fishery such that the impact of management actions on the stocks is similar. At the time a stock complex is established, the FMP should provide a full and explicit description of the proportional composition of each stock in the stock complex, to the extent possible. Stocks may be grouped into complexes for various reasons, including where stocks in a multispecies fishery cannot be targeted independent of one another and MSY can not be defined on a stock-by-stock basis (see paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section); where there is insufficient data to measure their status relative to SDC; or when it is not feasible for fishermen to distinguish individual stocks among their catch. The vulnerability of stocks to the fishery should be evaluated when determining if a particular stock complex should be established or reorganized, or if a particular stock should be included in a complex. Stock complexes may be comprised of: one or more indicator stocks, each of which has SDC and ACLs, and several other stocks; several stocks without an indicator stock, with SDC and an ACL for the complex as a whole; or one of more indicator stocks, each of which has SDC and management objectives, with an ACL for the complex as a whole (this situation might be applicable to some salmon species).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Indicator stocks. An indicator stock is a stock with measurable SDC that can be used to help manage and evaluate more poorly known stocks that are in a stock complex. If an indicator stock is used to evaluate the status of a complex, it should be representative of the typical status of each stock within the complex, due to similarity in vulnerability. If the stocks within a stock complex have a wide range of vulnerability, they should be reorganized into different stock complexes that have similar vulnerabilities; otherwise the indicator stock should be chosen to represent the more vulnerable stocks within the complex. In instances where an indicator stock is less vulnerable than other members of the complex, management measures need to be more conservative so that the more vulnerable members of the complex are not at risk from the fishery. More than one indicator stock can be selected to provide more information about the status of the complex. When indicator stock(s) are used, periodic re-evaluation of available quantitative or qualitative information (e.g., catch trends, changes in vulnerability, fish health indices, etc.) is needed to determine whether a stock is subject to overfishing, or is approaching (or in) an overfished condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Vulnerability. A stock's vulnerability is a combination of its productivity, which depends upon its life history characteristics, and its susceptibility to the fishery. Productivity refers to the capacity of the stock to produce MSY and to recover if the population is depleted, and susceptibility is the potential for the stock to be impacted by the fishery, which includes direct captures, as well as indirect impacts to the fishery (e.g., loss of habitat quality). Councils in consultation with their SSC, should analyze the vulnerability of stocks in stock complexes where possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Features of MSY, SDC, and OY--(1) MSY. Each FMP must include an estimate of MSY for the stocks and stock complexes in the fishery, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> MSY. Each FMP must include an estimate of MSY for the stocks and stock complexes in the fishery, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions. (A) MSY is the largest long-term average catch or yield that can be taken from a stock or stock complex under prevailing ecological, environmental conditions and fishery technological characteristics (e.g., gear selectivity), and the distribution of catch among fleets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> MSY is the largest long-term average catch or yield that can be taken from a stock or stock complex under prevailing ecological, environmental conditions and fishery technological characteristics (e.g., gear selectivity), and the distribution of catch among fleets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> MSY fishing mortality rate (Fmsy) is the fishing mortality rate that, if applied over the long term, would result in MSY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> MSY stock size (Bmsy) means the long-term average size of the stock or stock complex, measured in terms of spawning biomass or other appropriate measure of the stock's reproductive potential that would be achieved by fishing at Fmsy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> MSY for stocks. MSY should be estimated for each stock based on the best scientific information available (see Sec. 600.315).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> MSY for stock complexes. MSY should be estimated on a stock-by-stock basis whenever possible. However, where MSY cannot be estimated for each stock in a stock complex, then MSY may be estimated for one or more indicator stocks for the complex or for the complex as a whole. When indicator stocks are used, the stock complex's MSY could be listed as ``unknown,'' while noting that the complex is managed on the basis of one or more indicator stocks that do have known stock-specific MSYs, or suitable proxies, as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section. When indicator stocks are not used, MSY, or a suitable proxy, should be calculated for the stock complex as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specifying MSY. Because MSY is a long-term average, it need not be estimated annually, but it must be based on the best scientific information available (see Sec. 600.315), and should be re-estimated as required by changes in long-term environmental or ecological conditions, fishery technological characteristics, or new scientific information. When data are insufficient to estimate MSY directly, Councils should adopt other measures of reproductive potential, based on the best scientific information available, that can serve as reasonable proxies for MSY, Fmsy, and Bmsy, to the extent possible. The MSY for a stock is influenced by its interactions with other stocks in its ecosystem and these interactions may shift as multiple stocks in an ecosystem are fished. These ecological conditions should be taken into account, to the extent possible, when specifying MSY. Ecological conditions not directly accounted for in the specification of MSY can be among the ecological factors considered when setting OY below MSY. As MSY values are estimates or are based on proxies, they will have some level of uncertainty associated with them. The degree of uncertainty in the estimates should be identified, when possible, through the stock assessment process and peer review (see Sec. 600.335), and should be taken into account when specifying the ABC Control rule. Where this uncertainty cannot be directly calculated, such as when proxies are used, then a proxy for the uncertainty itself should be established based on the best scientific information, including comparison to other stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Status determination criteria--(i) Definitions. (A) Status determination criteria (SDC) mean the quantifiable factors, MFMT, OFL, and MSST, or their proxies, that are used to determine if overfishing has occurred, or if the stock or stock complex is overfished. Magnuson-Stevens Act (section 3(34)) defines both ``overfishing'' and ``overfished'' to mean a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a fishery to produce the MSY on a continuing basis. To avoid confusion, this section clarifies that ``overfished'' relates to biomass of a stock or stock complex, and ``overfishing'' pertains to a rate or level of removal of fish from a stock or stock complex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions.

To avoid confusion, this section clarifies that ``overfished'' relates to biomass of a stock or stock complex, and ``overfishing'' pertains to a rate or level of removal of fish from a stock or stock complex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Overfishing (to overfish) occurs whenever a stock or stock complex is subjected to a level of fishing mortality or annual total catch that jeopardizes the capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Maximum fishing mortality threshold (MFMT) means the level of fishing mortality (F), on an annual basis, above which overfishing is occurring. The MFMT or reasonable proxy may be expressed either as a single number (a fishing mortality rate or F value), or as a function of spawning biomass or other measure of reproductive potential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Overfishing limit (OFL) means the annual amount of catch that corresponds to the estimate of MFMT applied to a stock or stock complex's abundance and is expressed in terms of numbers or weight of fish. The OFL is an estimate of the catch level above which overfishing is occurring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Overfished. A stock or stock complex is considered ``overfished'' when

its biomass has declined below a level that jeopardizes the capacity of the stock or stock complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Minimum stock size threshold (MSST) means the level of biomass below which the stock or stock complex is considered to be overfished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Approaching an overfished condition. A stock or stock complex is approaching an overfished condition when it is projected that there is more than a 50 percent chance that the biomass of the stock or stock complex will decline below the MSST within two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specification of SDC and overfishing and overfished determinations. SDC must be expressed in a way that enables the Council to monitor each stock or stock complex in the FMP, and determine annually, if possible, whether overfishing is occurring and whether the stock or stock complex is overfished. In specifying SDC, a Council must provide an analysis of how the SDC were chosen and how they relate to reproductive potential. Each FMP must specify, to the extent possible, objective and measurable SDC as follows (see paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> SDC to determine overfishing status. Each FMP must describe which of the following two methods will be used for each stock or stock complex to determine an overfishing status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fishing mortality rate exceeds MFMT. Exceeding the MFMT for a period of 1 year or more constitutes overfishing. The MFMT or reasonable proxy may be expressed either as a single number (a fishing mortality rate or F value), or as a function of spawning biomass or other measure of reproductive potential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Catch exceeds the OFL. Should the annual catch exceed the annual OFL for 1 year or more, the stock or stock complex is considered subject to overfishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> SDC to determine overfished status. The MSST or reasonable proxy must be expressed in terms of spawning biomass or other measure of reproductive potential. To the extent possible, the MSST should equal whichever of the following is greater: One-half the MSY stock size, or the minimum stock size at which rebuilding to the MSY level would be expected to occur within 10 years, if the stock or stock complex were exploited at the MFMT specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section. Should the estimated size of the stock or stock complex in a given year fall below this threshold, the stock or stock complex is considered overfished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Relationship of SDC to environmental change. Some short-term environmental changes can alter the size of a stock or stock complex without affecting its long-term reproductive potential. Long-term environmental changes affect both the short-term size of the stock or stock complex and the long-term reproductive potential of the stock or stock complex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If environmental changes cause a stock or stock complex to fall below its MSST without affecting its long-term reproductive potential, fishing mortality must be constrained sufficiently to allow rebuilding within an acceptable time frame (also see paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section). SDC should not be respecified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If environmental changes affect the long-term reproductive potential of the stock or stock complex, one or more components of the SDC must be respecified. Once SDC have been respecified, fishing mortality may or may not have to be reduced, depending on the status of the stock or stock complex with respect to the new criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If manmade environmental changes are partially responsible for a stock or stock complex being in an overfished condition, in addition to controlling fishing mortality, Councils should recommend restoration of habitat and other ameliorative programs, to the extent possible (see also the guidelines issued pursuant to section 305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act for Council actions concerning essential fish habitat).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Secretarial approval of SDC. Secretarial approval or disapproval of proposed SDC will be based on consideration of whether the proposal:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has sufficient scientific merit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contains the elements described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Provides a basis for objective measurement of the status of the stock or stock complex against the criteria; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Is operationally feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optimum yield--(i) Definitions--(A) Optimum yield (OY). Magnuson-Stevens Act section (3)(33) defines ``optimum,'' with respect to the yield from a fishery, as the amount of fish that will provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with respect to food production and recreational opportunities and taking into account the protection of marine ecosystems; that is prescribed on the basis of the MSY from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, social, or ecological factor; and, in the case of an overfished fishery, that provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing the MSY in such fishery. OY may be established at the stock or stock complex level, or at the fishery level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions--(A) Optimum yield (OY). Magnuson-Stevens Act section (3)(33) defines ``optimum,'' with respect to the yield from a fishery, as the amount of fish that will provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with respect to food production and recreational opportunities and taking into account the protection of marine ecosystems; that is prescribed on the basis of the MSY from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, social, or ecological factor; and, in the case of an overfished fishery, that provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing the MSY in such fishery.

OY may be established at the stock or stock complex level, or at the fishery level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In NS1, use of the phrase ``achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery'' means producing, from each stock, stock complex, or fishery: a long-term series of catches such that the average catch is equal to the OY, overfishing is prevented, the long term average biomass is near or above Bmsy, and overfished stocks and stock complexes are rebuilt consistent with timing and other requirements of section 304(e)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General. OY is a long-term average amount of desired yield from a stock, stock complex, or fishery. An FMP must contain conservation and management measures, including ACLs and AMs, to achieve OY on a continuing basis, and provisions for information collection that are designed to determine the degree to which OY is achieved. These measures should allow for practical and effective implementation and enforcement of the management regime. The Secretary has an obligation to implement and enforce the FMP. If management measures prove unenforceable--or too restrictive, or not rigorous enough to prevent overfishing while achieving OY--they should be modified; an alternative is to reexamine the adequacy of the OY specification. Exceeding OY does not necessarily constitute overfishing. However, even if no overfishing resulted from exceeding OY, continual harvest at a level above OY would violate NS1, because OY was not achieved on a continuing basis. An FMP must contain an assessment and specification of OY, including a summary of information utilized in making such specification, consistent with requirements of section 303(a)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. A Council must identify those economic, social, and ecological factors relevant to management of a particular stock, stock complex, or fishery, and then evaluate them to determine the OY. The choice of a particular OY must be carefully documented to show that the OY selected will produce the greatest benefit to the Nation and prevent overfishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determining the greatest benefit to the Nation. In determining the greatest benefit to the Nation, the values that should be weighed and receive serious attention when considering the economic, social, or ecological factors used in reducing MSY to obtain OY are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The benefits of food production are derived from providing seafood to consumers; maintaining an economically viable fishery together with its attendant contributions to the national, regional, and local economies; and utilizing the capacity of the Nation's fishery resources to meet nutritional needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The benefits of recreational opportunities reflect the quality of both the recreational fishing experience and non-consumptive fishery uses such as ecotourism, fish watching, and recreational diving. Benefits also include the contribution of recreational fishing to the national, regional, and local economies and food supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The benefits of protection afforded to marine ecosystems are those resulting from maintaining viable populations (including those of unexploited species), maintaining adequate forage for all components of the ecosystem, maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes (e.g., disturbance regimes, hydrological processes,

nutrient cycles), maintaining the evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems, and accommodating human use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Factors to consider in OY specification. Because fisheries have limited capacities, any attempt to maximize the measures of benefits described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section will inevitably encounter practical constraints. OY cannot exceed MSY in any circumstance, and must take into account the need to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks and stock complexes. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY as reduced by social, economic, and ecological factors. To the extent possible, the relevant social, economic, and ecological factors used to establish OY for a stock, stock complex, or fishery should be quantified and reviewed in historical, short-term, and long-term contexts. Even where quantification of social, economic, and ecological factors is not possible, the FMP still must address them in its OY specification. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential considerations for each factor. An FMP must address each factor but not necessarily each example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Social factors. Examples are enjoyment gained from recreational fishing, avoidance of gear conflicts and resulting disputes, preservation of a way of life for fishermen and their families, and dependence of local communities on a fishery (e.g., involvement in fisheries and ability to adapt to change). Consideration may be given to fishery-related indicators (e.g., number of fishery permits, number of commercial fishing vessels, number of party and charter trips, landings, ex-vessel revenues etc.) and non-fishery related indicators (e.g., unemployment rates, percent of population below the poverty level, population density, etc.). Other factors that may be considered include the effects that past harvest levels have had on fishing communities, the cultural place of subsistence fishing, obligations under Indian treaties, proportions of affected minority and low-income groups, and worldwide nutritional needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Economic factors. Examples are prudent consideration of the risk of overharvesting when a stock's size or reproductive potential is uncertain (see Sec. 600.335(c)(2)(i)), satisfaction of consumer and recreational needs, and encouragement of domestic and export markets for U.S. harvested fish. Other factors that may be considered include: The value of fisheries, the level of capitalization, the decrease in cost per unit of catch afforded by an increase in stock size, the attendant increase in catch per unit of effort, alternate employment opportunities, and economic contribution to fishing communities, coastal areas, affected states, and the nation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Ecological factors. Examples include impacts on ecosystem component species, forage fish stocks, other fisheries, predator-prey or competitive interactions, marine mammals, threatened or endangered species, and birds. Species interactions that have not been explicitly taken into account when calculating MSY should be considered as relevant factors for setting OY below MSY. In addition, consideration should be given to managing forage stocks for higher biomass than Bmsy to enhance and protect the marine ecosystem. Also important are ecological or environmental conditions that stress marine organisms, such as natural and manmade changes in wetlands or nursery grounds, and effects of pollutants on habitat and stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Specification of OY. The specification of OY must be consistent with paragraphs (e)(3)(i)-(iv) of this section. If the estimates of MFMT and current biomass are known with a high level of certainty and management controls can accurately limit catch then OY could be set very close to MSY, assuming no other reductions are necessary for social, economic, or ecological factors. To the degree that such MSY estimates and management controls are lacking or unavailable, OY should be set farther from MSY. If management measures cannot adequately control fishing mortality so that the specified OY can be achieved without overfishing, the Council should reevaluate the management measures and specification of OY so that the dual requirements of NS1 (preventing overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, OY) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of fish that constitutes the OY should be expressed in terms of numbers or weight of fish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Either a range or a single value may be specified for OY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All catch must be counted against OY, including that resulting from bycatch, scientific research, and all fishing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The OY specification should be translatable into an annual numerical estimate for the purposes of establishing any total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF) and analyzing impacts of the management regime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The determination of OY is based on MSY, directly or through proxy. However, even where sufficient scientific data as to the biological characteristics of the stock do not exist, or where the period of exploitation or investigation has not been long enough for adequate understanding of stock dynamics, or where frequent large-scale fluctuations in stock size diminish the meaningfulness of the MSY concept, OY must still be established based on the best scientific information available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> An OY established at a fishery level may not exceed the sum of the MSY values for each of the stocks or stock complexes within the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> There should be a mechanism in the FMP for periodic reassessment of the OY specification, so that it is responsive to changing circumstances in the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Part of the OY may be held as a reserve to allow for factors such as uncertainties in estimates of stock size and domestic annual harvest (DAH). If an OY reserve is established, an adequate mechanism should be included in the FMP to permit timely release of the reserve to domestic or foreign fishermen, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> OY and foreign fishing. Section 201(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act provides that fishing by foreign nations is limited to that portion of the OY that will not be harvested by vessels of the United States. The FMP must include an assessment to address the following, as required by section 303(a)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DAH. Councils and/or the Secretary must consider the capacity of, and the extent to which, U.S. vessels will harvest the OY on an annual basis. Estimating the amount that U.S. fishing vessels will actually harvest is required to determine the surplus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Domestic annual processing (DAP). Each FMP must assess the capacity of U.S. processors. It must also assess the amount of DAP, which is the sum of two estimates: The estimated amount of U.S. harvest that domestic processors will process, which may be based on historical performance or on surveys of the expressed intention of manufacturers to process, supported by evidence of contracts, plant expansion, or other relevant information; and the estimated amount of fish that will be harvested by domestic vessels, but not processed (e.g., marketed as fresh whole fish, used for private consumption, or used for bait).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Joint venture processing (JVP). When DAH exceeds DAP, the surplus is available for JVP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Acceptable biological catch, annual catch limits, and annual catch targets. The following features (see paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section) of acceptable biological catch and annual catch limits apply to stocks and stock complexes in the fishery (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. A control rule is a policy for establishing a limit or target fishing level that is based on the best available scientific information and is established by fishery managers in consultation with fisheries scientists. Control rules should be designed so that management actions become more conservative as biomass estimates, or other proxies, for a stock or stock complex decline and as science and management uncertainty increases. Examples of scientific uncertainty include uncertainty in the estimates of MFMT and biomass. Management uncertainty may include late catch reporting, misreporting, and underreporting of catches and is affected by a fishery's ability to control actual catch. For example, a fishery that has inseason catch data available and inseason closure authority has better management control and precision than a fishery that does not have these features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. (i) Catch is the total quantity of fish, measured in weight or numbers of fish, taken in commercial,

recreational, subsistence, tribal, and other fisheries. Catch includes fish that are retained for any purpose, as well as mortality of fish that are discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catch is the total quantity of fish, measured in weight or numbers of fish, taken in commercial,

recreational, subsistence, tribal, and other fisheries. Catch includes fish that are retained for any purpose, as well as mortality of fish that are discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acceptable biological catch (ABC) is a level of a stock or stock complex's annual catch that accounts for the scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other scientific uncertainty (see paragraph (f)(3) of this section), and should be specified based on the ABC control rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ABC control rule means a specified approach to setting the ABC for a stock or stock complex as a function of the scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other scientific uncertainty (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Annual catch limit (ACL) is the level of annual catch of a stock or stock complex that serves as the basis for invoking AMs. ACL cannot exceed the ABC, but may be divided into sector-ACLs (see paragraph (f)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Annual catch target (ACT) is an amount of annual catch of a stock or stock complex that is the management target of the fishery, and accounts for management uncertainty in controlling the actual catch at or below the ACL. ACTs are recommended in the system of accountability measures so that ACL is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> ACT control rule means a specified approach to setting the ACT for a stock or stock complex such that the risk of exceeding the ACL due to management uncertainty is at an acceptably low level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specification of ABC. ABC may not exceed OFL (see paragraph (e)(2)(i)(D) of this section). Councils should develop a process for receiving scientific information and advice used to establish ABC. This process should: Identify the body that will apply the ABC control rule (i.e. , calculates the ABC), and identify the review process that will evaluate the resulting ABC. The SSC must recommend the ABC to the Council. An SSC may recommend an ABC that differs from the result of the ABC control rule calculation, based on factors such as data uncertainty, recruitment variability, declining trends in population variables, and other factors, but must explain why. For Secretarial FMPs or FMP amendments, agency scientists or a peer review process would provide the scientific advice to establish ABC. For internationally-assessed stocks, an ABC as defined in these guidelines is not required if they meet the international exception (see paragraph (h)(2)(ii)). While the ABC is allowed to equal OFL, NMFS expects that in most cases ABC will be reduced from OFL to reduce the probability that overfishing might occur in a year. Also, see paragraph (f)(5) of this section for cases where a Council recommends that ACL is equal to ABC, and ABC is equal to OFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Expression of ABC. ABC should be expressed in terms of catch, but may be expressed in terms of landings as long as estimates of bycatch and any other fishing mortality not accounted for in the landings are incorporated into the determination of ABC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ABC for overfished stocks. For overfished stocks and stock complexes, a rebuilding ABC must be set to reflect the annual catch that is consistent with the schedule of fishing mortality rates in the rebuilding plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ABC control rule. For stocks and stock complexes required to have an ABC, each Council must establish an ABC control rule based on scientific advice from its SSC. The determination of ABC should be based, when possible, on the probability that an actual catch equal to the stock's ABC would result in overfishing. This probability that overfishing will occur cannot exceed 50 percent and should be a lower value. The ABC control rule should consider reducing fishing mortality as stock size declines and may establish a stock abundance level below which fishing would not be allowed. The process of establishing an ABC control rule could also involve science advisors or the peer review process established under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(E). The ABC control rule must articulate how ABC will be set compared to the OFL based on the scientific knowledge about the stock or stock complex and the scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other scientific uncertainty. The ABC

control rule should consider uncertainty in factors such as stock assessment results, time lags in updating assessments, the degree of retrospective revision of assessment results, and projections. The control rule may be used in a tiered approach to address different levels of scientific uncertainty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Setting the annual catch limit--(i) General. ACL cannot exceed the ABC and may be set annually or on a multiyear plan basis. ACLs in coordination with AMs must prevent overfishing (see MSA section 303(a)(15)). If a Council recommends an ACL which equals ABC, and the ABC is equal to OFL, the Secretary may presume that the proposal would not prevent overfishing, in the absence of sufficient analysis and justification for the approach. A ``multiyear plan'' as referenced in section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is a plan that establishes harvest specifications or harvest guidelines for each year of a time period greater than 1 year. A multiyear plan must include a mechanism for specifying ACLs for each year with appropriate AMs to prevent overfishing and maintain an appropriate rate of rebuilding if the stock or stock complex is in a rebuilding plan. A multiyear plan must provide that, if an ACL is exceeded for a year, then AMs are triggered for the next year consistent with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. ACL cannot exceed the ABC and may be set annually or on a multiyear plan basis. ACLs in coordination with AMs must prevent overfishing (see MSA section 303(a)(15)). If a Council recommends an ACL which equals ABC, and the ABC is equal to OFL, the Secretary may presume that the proposal would not prevent overfishing, in the absence of sufficient analysis and justification for the approach. A ``multiyear plan'' as referenced in section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is a plan that establishes harvest specifications or harvest guidelines for each year of a time period greater than 1 year. A multiyear plan must include a mechanism for specifying ACLs for each year with appropriate AMs to prevent overfishing and maintain an appropriate rate of rebuilding if the stock or stock complex is in a rebuilding plan. A multiyear plan must provide that, if an ACL is exceeded for a year, then AMs are triggered for the next year consistent with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sector-ACLs. A Council may, but is not required to, divide an ACL into sector-ACLs. ``Sector,'' for purposes of this section, means a distinct user group to which separate management strategies and separate catch quotas apply. Examples of sectors include the commercial sector, recreational sector, or various gear groups within a fishery. If the management measures for different sectors differ in the degree of management uncertainty, then sector ACLs may be necessary so that appropriate AMs can be developed for each sector. If a Council chooses to use sector ACLs, the sum of sector ACLs must not exceed the stock or stock complex level ACL. The system of ACLs and AMs designed must be effective in protecting the stock or stock complex as a whole. Even if sector-ACLs and AMs are established, additional AMs at the stock or stock complex level may be necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ACLs for State-Federal Fisheries. For stocks or stock complexes that have harvest in state or territorial waters, FMPs and FMP amendments should include an ACL for the overall stock that may be further divided. For example, the overall ACL could be divided into a Federal-ACL and state-ACL. However, NMFS recognizes that Federal management is limited to the portion of the fishery under Federal authority (see paragraph (g)(5) of this section). When stocks are co-managed by Federal, state, tribal, and/or territorial fishery managers, the goal should be to develop collaborative conservation and management strategies, and scientific capacity to support such strategies (including AMs for state or territorial and Federal waters), to prevent overfishing of shared stocks and ensure their sustainability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> ACT control rule. If ACT is specified as part of the AMs for a fishery, an ACT control rule is utilized for setting the ACT. The ACT control rule should clearly articulate how management uncertainty in the amount of catch in the fishery is accounted for in setting ACT. The objective for establishing the ACT and related AMs is that the ACL not be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining management uncertainty. Two sources of management uncertainty should be accounted for in establishing the AMs for a fishery, including the ACT control rule if utilized: Uncertainty in the ability of managers to constrain catch so the ACL is not exceeded, and uncertainty in quantifying the true catch amounts (i.e., estimation errors). To determine the level of management uncertainty in controlling catch, analyses need to consider past management performance in the fishery and factors such as time lags in reported catch. Such analyses must be based on the best available scientific information from an SSC, agency scientists, or peer review process as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing tiers and corresponding ACT control rules. Tiers can be established based on levels of management uncertainty associated with the fishery, frequency and accuracy of catch monitoring data available, and risks of

exceeding the limit. An ACT control rule could be established for each tier and have, as appropriate, different formulas and standards used to establish the ACT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A Council may choose to use a single control rule that combines both scientific and management uncertainty and supports the ABC recommendation and establishment of ACL and if used ACT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Accountability measures. The following features (see paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section) of accountability measures apply to those stocks and stock complexes in the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. AMs are management controls to prevent ACLs, including sector-ACLs, from being exceeded, and to correct or mitigate overages of the ACL if they occur. AMs should address and minimize both the frequency and magnitude of overages and correct the problems that caused the overage in as short a time as possible. NMFS identifies two categories of AMs, inseason AMs and AMs for when the ACL is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inseason AMs. Whenever possible, FMPs should include inseason monitoring and management measures to prevent catch from exceeding ACLs. Inseason AMs could include, but are not limited to: ACT; closure of a fishery; closure of specific areas; changes in gear; changes in trip size or bag limits; reductions in effort; or other appropriate management controls for the fishery. If final data or data components of catch are delayed, Councils should make appropriate use of preliminary data, such as landed catch, in implementing inseason AMs. FMPs should contain inseason closure authority giving NMFS the ability to close fisheries if it determines, based on data that it deems sufficiently reliable, that an ACL has been exceeded or is projected to be reached, and that closure of the fishery is necessary to prevent overfishing. For fisheries without inseason management control to prevent the ACL from being exceeded, AMs should utilize ACTs that are set below ACLs so that catches do not exceed the ACL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> AMs for when the ACL is exceeded. On an annual basis, the Council must determine as soon as possible after the fishing year if an ACL was exceeded. If an ACL was exceeded, AMs must be triggered and implemented as soon as possible to correct the operational issue that caused the ACL overage, as well as any biological consequences to the stock or stock complex resulting from the overage when it is known. These AMs could include, among other things, modifications of inseason AMs or overage adjustments. For stocks and stock complexes in rebuilding plans, the AMs should include overage adjustments that reduce the ACLs in the next fishing year by the full amount of the overages, unless the best scientific information available shows that a reduced overage adjustment, or no adjustment, is needed to mitigate the effects of the overages. If catch exceeds the ACL for a given stock or stock complex more than once in the last four years, the system of ACLs and AMs should be re-evaluated, and modified if necessary, to improve its performance and effectiveness. A Council could choose a higher performance standard (e.g., a stock's catch should not exceed its ACL more often than once every five or six years) for a stock that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of overfishing, if the vulnerability of the stock has not already been accounted for in the ABC control rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> AMs based on multi-year average data. Some fisheries have highly variable annual catches and lack reliable inseason or annual data on which to base AMs. If there are insufficient data upon which to compare catch to ACL, either inseason or on an annual basis, AMs could be based on comparisons of average catch to average ACL over a three-year moving average period or, if supported by analysis, some other appropriate multi-year period. Councils should explain why basing AMs on a multi-year period is appropriate. Evaluation of the moving average catch to the average ACL must be conducted annually and AMs should be implemented if the average catch exceeds the average ACL. As a performance standard, if the average catch exceeds the average ACL for a stock or stock complex more than once in the last four years, then the system of ACLs and AMs should be re-evaluated and

modified if necessary to improve its performance and effectiveness. The initial ACL and management measures may incorporate information from previous years so that AMs based on average ACLs can be applied from the first year. Alternatively, a Council could use a stepped approach where in year-1, catch is compared to the ACL for year-1; in year-2 the average catch for the past 2 years is compared to the average ACL; then in year 3 and beyond, the most recent 3 years of catch are compared to the corresponding ACLs for those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> AMs for State-Federal Fisheries. For stocks or stock complexes that have harvest in state or territorial waters, FMPs and FMP amendments must, at a minimum, have AMs for the portion of the fishery under Federal authority. Such AMs could include closing the EEZ when the Federal portion of the ACL is reached, or the overall stock's ACL is reached, or other measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Establishing ACL mechanisms and AMs in FMPs. FMPs or FMP amendments must establish ACL mechanisms and AMs for all stocks and stock complexes in the fishery, unless paragraph (h)(2) of this section is applicable. These mechanisms should describe the annual or multiyear process by which specific ACLs, AMs, and other reference points such as OFL, and ABC will be established. If a complex has multiple indicator stocks, each indicator stock must have its own ACL; an additional ACL for the stock complex as a whole is optional. In cases where fisheries (e.g., Pacific salmon) harvest multiple indicator stocks of a single species that cannot be distinguished at the time of capture, separate ACLs for the indicator stocks are not required and the ACL can be established for the complex as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In establishing ACL mechanisms and AMs, FMPs should describe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Timeframes for setting ACLs (e.g., annually or multi-year periods);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sector-ACLs, if any (including set-asides for research or bycatch);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> AMs and how AMs are triggered and what sources of data will be used (e.g., inseason data, annual catch compared to the ACL, or multi-year averaging approach); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sector-AMs, if there are sector-ACLs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions from ACL and AM requirements--(i) Life cycle. Section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act ``shall not apply to a fishery for species that has a life cycle of approximately 1 year unless the Secretary has determined the fishery is subject to overfishing of that species'' (as described in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). This exception applies to a stock for which the average length of time it takes for an individual to produce a reproductively active offspring is approximately 1 year and that the individual has only one breeding season in its lifetime. While exempt from the ACL and AM requirements, FMPs or FMP amendments for these stocks must have SDC, MSY, OY, ABC, and an ABC control rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Life cycle. Section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act ``shall not apply to a fishery for species that has a life cycle of approximately 1 year unless the Secretary has determined the fishery is subject to overfishing of that species'' (as described in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). This exception applies to a stock for which the average length of time it takes for an individual to produce a reproductively active offspring is approximately 1 year and that the individual has only one breeding season in its lifetime. While exempt from the ACL and AM requirements, FMPs or FMP amendments for these stocks must have SDC, MSY, OY, ABC, and an ABC control rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> International fishery agreements. Section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act applies ``unless otherwise provided for under an international agreement in which the United States participates'' (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). This exception applies to stocks or stock complexes subject to management under an international agreement, which is defined as ``any bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, or agreement which relates to fishing and to which the United States is a party'' (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(24)). These stocks would still need to have SDC and MSY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flexibility in application of NS1 guidelines. There are limited circumstances that may not fit the standard approaches to specification of reference points and management measures set forth in these guidelines. These include, among other things, conservation and management of Endangered Species Act listed species, harvests from aquaculture operations, and stocks with unusual life history characteristics (e.g., Pacific salmon, where the spawning potential for a stock is spread over a multi-year period). In these circumstances, Councils may propose alternative approaches for satisfying the NS1 requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act than those set forth in these guidelines. Councils must document their rationale for any

alternative approaches for these limited circumstances in an FMP or FMP amendment, which will be reviewed for consistency with the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fisheries data. In their FMPs, or associated public documents such as SAFE reports as appropriate, Councils must describe general data collection methods, as well as any specific data collection methods used for all stocks in the fishery, and EC species, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sources of fishing mortality (both landed and discarded), including commercial and recreational catch and bycatch in other fisheries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of the data collection and estimation methods used to quantify total catch mortality in each fishery, including information on the management tools used (i.e., logbooks, vessel monitoring systems, observer programs, landings reports, fish tickets, processor reports, dealer reports, recreational angler surveys, or other methods); the frequency with which data are collected and updated; and the scope of sampling coverage for each fishery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Description of the methods used to compile catch data from various catch data collection methods and how those data are used to determine the relationship between total catch at a given point in time and the ACL for stocks and stock complexes that are part of a fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Council actions to address overfishing and rebuilding for stocks and stock complexes in the fishery--(1) Notification.

(i) Where a stock or stock complex is overfished, a Council must specify a time period for rebuilding the stock or stock complex based on factors specified in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(e)(4). This target time for rebuilding (Ttarget) shall be as short as possible, taking into account: The status and biology of any overfished stock, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the U.S. participates, and interaction of the stock within the marine ecosystem. In addition, the time period shall not exceed 10 years, except where biology of the stock, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement to which the U.S. participates, dictate otherwise. SSCs (or agency scientists or peer review processes in the case of Secretarial actions) shall provide recommendations for achieving rebuilding targets (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(B)). The above factors enter into the specification of Ttarget as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where a stock or stock complex is overfished, a Council must specify a time period for rebuilding the stock or stock complex based on factors specified in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(e)(4).

SSCs (or agency scientists or peer review processes in the case of Secretarial actions) shall provide recommendations for achieving rebuilding targets (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(B)). The above factors enter into the specification of Ttarget as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The ``minimum time for rebuilding a stock'' (Tmin) means the amount of time the stock or stock complex is expected to take to rebuild to its MSY biomass level in the absence of any fishing mortality. In this context, the term ``expected'' means to have at least a 50 percent probability of attaining the Bmsy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For scenarios under paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the starting year for the Tmin calculation is the first year that a rebuilding plan is implemented. For scenarios under paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the starting year for the Tmin calculation is 2 years after notification that a stock or stock complex is overfished or the first year that a rebuilding plan is implemented, whichever is sooner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If Tmin for the stock or stock complex is 10 years or less, then the maximum time allowable for rebuilding (Tmax) that stock to its Bmsy is 10 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If Tmin for the stock or stock complex exceeds 10 years, then the maximum time allowable for rebuilding a stock or stock complex to its Bmsy is Tmin plus the length of time associated with one generation time for that stock or stock complex. ``Generation time'' is the average length of time between when an individual is born and the birth of its offspring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Ttarget shall not exceed Tmax, and should be calculated based on the factors described in this paragraph (j)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a stock or stock complex reached the end of its rebuilding plan period and has not yet been determined to be rebuilt, then the rebuilding F should not be increased until the stock or stock complex has been demonstrated to be rebuilt. If the rebuilding plan was based on a Ttarget that was less than Tmax, and the stock or stock complex is not rebuilt by Ttarget, rebuilding measures should be revised, if necessary, such that the stock or stock complex will be rebuilt by Tmax. If the stock or stock complex has not rebuilt by Tmax, then the fishing mortality rate should be maintained at Frebuild or 75 percent of the MFMT, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Council action addressing an overfished fishery must allocate both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For fisheries managed under an international agreement, Council action addressing an overfished fishery must reflect traditional participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Emergency actions and interim measures. The Secretary, on his/her own initiative or in response to a Council request, may implement interim measures to reduce overfishing or promulgate regulations to address an emergency (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(e)(6) or 305(c)). In considering a Council request for action, the Secretary would consider, among other

things, the need for and urgency of the action and public interest considerations, such as benefits to the stock or stock complex and impacts on participants in the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> These measures may remain in effect for not more than 180 days, but may be extended for an additional 186 days if the public has had an opportunity to comment on the measures and, in the case of Council-recommended measures, the Council is actively preparing an FMP, FMP amendment, or proposed regulations to address the emergency or overfishing on a permanent basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Often, these measures need to be implemented without prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, as it would be impracticable to provide for such processes given the need to act quickly and also contrary to the public interest to delay action. However, emergency regulations and interim measures that do not qualify for waivers or exceptions under the Administrative Procedure Act would need to follow proposed notice and comment rulemaking procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> International overfishing. If the Secretary determines that a fishery is overfished or approaching a condition of being overfished due to excessive international fishing pressure, and for which there are no management measures (or no effective measures) to end overfishing under an international agreement to which the United States is a party, then the Secretary and/or the appropriate Council shall take certain actions as provided under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(i). The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, must immediately take appropriate action at the international level to end the overfishing. In addition, within one year after the determination, the Secretary and/or appropriate Council shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Develop recommendations for domestic regulations to address the relative impact of the U.S. fishing vessels on the stock. Council recommendations should be submitted to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Develop and submit recommendations to the Secretary of State, and to the Congress, for international actions that will end overfishing in the fishery and rebuild the affected stocks, taking into account the relative impact of vessels of other nations and vessels of the United States on the relevant stock. Councils should, in consultation with the Secretary, develop recommendations that take into consideration relevant provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and NS1 guidelines, including section 304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and paragraph (j)(3)(iv) of this section, and other applicable laws. For highly migratory species in the Pacific, recommendations from the Western Pacific, North Pacific, or Pacific Councils must be developed and submitted consistent with Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act section 503(f), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Considerations for assessing ``relative impact.'' ``Relative impact'' under paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section may include consideration of factors that include, but are not limited to: Domestic and international management measures already in place, management history of a given nation, estimates of a nation's landings or catch (including bycatch) in a given fishery, and estimates of a nation's mortality contributions in a given fishery. Information used to determine relative impact must be based upon the best available scientific information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Relationship of National Standard 1 to other national standards--General. National Standards 2 through 10 provide further requirements for conservation and management measures in FMPs, but do not alter the requirement of NS1 to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> National Standard 2 (see Sec. 600.315). Management measures and reference points to implement NS1 must be based on the best scientific information available. When data are insufficient to estimate reference points directly, Councils should develop reasonable proxies to the extent possible (also see paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section). In cases where scientific data are severely limited, effort should also be directed to identifying and gathering the needed data. SSCs should advise their Councils regarding the best scientific information available for fishery management decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> National Standard 3 (see Sec. 600.320). Reference points should generally be

specified in terms of the level of stock aggregation for which the best scientific information is available (also see paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section). Also, scientific assessments must be based on the best information about the total range of the stock and potential biological structuring of the stock into biological sub-units, which may differ from the geographic units on which management is feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> National Standard 6 (see Sec. 600.335). Councils must build into the reference points and control rules appropriate consideration of risk, taking into account uncertainties in estimating harvest, stock conditions, life history parameters, or the effects of environmental factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> National Standard 8 (see Sec. 600.345). National Standard 8 directs the Councils to apply economic and social factors towards sustained participation of fishing communities and to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities within the context of preventing overfishing and rebuilding overfished stocks as required under National Standard 1. Therefore, calculation of OY as reduced from MSY should include economic and social factors, but the combination of management measures chosen to achieve the OY must principally be designed to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> National Standard 9 (see Sec. 600.350). Evaluation of stock status with respect to reference points must take into account mortality caused by bycatch. In addition, the estimation of catch should include the mortality of fish that are discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Exceptions to requirements to prevent overfishing. Exceptions to the requirement to prevent overfishing could apply under certain limited circumstances. Harvesting one stock at its optimum level may result in overfishing of another stock when the two stocks tend to be caught together (This can occur when the two stocks are part of the same fishery or if one is bycatch in the other's fishery). Before a Council may decide to allow this type of overfishing, an analysis must be performed and the analysis must contain a justification in terms of overall benefits, including a comparison of benefits under alternative management measures, and an analysis of the risk of any stock or stock complex falling below its MSST. The Council may decide to allow this type of overfishing if the fishery is not overfished and the analysis demonstrates that all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such action will result in long-term net benefits to the Nation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mitigating measures have been considered and it has been demonstrated that a similar level of long-term net benefits cannot be achieved by modifying fleet behavior, gear selection/configuration, or other technical characteristic in a manner such that no overfishing would occur; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The resulting rate of fishing mortality will not cause any stock or stock complex to fall below its MSST more than 50 percent of the time in the long term, although it is recognized that persistent overfishing is expected to cause the affected stock to fall below its Bmsy more than 50 percent of the time in the long term.
