Coke oven batteries in operation as of April 1, 1992, are identified in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Certified observer means a visual emission observer, certified under (if applicable) Method 303 and Method 9 (if applicable) and employed by the Administrator, which includes a delegated enforcement agency or its designated agent. For the purpose of notifying an owner or operator of the results obtained by a certified observer, the person does not have to be certified.</p><p class="depth0">Charge or charging period means, for a by-product coke oven battery, the period of time that commences when coal begins to flow into an oven through a topside port and ends when the last charging port is recapped. For a nonrecovery coke oven battery, charge or charging period means the period of time that commences when coal begins to flow into an oven and ends when the push side door is replaced.</p><p class="depth0">Coke oven battery means either a by-product or nonrecovery coke oven battery.</p><p class="depth0">Coke oven door means each end enclosure on the pusher side and the coking side of an oven. The chuck, or leveler-bar, door is part of the pusher side door. A coke oven door includes the entire area on the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the battery between two adjacent buckstays.</p><p class="depth0">Cold-idle coke oven battery means an existing coke oven battery that has been shut down, but is not dismantled.</p><p class="depth0">Collecting main means any apparatus that is connected to one or more offtake systems and that provides a passage for conveying gases under positive pressure from the by-product coke oven battery to the by-product recovery system.</p><p class="depth0">Collecting main repair means any measure to stop a collecting main leak on a long-term basis. A repair measure

in general is intended to restore the integrity of the collecting main by returning the main to approximately its design specifications or its condition before the leak occurred. A repair measure may include, but is not limited to, replacing a section of the collecting main or welding the source of the leak.</p><p class="depth0">Consecutive charges means charges observed successively, excluding any charge during which the observer's view of the charging system or topside ports is obscured.</p><p class="depth0">Design capacity means the original design capacity of a coke oven battery, expressed in megagrams per year of furnace coke.</p><p class="depth0">Foundry coke producer means a coke producer that is not and was not on January 1, 1992, owned or operated by an integrated steel producer and had on January 1, 1992, an annual design capacity of less than 1.25 million megagrams per year (1.38 million tons per year) (not including any capacity satisfying the requirements of Sec. 63.300(d)(2) or Sec. 63.304(b)(6)).</p><p class="depth0">Greenfield coke oven battery means a coke oven battery for which construction is commenced at a plant site (where no coke oven batteries previously existed) after December 4, 1992.</p><p class="depth0">Integrated steel producer means a company or corporation that produces coke, uses the coke in a blast furnace to make iron, and uses the iron to produce steel. These operations may be performed at different plant sites within the corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">New shed means a shed for which construction commenced after September 15, 1992. The shed at Bethlehem Steel Corporation's Bethlehem plant on Battery A is deemed not to be a new shed.</p><p class="depth0">Nonrecovery coke oven battery means a source consisting of a group of ovens connected by common walls and operated as a unit, where coal undergoes destructive distillation under negative pressure to produce coke, and which is designed for the combustion of the coke oven gas from which by-products are not recovered.</p><p class="depth0">Offtake system means any individual oven apparatus that is stationary and provides a passage for gases from an oven to a coke oven battery collecting main or to another oven. Offtake system components include the standpipe and standpipe caps, goosenecks, stationary jumper pipes, mini-standpipes, and standpipe and gooseneck connections.</p><p class="depth0">Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.</p><p class="depth0">Padup rebuild means a coke oven battery that is a complete reconstruction of an existing coke oven battery on the same site and pad without an increase in the design capacity of the coke plant as of November 15, 1990 (including any capacity qualifying under Sec. 63.304(b)(6), and the capacity of any coke oven battery subject to a construction permit on November 15, 1990, which commenced operation before October 27, 1993. The Administrator may determine that a project is a padup rebuild if it effectively constitutes a replacement of the battery above the pad, even if some portion of the brickwork above the pad is retained.</p><p class="depth0">Pushing, for the purposes of Sec. 63.305, means that coke oven operation that commences when the pushing ram starts into the oven to push out coke that has completed the coking cycle and ends when the quench car is clear of the coke side shed.</p><p class="depth0">Run means the observation of visible emissions from topside port lids, offtake systems, coke oven doors, or the charging of a coke oven that is made in accordance with and is valid under Methods 303 or 303A in appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth0">Shed means a structure for capturing coke oven emissions on the coke side or pusher side of the coke oven battery, which routes the emissions to a control device or system.</p><p class="depth0">Short coke oven battery means a coke oven battery with ovens less than 6 meters (20 feet) in height.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the operation that commences when pushing has occurred on the first oven with the intent of pushing the coke out of all of the ovens in a coke oven battery without adding coal, and ends when all of the ovens of a coke oven battery are empty of coal or coke.</p><p class="depth0">Standpipe cap means an apparatus used to cover the opening in the gooseneck of an offtake system.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means that operation that commences when the coal begins to be added to the first oven of a coke oven battery that either is being started for the first time or that is being restarted and ends when the doors have been adjusted for maximum leak reduction and the collecting main pressure control has been stabilized. Except for the first startup of a coke oven battery, a startup cannot occur unless a shutdown has occurred.</p><p class="depth0">Tall coke oven battery means a coke oven battery with ovens 6 meters (20 feet) or more in height.</p><p class="depth0">Temporary seal means any measure, including but not limited to, application of luting or packing material, to stop a collecting main leak until the leak is repaired.</p><p class="depth0">Topside port lid means a cover, removed during charging or decarbonizing, that is placed over the opening through which coal can be charged into the oven of a by-product coke oven battery.
