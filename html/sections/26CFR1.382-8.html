                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section provides rules to adjust the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group of corporations on a change date so that the same value is not included more than once in computing the limitations under section 382 for the loss corporations that are members of the controlled group. In general, the adjustment is made under paragraph (c) of this section by reducing the value of the loss corporation by the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group that the loss corporation owns immediately after the ownership change. The loss corporation's value may, however, be increased under paragraph (c) of this section by any amount of value that the other member elects to restore to the loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Controlled group loss and controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss--(1) In general. A controlled group loss is a pre-change loss (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of a loss corporation that is attributable to a taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group (as defined by paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section). The controlled group with respect to each controlled group loss is composed of the loss corporation and each other corporation that is a component member of a controlled group that includes the loss corporation both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Controlled group loss and controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss--(1) In general. A controlled group loss is a pre-change loss (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of a loss corporation that is attributable to a taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group (as defined by paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section). The controlled group with respect to each controlled group loss is composed of the loss corporation and each other corporation that is a component member of a controlled group that includes the loss corporation both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> With respect to the taxable year to which the controlled group loss is attributable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the taxable year to which the controlled group loss is attributable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> On the date the loss corporation has an ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the date the loss corporation has an ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Presumption regarding net unrealized built-in loss. For purposes of determining whether a net unrealized built-in loss of a loss corporation is attributable to a taxable year (the determination year) with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group, the built-in loss in a prior change date asset is deemed to be attributable to a period ending before the determination year. A prior change date asset is any asset held by the loss corporation at all times during the period beginning on the change date of its most recent ownership change after 1986 (the first change date), and ending on the first day of the determination year. The built-in loss in a prior change date asset is the amount by which the adjusted basis of the asset on the first change date exceeds the fair market value of the asset on that date. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) also apply to items described in section 382(h)(6)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of value. For purposes of computing the limitation under section 382 with respect to each controlled group loss, the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group with respect to that loss is determined immediately before the ownership change, and is adjusted by applying the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reduction in value. The value of the stock of each component member is reduced by the value (immediately before the ownership change and without regard to any restoration of value or other adjustment under this section) of the stock of any other component member directly owned by the component member immediately after the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restoration of value. After the value of the stock of each component member is reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the value of the stock of each component member is increased by the amount of value, if any, restored to the component member by another component member (the electing member) pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2). The electing member may elect (or may be deemed to elect under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the case of a foreign component member) to restore value to another component member in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The value, determined immediately before the ownership change, of the electing member's stock (after adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and before any restoration of value under this paragraph (c)(2)); plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any amount of value restored to the electing member by another component member under this paragraph (c)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value, determined immediately before any ownership change, of the electing member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under this section) that is directly owned by the other component member immediately after the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduction in value by the amount restored. The value of the stock of the electing member is reduced by any amount of value that the electing member elects to restore under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to another component member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appropriate adjustments. Appropriate additional adjustments consistent with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section must be made to prevent any duplication of value. Thus, for example, adjustments must be made to reflect--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any indirect ownership interest in another component member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any cross ownership of stock by component members of the controlled group with respect to the controlled group loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any value used to determine a limitation under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses from the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certain reductions in the value of members of a controlled group. A loss corporation that has an ownership change is required to make adjustments consistent with this paragraph (c) with respect to its stock if the stock of another corporation in which it had a direct or indirect ownership interest was disposed of before the ownership change, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Both corporations were component members of a controlled group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to a taxable year to which a controlled group loss of the loss corporation is attributable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At any time during the 2 year period before the ownership change; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Both corporations are component members of a controlled group at any time during the 2 year period following the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No double reduction. To the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, section 382 and this section shall not be applied to duplicate a reduction in the value of a loss corporation. Thus, for example, if the value of a loss corporation is reduced under section 382(l)(1) to reflect a capital contribution of stock of a component member, it is not again reduced by such amount under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If this paragraph (d) applies to prevent a reduction in value from being duplicated, the application of the other rules of this section, such as those relating to the restoration of value, is correspondingly limited in a manner consistent with the principles of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Definitions and nomenclature--(1) Definitions in section 382 and the regulations thereunder. Except as otherwise provided, the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definitions in section 382 and the regulations thereunder. Except as otherwise provided, the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Controlled group. Controlled group has the same meaning as in section 1563(a), determined by substituting ``50 percent'' for ``80 percent'' each place that it appears, and without regard to section 1563(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Component member. Component member has the same meaning as in section 1563(b), determined by substituting ``December 31 (or the change date, if earlier)'' for ``December 31'' each place it appears, and without regard to section 1563 (b)(2), (b)(3)(C), and (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign component member--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, foreign component member means a component member that is a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, foreign component member means a component member that is a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. A foreign component member shall not include a foreign corporation that has items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States that it takes into account in determining its value pursuant to section 382(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Predecessor and successor corporation. As the context may require, a reference to a corporation, or component member includes a reference to a predecessor or successor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Coordination between consolidated groups and controlled groups. Some or all of the component members of a controlled group may also be members of a

consolidated group, and a controlled group loss may be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation determined under Sec. 1.1502-93. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f) and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99, Sec. 1.1502-93 applies instead of this section when both sections, by their terms, are otherwise applicable. This section is applicable and may require an adjustment to value if a member of a consolidated group, a loss group, or loss subgroup (as those terms are defined in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-1(h) and 1.1502-91) is also a component member of a controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss. Solely for purposes of applying this section, a consolidated group, loss group, or loss subgroup is treated as a single corporation. Thus to determine the limitation with respect to any portion of the pre-change consolidated attributes or pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss group or loss subgroup that is a controlled group loss, the consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation is computed by treating the loss group or the loss subgroup as a single corporation, and adjusting value in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (g) Example 4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the nomenclature and assumptions of the examples in Sec. 1.382-2T(b) apply, all corporations file separate income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, and the facts set forth the only owner shifts with respect to the corporations during the testing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Public L owns all of the L stock, L and Public L1 own 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of the L1 stock, and L1 owns all of the corporation T stock. L1 has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 4. L has a net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 4. On August 1, Year 3, L acquires 30 percent of the stock of L1, thereby increasing its percentage ownership interest in L1 to 60 percent. On December 1, Year 3, L1 purchases all of the stock of corporation S from Public S. On November 1, Year 4, P acquires all of the L stock. The acquisition by P of all of the L stock on November 1, Year 4, causes ownership changes of both L and L1 under the rules of Sec. 1.382-2T. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts.

component members of a controlled group both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Year 1 net operating loss carryover of L1 is a controlled group loss because L1 is a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 1, the year to which the loss is attributable. L1 and T compose a controlled group with respect to the net operating loss carryover because L1 and T are

component members of a controlled group both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to the taxable year to which L1's net operating loss carryover is attributable (i.e., Year 1); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On November 1, Year 4, L1's change date. Although L and S are component members of L1's controlled group on L1's change date, they are not component members of the controlled group with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover because they were not component members with respect to the year to which the net operating loss carryover is attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of L1's stock must therefore be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section to take into account an adjustment with respect to the T stock (but not the S stock) in computing L1's limitation under section 382 with respect to its net operating loss carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Although L is a member of a controlled group composed of L, L1, S, and T on November 1, Year 4, L's change date, it is not a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 2, the taxable year to which its net operating loss carryover is attributable. Therefore, L's Year 2 net operating loss carryover is not a controlled group loss under paragraph (b) of this section and the value of L's stock is not adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section to compute L's limitation under section 382 with respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Since Year 1, A has owned all of the stock of L, L and B have owned 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the stock of corporation P, and P and C have owned 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the stock of L1. L and L1 each has a net operating loss for the Year 6 taxable year that is carried over to its respective Year 7 taxable year. On December 1, Year 7, A sells all of the L stock to D. The sale results in ownership changes of both L and L1. Immediately before the ownership changes, the total value of the L1 stock is $40, the total value of the P stock (including the value of its L1 stock) is $100, and the total value of the L stock (including the value of the P stock) is $200. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts.

L1 does not elect to restore any value to P paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The value of the stock of P ($100) is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the stock of L1 that it directly owns, $30 (75%x$40). Following the adjustment, the value of the stock of P is $70. P elects to restore this entire $70 of value to L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The value of the stock of L, $200, is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the stock of P it directly owns, i.e., $80 (80%x$100), and increased paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the amount P elects to restore to L, i.e., $70. Thus, the value of the L stock for purposes of determining L's limitation under section 382 with respect to its net operating loss carryover from Year 6 is $190 ($200-$80+$70).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that L1 elects to restore $20 to P. For purposes of determining L1's limitation under section 382 with respect to the Year 6 net operating loss carryover, the value of the stock of L1 is $20 ($40-$20) because the value of its stock is reduced under paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the $20 of value it elects to restore to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The value of the stock of P ($100) is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the L1 stock it directly owns ($30), and is increased paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the value that L1 elects to restore to P ($20).

The members of a controlled group on January 1, 1997, that have had an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss before January 1, 1997, must determine the limitations under section 382 for any post-change year with respect to controlled group losses by using a reasonable method to preclude the value of stock of a component member that was owned directly or indirectly by another member immediately after an ownership change from being taken into account more than once in determining the limitations under section 382 with respect to

controlled group losses. If such a reasonable method was not used for a post-change year, subject to the exception in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the members of the controlled group described in the preceding sentence must reduce their limitations under section 382 for post-change years for which the income tax return is filed after January 1, 1997, to recapture, as quickly as possible, any limitation that members took into account in excess of the amount that would be allowable under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

For purposes of this section, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, the controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss does not include a corporation that is not a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991. Thus, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, paragraph (c) of this section does not require that a loss corporation that is a component member of a controlled group to disregard the value of stock of another corporation directly owned immediately after the ownership change in determining the value of its own stock unless the other corporation is a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amended returns.

However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (c)(2), (e)(4) and (h) of this section to any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30, 2006, see Sec. 1.382-8 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
