A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be taken only

during the school term. No compensation for or carryover of unused leave is authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sick leave.

Medical and dental appointments may be included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of four hours each biweekly pay period in pay status during the term of the contract; and no precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of separation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> School vacation.

School vacations are scheduled on the annual school calendar during the instructional year and may not be scheduled before the first day of student instruction or after the last day of student instruction. School vacations are not a right of the employee and cannot be paid for or carried over if the employee is required to work during the school vacation time or if the program will not permit school term employees to take such vacation time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Leave for full-time, year-long employees. Employees who are on a full-time, year-long contract are authorized the following types of leave:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vacation leave.

The supervisor will determine when vacation leave may be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an employee on the day following his or her date of employment, provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks. An employee may carry into succeeding years up to 200 hours of vacation leave. Leave unused at the time of separation is forfeited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sick leave. Sick leave accumulation and use is authorized on the same basis as for school term employees under Sec. 38.12(a)(2) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Leave for part-time year-long employees.
