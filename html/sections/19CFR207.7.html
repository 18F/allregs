                                Sec. 207.7  Limited disclosure of certain business proprietary
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure. Upon receipt of a timely application filed by an  authorized applicant, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  which describes in general terms the information requested, and sets  forth the reasons for the request (e.g., all business proprietary  information properly disclosed pursuant to this section for the purpose  of representing an interested party in investigations pending before the  Commission), the Secretary shall make available all business proprietary  information contained in Commission memoranda and reports and in written  submissions filed with the Commission at any time during the  investigation (except nondisclosable confidential business information)  to the authorized applicant under an administrative protective order  described in paragraph (b) of this section. The term ``business  proprietary information'' has the same meaning as the term  ``confidential business information'' as defined in Sec. 201.6 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. An application under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section must be made by an authorized applicant on a form adopted by the  Secretary or a photocopy thereof. A signed application shall be filed  electronically. An application on behalf of a petitioner, a respondent,  or another party must be made no later than the time that entries of  appearance are due pursuant to Sec. 201.11 of this chapter. In the  event that two or more authorized applicants represent one interested  party who is a party to the investigation, the authorized applicants  must select one of their   number to be lead authorized applicant. The lead authorized applicant's  application must be filed no later than the time that entries of  appearance are due. Provided that the application is accepted, the lead  authorized applicant shall be served with business proprietary  information pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. The other  authorized applicants representing the same party may file their  applications after the deadline for entries of appearance but at least  five days before the deadline for filing posthearing briefs in the  investigation, or the deadline for filing briefs in the preliminary  phase of an investigation, or the deadline for filing submissions in a  remanded investigation, and shall not be served with business  proprietary information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized applicant. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Only an authorized applicant may file  an application under this subsection. An authorized applicant is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An attorney for an interested party which is a party to the  investigation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A consultant or expert under the direction and control of a  person under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A consultant or expert who appears regularly before the  Commission and who represents an interested party which is a party to  the investigation; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A representative of an interested party which is a party to the  investigation, if such interested party is not represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition, an authorized applicant must not be involved in  competitive decisionmaking for an interested party which is a party to  the investigation. Involvement in ``competitive decisionmaking''  includes past, present, or likely future activities, associations, and  relationships with an interested party which is a party to the  investigation that involve the prospective authorized applicant's advice  or participation in any of such party's decisions made in light of  similar or corresponding information about a competitor (pricing,  product design, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Forms and determinations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary may adopt, from time  to time, forms for submitting requests for disclosure pursuant to an  administrative protective order incorporating the terms of this rule.  The Secretary shall determine whether the requirements for release of  information under this rule have been satisfied. This determination  shall be made concerning specific business proprietary information as  expeditiously as possible but in no event later than fourteen (14) days  from the filing of the information, or seven (7) days in the preliminary  phase of an investigation, except if the submitter of the information  objects to its release or the information is unusually voluminous or  complex, in which case the determination shall be made within thirty  (30) days from the filing of the information, or ten (10) days in the  preliminary phase of an investigation. The Secretary shall establish a  list of parties whose applications have been granted. The Secretary's  determination shall be final for purposes of review by the U.S. Court of  International Trade under section 777(c)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Should the Secretary determine pursuant to this section that  materials sought to be protected from public disclosure by a person do  not constitute business proprietary information or were not required to  be served under paragraph (f) of this section, then the Secretary shall,  upon request, issue an order on behalf of the Commission requiring the  return of all copies of such materials served in accordance with  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary shall release business proprietary information  only to an authorized applicant whose application has been accepted and  who presents the application along with adequate personal  identification; or a person described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this  section who presents a copy of the statement referred to in that  paragraph along with adequate personal identification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An authorized applicant granted access to business proprietary  information in the preliminary phase of an investigation may, subject to  paragraph (c) of this section, retain such business proprietary  information during any final phase of that investigation, provided that  the authorized applicant has not lost his authorized applicant status  (e.g., by terminating his representation of an interested party who is a  party). When retaining business proprietary   information pursuant to this paragraph, the authorized applicant need  not file a new application in the final phase of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative protective order. The administrative protective  order under which information is made available to the authorized  applicant shall require the applicant to submit to the Secretary a  personal sworn statement that, in addition to such other conditions as  the Secretary may require, the applicant shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not divulge any of the business proprietary information obtained  under the administrative protective order and not otherwise available to  the applicant, to any person other than</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Personnel of the Commission concerned with the investigation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person or agency from whom the business proprietary  information was obtained,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A person whose application for access to business proprietary  information under the administrative protective order has been granted  by the Secretary, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other persons, such as paralegals and clerical staff, who are  employed or supervised by the authorized applicant; who have a need  thereof in connection with the investigation; who are not involved in  competitive decision making for an interested party which is a party to  the investigation; and who have signed a statement in a form approved by  the Secretary that they agree to be bound by the administrative  protective order (the authorized applicant shall be responsible for  retention and accuracy of such forms and shall be deemed responsible for  such persons' compliance with the administrative protective order);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use such business proprietary information solely for the  purposes of representing an interested party in the Commission  investigation then in progress or during judicial or other review of  such Commission investigation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not consult with any person not described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section concerning such business proprietary information without  first having received the written consent of the Secretary and the party  or the attorney of the party from whom such business proprietary  information was obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whenever materials (e.g., documents, computer disks, etc.)  containing such business proprietary information are not being used,  store such material in a locked file cabinet, vault, safe, or other  suitable container;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Serve all materials containing business proprietary information  as directed by the Secretary and pursuant to paragraph (f) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transmit all materials containing business proprietary  information with a cover sheet identifying the materials as containing  business proprietary information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Comply with the provisions of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Make true and accurate representations in the authorized  applicant's application and promptly notify the Secretary of any changes  that occur after the submission of the application and that affect the  representations made in the application (e.g., change in personnel  assigned to the investigation);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Report promptly and confirm in writing to the Secretary any  breach of the administrative protective order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Acknowledge that breach of the administrative protective order  may subject the authorized applicant to such sanctions or other actions  as the Commission deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final disposition of material released under administrative  protective order. At such date as the Secretary may determine  appropriate for particular data, each authorized applicant shall return  or destroy all copies of materials released to authorized applicants  pursuant to this section and all other materials containing business  proprietary information, such as charts or notes based on any such  information received under administrative protective order, and file  with the Secretary a certificate attesting to his personal, good faith  belief that all copies of such material have been returned or destroyed  and no copies of such material have been made available to any person to  whom disclosure was not specifically authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commission responses to a breach of administrative protective  order. A breach   of an administrative protective order may subject an offender to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disbarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission  along with such person's partners, associates, employer, and employees,  for up to seven years following publication of a determination that the  order has been breached;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referral to the United States Attorney;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an attorney, accountant, or other professional,  referral to the ethics panel of the appropriate professional  association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines  to be appropriate, including public release of or striking from the  record any information or briefs submitted by, or on behalf of, the  offender or the party represented by the offender, denial of further  access to business proprietary information in the current or any future  investigations before the Commission, and issuance of a public or  private letter of reprimand; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning  letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Breach investigation procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission shall  determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective  order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the  later of the date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as  determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the  exercise of reasonable and ordinary care, or the completion of an  investigation conducted under subpart B or C of this part, the  Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of an  administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time  during the pendency of the investigation, including all appeals,  remands, and subsequent appeals. Whenever the Commission has reason to  believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective  order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a  letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe a  breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to  present his views on whether a breach has occurred. If subsequently the  Commission determines that a breach has occurred and that further  investigation is warranted, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing  such person of that determination and that the person has a reasonable  opportunity to present his views on whether mitigating circumstances  exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but no longer on  whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been afforded a  reasonable opportunity to present his views, the Commission shall  determine what sanction if any to impose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction  pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two year  period, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for  possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at  the end of the two year period. Upon the completion of such a pending  breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original  sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction  recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party filing written submissions which include  business proprietary information to the Commission during an  investigation shall at the same time serve complete copies of such  submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list  established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this  section, and, except as provided in Sec. 207.3, a nonbusiness  proprietary version on all other parties. All such submissions must be  accompanied by a certificate attesting that complete copies of the  submission have been properly served. In the event that a submission is  filed before the Secretary's list is established, the document need not  be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the submission shall be  served within two (2) days   of the establishment of the list and a certificate of service shall then  be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a party's request under paragraph (g) of this section is  granted, the Secretary shall accept the nondisclosable confidential  business information into the record. The party shall serve the  submission containing such information in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 207.3(b) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  with the information redacted from the copies served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary shall not accept for filing into the record of an  investigation submissions filed without a proper certificate of service.  Failure to comply with paragraph (f) of this section may result in  denial of party status and such sanctions as the Commission deems  appropriate. Business proprietary information in submissions must be  dealt with as required by Sec. 207.3(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exemption from disclosure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Any person may  request exemption from the disclosure of business proprietary  information under administrative protective order, whether the person  desires to include such information in a petition filed under Sec.  207.10, or any other submission to the Commission during the course of  an investigation. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary  finds that such information is nondisclosable confidential business  information. As defined in Sec. 201.6(a)(2) of this chapter,  nondisclosable confidential business information is privileged  information, classified information, or specific information (e.g.,  trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need  to withhold from disclosure. The request will be granted or denied not  later than thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in a preliminary phase  investigation) after the date on which the request is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request for exemption. A request for exemption from disclosure  must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor.  At the same time as the request is filed, one copy of the business  proprietary information in question must be lodged with the Secretary  solely for the purpose of obtaining a determination as to the request.  The business proprietary information for which exemption from disclosure  is sought shall remain the property of the requester, and shall not  become or be incorporated into any agency record until such time as the  request is granted. A request should, when possible, be filed two  business days prior to the deadline, if any, for filing the document in  which the information for which exemption from disclosure is sought is  proposed to be included. If the request is denied, the copy of the  information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the  requester. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary finds  that such information is privileged information, classified information,  or specific information of a type for which there is a clear and  compelling need to withhold from disclosure. The Secretary shall  promptly notify the requester as to whether the request has been  approved or denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedure if request is approved. If the request is approved,  the person shall file three versions of the submission containing the  nondisclosable confidential business information in question. One  version shall contain all business proprietary information, bracketed in  accordance with Sec. 201.6 of this chapter and Sec. 207.3. The other  two versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 201.6 of this chapter and Sec. 207.3, except that  the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was  granted shall be redacted from the submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedure if request is denied. If the request is denied, the  copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be  returned to the requester. The requester may file the submission in  question without that information, in accordance with the requirements  of Sec. 207.3.
