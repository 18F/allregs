                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval. The approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before the defense services described in Sec. 120.9(a) of this subchapter may be furnished. In order to obtain such approval, the U.S. person must submit a proposed agreement to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Such agreements are generally characterized as manufacturing license agreements, technical assistance agreements, distribution agreements, or off-shore procurement agreements, and may not enter into force without the prior written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Once approved, the defense services described in the agreements may generally be provided without further licensing in accordance with Sec. Sec. 124.3 and 125.4(b)(2) of this subchapter. The requirements of this section apply whether or not technical data is to be disclosed or used in the performance of the defense services described in Sec. 120.9(a) of this subchapter (e.g., all the information relied upon by the U.S. person in performing the defense service is in the public domain or is otherwise exempt from licensing requirements of this subchapter pursuant to Sec. 125.4 of this subchapter). This requirement also applies to the training of any foreign military forces, regular and irregular, in the use of defense articles. Technical assistance agreements must be submitted in such cases. In exceptional cases, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, upon written request, will consider approving the provision of defense services described in Sec. 120.9(a) of this subchapter by granting a license under part 125 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classified articles. Copies of approved agreements involving the release of classified defense articles will be forwarded by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to the Defense Security Service of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendments. Changes to the scope of approved agreements, including modifications, upgrades, or extensions must be submitted for approval. The amendments may not enter into force until approved by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minor amendments. Amendments which only alter delivery or performance schedules, or other minor administrative amendments which do not affect in any manner the duration of the agreement or the clauses or information which must be included in such agreements because of the requirements of this part, do not have to be submitted for approval. One copy of all such minor amendments must be submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls within thirty days after they are concluded.
