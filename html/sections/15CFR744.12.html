                            <p class="depth0">BIS maintains restrictions on exports and reexports to persons designated in or pursuant to Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 (Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism). These persons include individuals and entities listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13224, as well as persons subsequently designated by the Secretary of State or Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to criteria set forth in the Order. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains 31 CFR part 594, the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. OFAC announces the names of persons designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 in the Federal Register and includes such persons in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V, which lists persons subject to various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. The Department of State also announces the names of foreign persons designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 in the Federal Register. All persons designated in or pursuant to Executive Order 13224 are identified in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V by the bracketed initials [SDGT] and are also known as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License requirement(s).

Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export from the United States or an export or reexport by a U.S. person to an

SDGT, no separate authorization from BIS is necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or reexport to an SDGT of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to OFAC's Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations in 31 CFR part 594.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for any export from abroad or reexport to an SDGT of any item subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any export or reexport to an SDGT of any item subject to both the EAR and OFAC's regulatory authority pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and not authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any export or reexport by a U.S. person to an SDGT of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to regulation by OFAC and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad or reexport by a non-U.S. person to an SDGT of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions.
