                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A refinery or importer shall use the methodology specified in this section for determining a compliance baseline if it cannot determine an applicable toxics value for every batch of gasoline produced or imported for 12 or more consecutive months during January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> A refinery or importer that cannot determine an applicable toxics value on every batch of gasoline produced or imported for 12 or more consecutive months during the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000 or a refinery or importer that did not produce or import reformulated gasoline and/or RBOB (combined) or conventional gasoline or both during the period between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000, inclusive, shall have the following as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A refinery or importer that cannot determine an applicable toxics value on every batch of gasoline produced or imported for 12 or more consecutive months during the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000 or a refinery or importer that did not produce or import reformulated gasoline and/or RBOB (combined) or conventional gasoline or both during the period between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000, inclusive, shall have the following as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For conventional gasoline, prior to January 1, 2006, 94.64 mg/mile; starting January 1, 2006, 97.38 mg/mile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For reformulated gasoline, prior to January 1, 2006, 25.31 percent reduction from statutory baseline; starting January 1, 2006, 26.78 percent reduction from statutory baseline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> A refinery or importer that has an approved anti-dumping baseline under Sec. 80.93(d) for gasoline produced or imported for use in Alaska, and that cannot determine an applicable toxics value according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall have the following as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart: 110.72 mg/mile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A refinery or importer that has an approved anti-dumping baseline under Sec. 80.93(d) for gasoline produced or imported for use in Alaska, and that cannot determine an applicable toxics value according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall have the following as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart: 110.72 mg/mile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A refinery or importer that has an approved anti-dumping baseline under Sec. 80.93(d) for gasoline produce or imported for use in Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and that cannot determine an applicable toxics value according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall have the following as its compliance

baseline for the purposes of this subpart: 77.82 mg/mile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) shall apply to any refiner, for any refinery, or importer that received approval of a petition under Sec. 80.93(d) prior to November 26, 2007 beginning with the 2008 annual averaging period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any new refiner or importer without a toxics baseline that produces or imports gasoline for use in Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands shall be subject to the applicable toxics default baseline under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the refiner or importer petitions for and receives approval of use of a seasonal baseline and seasonal Complex Model under Sec. 80.93(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Eligibility to petition. A refiner who has been granted an alternative anti-dumping averaging period under Sec. 80.101(k) may petition the Administrator to have the statutory baseline exhaust toxics emissions, Phase II value specified in Sec. 80.91(c)(5)(iv) as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart J for one or more of the years of the refiner's approved alternative anti-dumping averaging period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility to petition. A refiner who has been granted an alternative anti-dumping averaging period under Sec. 80.101(k) may petition the Administrator to have the statutory baseline exhaust toxics emissions, Phase II value specified in Sec. 80.91(c)(5)(iv) as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart J for one or more of the years of the refiner's approved alternative anti-dumping averaging period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application process.

The timeline shall include the date by which the refinery will produce conventional gasoline that complies with the baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section on an annual average basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Approval or disapproval of petitions. (i) The Administrator may approve a petition if it includes information sufficient to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that cost and/or technological constraints make it infeasible for the refinery to comply with the baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
