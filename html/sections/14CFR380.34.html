An arrangement that furnishes a lesser degree of protection than would be provided under the bond shall be invalid to that extent, and instead the bank, the charter operator or foreign charter operator, and the charter participants shall have the same rights and liabilities as provided under

a bond in the form of appendix A. If the arrangement does not give as much protection as a bond against the risk of the charter operator's bankruptcy, the bank shall be liable in the event of bankruptcy to the same extent as if it had entered into a bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any agreement under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall include a statement that, in the event that the other provisions of the agreement do not provide protection to charter participants comparable to that provided under a bond in the form of appendix A, the bank shall assume, for the benefit of the charter participants, all the liabilities it would have if it entered into the bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The security agreement shall be effective on or before the date the charter prospectus is filed with the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The security agreement shall be specifically identified by the issuing securer with a numbering system so that the Department can identify the security agreement with the specific charter or charters to which it relates.

For purposes of this section the term ``State'' includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When security is provided by a security agreement other than a bond, the agreement shall be issued by a national bank complying with the provisions of 12 CFR 7.7010(a), or by a State bank complying with applicable State laws that give authority to issue such agreements, and all such banks must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The security agreement required by this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or foreign charter operator, or, if it is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to such charter participant. Terminations means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary.


Sec.  380.34a  Substitution of direct air carrier's security or depository agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A direct air carrier may substitute its own security agreement and/or depository arrangements, as specified in this section, for those required of the charter operator under Sec.  380.34, but only for charter trips in which all the air transportation is provided by one direct air carrier. Charter operators are relieved from Sec.  380.34 to the extent that the direct carrier substitutes its own arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The direct air carrier may substitute its security agreement for all of the arrangements required of the charter operator under Sec.  380.34 (a) or (b). Alternatively, it may substitute its depository agreement for the depository agreement required of the charter operator under Sec.  380.34(b)(2). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement, it may also obtain and substitute a security agreement for the one otherwise required of the charter operator under Sec.  380.34(b)(1). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement only, the charter operator must supply the security agreement required under Sec.  380.34(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement for all the charter operator's requirements under Sec.  380.34, the charter operator shall include in the charter prospectus, in place of the information in Sec.  380.28(a)(2) regarding the charter operator's security agreement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement by the direct air carrier on OST Form 4535 that it will take responsibility for all charter participant payments (including those for

ground accommodations and services) and for the fulfillment of all the charter operator's contractual and regulatory obligations to the charter participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A statement from the direct air carrier and its securer (under Sec.  212.12 of this chapter), OST Form 4533, that they have entered into a security agreement assuring the direct air carrier's responsibilities to charter participants under this section in an unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant), and that the securer has received a copy of the proposed flight schedule identified by the schedule number assigned by the charter operator under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A substitute depository agreement under this section shall be signed by the direct air carrier, the charter operator, and the depository bank, and shall provide, in addition to existing requirements under Sec.  212.8 of this chapter, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payments by or on behalf of charter participants shall be allocated to the flight accounts matching the participant's itinerary in the following way: Each account shall have allocated to it the charter cost of the participant's air transportation on that flight. The portion of each payment not intended for air transportation services shall be allocated to the account for the return flight in the participant's itinerary. If there is only one flight in the itinerary, the entire payment shall be allocated to that account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bank shall pay funds from a flight account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter flight, upon presentation to the bank of vendor's bills and upon certification by the person who contracted for the ground accommodations or services of the amounts payable and the persons or companies to whom payment is to be made, except that no disbursement shall be made that would reduce the balance in the account below the charter cost of the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On sales made to participants by a person other than a retail travel agent, the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit card draft payable to the bank. On sales made to participants by a retail travel agent, payments shall be made in the same manner unless the agent deducts its commission and remits the balance to the bank by check, money order, or electronic transfer. The agent may deduct its commission only if it agrees in writing with its principal (the charter operator or direct air carrier, as applicable) that, if the charter is canceled, the agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt of notification of the cancellation. The depository bank shall pay refunds directly to participants according to the terms of the operator-participant contract and the terms of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement in addition to substituting a depository agreement, the charter prospectus information must include all the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, except for the amount of the security agreement. That agreement shall be in an amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than $200,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A copy of the depository agreement under paragraph (d) of this section shall be filed with the Department, and it shall not be effective until approved by the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A copy of the security agreement under paragraph (c) or paragraph (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department. It shall insure the financial responsibility of the direct air carrier for supplying the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contracts between the charter operator and the charter participants. Such security agreement shall meet all the other requirements of Sec.  380.34 (c) and (d).</p>
