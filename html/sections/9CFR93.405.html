                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All ruminants intended for importation from any part of the world, except as provided in Sec. Sec. 93.423(c) and 93.428(d), shall be accompanied by a certificate issued by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of origin, or issued by a veterinarian designated or accredited by the national government of the region of origin and endorsed by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of origin, representing that the veterinarian issuing the certificate was authorized to do so. The certificate shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the ruminants have been kept in that region during the last 60 days immediately preceding the date of shipment to the United States, and that during this time the region has

been entirely free from foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, contagious pleuropneumonia, and surra; provided, however, that for wild ruminants for exhibition purposes, the certificate need specify only that the district of origin has been free from the listed diseases; and provided further, that for sheep and goats, with respect to contagious pleuropneumonia, the certificate may specify only that the district of origin has been free from this disease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the ruminants are not in quarantine in the region of origin; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the ruminants are from any region where screwworm is considered to exist, the ruminants may be imported into the United States only if they meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section and all other applicable requirements of this part. APHIS will maintain a list of regions where screwworm is considered to exist on the APHIS Web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/animals/animal--disease--status.shtml. Copies of the list will also be available via postal mail, fax, or email upon request to the Sanitary Trade Issues Team, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737. APHIS will add a region to the list upon determining that screwworm exists in the region based on reports APHIS receives of detections of the pest from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable. APHIS will remove a region from the list after conducting an evaluation of the region in accordance with Sec. 92.2 of this subchapter and finding that screwworm is not present in the region. In the case of a region formerly not on this list that is added due to a detection, the region may be removed from the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in Sec. 92.4 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A veterinarian must treat the ruminants with ivermectin 3 to 5 days prior to the date of export to the United States according to the recommended dose prescribed on the product's label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ruminants must be fully examined for screwworm by a full-time salaried veterinary official of the exporting country within 24 hours prior to shipment to the United States. If ruminants are found to be infested with screwworm, they must be treated until free from infestation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the time ruminants are loaded onto a means of conveyance for export, a veterinarian must treat any visible wounds on the animals with a solution of coumaphos dust at a concentration of 5 percent active ingredient.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The ruminants must be accompanied to the United States by a certificate signed by a full-time salaried veterinary official of the exporting country. The certificate must state that the ruminants have been thoroughly examined and found free of screwworm and that the ruminants have been treated in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the ruminants are sheep or goats from Canada, the certificate must also include the name and address of the importer; the species, breed, number or quantity of ruminants to be imported; the purpose of the importation; individual ruminant identification, which includes the official identification required under Sec. 93.419(c) of this subchapter, and any other identification present on the animal, including registration number, if any; a description of the ruminant, including age, color, and markings, if any; region of origin; the address of or other means of identifying the premises of origin and any other premises where the ruminants resided immediately prior to export, including the State or its equivalent, the municipality or nearest city, or an equivalent method, approved by the Administrator, of identifying the location of the premises, and the specific physical location of the destination where the ruminants are to be moved after importation; the name and address of the exporter; the port of embarkation in the foreign region; and the mode of transportation, route of travel, and port of entry in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Goats.
