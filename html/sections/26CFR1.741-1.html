                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership shall, except to the extent section 751(a) applies, be treated as the sale or exchange of a capital asset, resulting in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted basis of the partnership interest, as determined under section 705. For treatment of selling partner's distributive share up to date of sale, see section 706(c)(2). Where the provisions of section 751 require the recognition of ordinary income or loss with respect to a portion of the amount realized from such sale or exchange, the amount realized shall be reduced by the amount attributable under section 751 to unrealized receivables and substantially appreciated inventory items, and the adjusted basis of the transferor partner's interest in the partnership shall be reduced by the portion of such basis attributable to such unrealized receivables and substantially appreciated inventory items. See section 751 and Sec. 1.751-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 741 shall apply whether the partnership interest is sold to one or more members of the partnership or to one or more persons who are not members of the partnership. Section 741 shall also apply even though the sale of the partnership interest results in a termination of the partnership under section 708(b). Thus, the provisions of section 741 shall be applicable (1) to the transferor partner in a 2-man

partnership when he sells his interest to the other partner, and (2) to all the members of a partnership when they sell their interests to one or more persons outside the partnership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> See section 351 for nonrecognition of gain or loss upon transfer of a partnership interest to a corporation controlled by the transferor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For rules relating to the treatment of liabilities on the sale or exchange of interests in a partnership see Sec. Sec. 1.752-1 and 1.1001-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For rules relating to the capital gain or loss recognized when a partner sells or exchanges an interest in a partnership that holds appreciated collectibles or section 1250 property with section 1250 capital gain, see Sec. 1.1(h)-1. This paragraph (e) applies to transfers of interests in partnerships that occur on or after September 21, 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For rules relating to dividing the holding period of an interest in a partnership, see Sec. 1.1223-3. This paragraph (f) applies to transfers of partnership interests and distributions of property from a partnership that occur on or after September 21, 2000.
