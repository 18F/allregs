                                Sec. 405.1885  Reopening a contractor determination or reviewing
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) A Secretary determination, a contractor determination, or a decision by a reviewing entity (as described in Sec. 405.1801(a)) may be reopened, with respect to specific findings on matters at issue in a determination or decision, by CMS (with respect to Secretary determinations), by the contractor (with respect to contractor determinations), or by the reviewing entity that made the decision (as described in paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A specific finding on a matter at issue may be legal or factual in nature or a mixed matter of both law and fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A specific finding on a matter at issue may include a factual matter

that arose in or was determined for the same cost reporting period as the period at issue in an appeal filed, or a reopening requested by a provider or initiated by a contractor, under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A specific finding on a matter at issue may include a predicate fact, which is a finding of fact based on a factual matter that first arose in or was first determined for a cost reporting period that predates the period at issue (in an appeal filed, or a reopening requested by a provider or initiated by a contractor, under this subpart), and once determined, was used to determine an aspect of the provider's reimbursement for one or more later cost reporting periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except as provided for by this section, Sec. 405.1887, and Sec. 405.1889, a specific finding on a matter at issue may not be reopened and, if reopened, revised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A determination or decision may be reopened either through own motion of CMS (for Secretary determinations), the contractor or reviewing entity, by notifying the parties to the determination or decision (as specified in Sec. 405.1887), or by granting the request of the provider affected by the determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A contractor's discretion to reopen or not reopen a matter is subject to a contrary directive from CMS to reopen or not reopen that matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If CMS directs a contractor to reopen a matter, reopening is considered an own motion reopening by the contractor. A reopening may result in a revision of any matter at issue in the determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a matter is reopened and a revised determination or decision is made, a revised determination or decision is appealable to the extent provided in Sec. 405.1889 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A determination or decision to reopen or not to reopen a determination or decision is not a final determination or decision within the meaning of this subpart and is not subject to further administrative review or judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time limits--(1) Own motion reopening of a determination not procured by fraud or similar fault. An own motion reopening is timely only if the notice of intent to reopen (as described in Sec. 405.1887 of this subpart) is mailed no later than 3 years after the date of the determination or decision that is the subject of the reopening. The date the notice is mailed is presumed to be the date indicated on the notice unless it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the notice was mailed on a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Request for reopening of a determination not based on fraud or similar fault. (i) A reopening made upon request is timely only if the request to reopen is received by CMS, the contractor, or reviewing entity, as appropriate, no later than 3 years after the date of the determination or decision that is the subject of the requested reopening. The date of receipt by CMS, the contractor, or the reviewing entity of the request to reopen is conclusively presumed to be the date of delivery by a nationally-recognized next-day courier, or the date stamped ``Received'' by CMS, the contractor or the reviewing entity (where a nationally-recognized next-day courier is not employed), unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that CMS, the contractor, or the reviewing entity received the request on an earlier date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request to reopen does not toll the time in which to appeal an otherwise appealable determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A request to reopen that is received within the 3-year period described in this paragraph is timely, notwithstanding that the notice of reopening required under Sec. 405.1887 of this subpart is issued after such 3-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The 3-year period described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section applies to, and is calculated separately for, each specific finding on a matter at issue (as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section, but not to such findings when made as part of a determination of reasonable cost under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reopening of a determination procured by fraud or similar fault. A Secretary or contractor determination or decision by the reviewing entity may be reopened and revised at any time if it is established that the determination

or decision was procured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Jurisdiction for reopening. Jurisdiction for reopening a contractor determination or contractor hearing decision rests exclusively with the contractor or contractor hearing officer(s) that rendered the determination or decision (or, when applicable, with the successor contractor), subject to a directive from CMS to reopen or not reopen the determination or decision. Jurisdiction for reopening a Secretary determination, CMS reviewing official decision, a Board decision, or an Administrator decision rests exclusively with CMS, the CMS reviewing official, Board or Administrator, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CMS-directed reopenings. CMS may direct a contractor or contractor hearing officer(s) to reopen and revise any matter, subject to the time limits specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and subject to the limitation expressed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by providing explicit direction to the contractor or contractor hearing officer(s) to reopen and revise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples. A contractor determination or contractor hearing decision must be reopened and revised if CMS provides explicit notice to the contractor that the contractor determination or the contractor hearing decision is inconsistent with the applicable law, regulations, CMS ruling, or other interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by CMS in effect, and as CMS understood those legal provisions, at the time the determination or decision was rendered by the contractor. CMS may also direct the contractor to reopen a particular contractor determination or decision in order to implement a final agency decision (as described in Sec. Sec. 405.1833, 405.1871(b) and 405.1875 of this subpart), a final, non-appealable court judgment Sec. 405.1877, or an agreement to settle an administrative appeal or a lawsuit, regarding the same determination or decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibited reopenings. A change of legal interpretation or policy by CMS in a regulation, CMS ruling, or other interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by CMS, whether made in response to judicial precedent or otherwise, is not a basis for reopening a CMS or contractor determination, a contractor hearing decision, a CMS reviewing official decision, a Board decision, or an Administrator decision, under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reopening by CMS or contractor of determination currently on appeal to the Board or Administrator. CMS or a contractor may reopen, on its own motion or on request of the provider(s), a Secretary or contractor determination that is currently pending on appeal before the Board or Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The scope of the reopening may include any matter covered by the determination, including those specific matters that are appealed to the Board or the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contractor must send a copy of the notice required under Sec. 405.1887(a) to the Board or to the Administrator, through the Office of the Attorney Advisor, specifically informing that the matter(s) to be addressed by the reopening is currently under appeal to the Board or to the Administrator or is covered by the same determination that is under appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reopening of determination within the time for appealing that determination to the Board. CMS or a contractor may reopen, on its own motion or on request of the provider(s), a Secretary or contractor determination for which no appeal was taken to the Board, but for which the time to appeal to the Board has not yet expired, by sending the notice specified in Sec. 405.1887(a) of this subpart.
