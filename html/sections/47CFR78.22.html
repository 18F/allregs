                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party in interest may file a petition to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended) no later than thirty (30) days after issuance of a public notice of the acceptance for filing of any such application or amendment thereto. Petitions to deny shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner may file a reply to such opposition (see Sec.  1.45 of this chapter), in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, before Commission action on any application for an instrument of authorization, any person may file informal objections to the grant. Such objections may be submitted in letter form (without extra copies) and shall be signed by the objector. The limitation on pleadings and time for filing pleadings provided for in Sec.  1.45 of this chapter shall not be applicable to any objections duly filed pursuant to this paragraph.
