                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A producer described in Sec. 1150.152(a)(1) and (a)(2) who operates under an approved National Organic Program (NOP) (7 CFR part 205) system plan; produces only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP, except as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section; and is not a split operation shall be exempt from the payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To apply for exemption under this section, a producer pursuant to Sec. 1150.152 (a)(1) and (a)(2) shall submit a request for exemption to the Board on a form provided by the Board at any time initially and annually thereafter on or before July 1 as long as the producer continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A producer request for exemption shall include the following: the producer's name and address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent as defined in section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6502), a signed certification that the applicant meets all of the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section for an assessment exemption, and such other information as may be required by the Board and with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a producer described in Sec. 1150.152(a)(1) and (a)(2) complies with the requirements of this section, the Board will grant an assessment exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the producer within 30 days. If the application is disapproved, the Board will notify the applicant of the reason(s) for disapproval within the same timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The producer described in paragraph (c) of this section shall provide a copy of the Certificate of Exemption to each person responsible for remitting assessments to the Board on behalf of the producer pursuant to Sec. 1150.152(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The person responsible for remitting assessments to the Board pursuant to Sec. 1150.152(a) shall maintain records showing the exempt producer's name and address and the exemption number assigned by the Board pursuant to Sec. 1150.172(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An importer who imports only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP (7 CFR part 205) and who is not a split operation shall be exempt from the payment of assessments. That importer may submit documentation to the Board and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent organic dairy products--on a form provided by the Board--at any time initially and annually thereafter as long as the importer continues to be eligible for the exemption. This documentation shall include the same information required of producers in paragraph (c) of this section. If the importer complies with the requirements of this section, the Board will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the

importer. The Board will issue the importer a 9-digit alphanumeric Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification valid for 1 year from the date of issue. This HTS classification should be entered by the importer on the Customs entry documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The exemption will apply not later than the last day of the month following the Certificate of Exemption issuance date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Agricultural commodities produced and marketed under an organic system plan, as described in 7 CFR 205.201, but not sold, labeled, or represented as organic, shall not disqualify a producer from exemption under this section, except that producers who produce both organic and non-organic agricultural commodities as a result of split operations shall not qualify for exemption. Reasons for conventional sales include lack of demand for organic products, isolated use of antibiotics for humane purposes, chemical or pesticide use as the result of State or emergency spray programs, and crops from a buffer area as described in 7 CFR part 205, provided all other criteria are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Importers who are exempt from assessment in paragraph (g) of this section shall be eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by the CBP and may apply to the Secretary for a reimbursement. The importer would be required to submit satisfactory proof to the Secretary that the importer paid the assessment on exempt organic products.
