                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners or operators of new tank systems or components must  obtain and submit to the Regional Administrator, at time of submittal of  part B information, a written assessment, reviewed and certified by a  qualified Professional Engineer, in accordance with Sec. 270.11(d) of  this chapter, attesting that the tank system has sufficient structural  integrity and is acceptable for the storing and treating of hazardous  waste. The assessment must show that the foundation, structural support,  seams, connections, and pressure controls (if applicable) are adequately  designed and that the tank system has sufficient structural strength,  compatibility with the waste(s) to be stored or treated, and corrosion  protection to ensure that it will not collapse, rupture, or fail. This  assessment, which will be used by the Regional Administrator to review  and approve or disapprove the acceptability of the tank system design,  must include, at a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design standard(s) according to which tank(s) and/or the  ancillary equipment are constructed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hazardous characteristics of the waste(s) to be handled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For new tank systems or components in which the external shell  of a metal tank or any external metal component of the tank system will  be in contact with the soil or with water, a determination by a  corrosion expert of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Factors affecting the potential for corrosion, including but not  limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Soil moisture content;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Soil pH;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Soil sulfides level;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Soil resistivity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Structure to soil potential;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Influence of nearby underground metal structures (e.g., piping);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Existence of stray electric current;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Existing corrosion-protection measures (e.g., coating, cathodic  protection), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The type and degree of external corrosion protection that are  needed to ensure the integrity of the tank system during the use of the  tank system or component, consisting of one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Corrosion-resistant materials of construction such as special  alloys, fiberglass reinforced plastic, etc.;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Corrosion-resistant coating (such as epoxy, fiberglass, etc.)  with cathodic protection (e.g., impressed current or sacrificial  anodes); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Electrical isolation devices such as insulating joints, flanges,  etc.</p><p class="depth5">[Note: The practices described in the National Association of  Corrosion Engineers (NACE) standard, ``Recommended Practice (RP-02-85)-- Control of External Corrosion on Metallic Buried, Partially Buried, or  Submerged Liquid Storage Systems,'' and the American Petroleum Institute  (API) Publication 1632, ``Cathodic Protection of Underground Petroleum  Storage Tanks and Piping Systems,'' may be used, where applicable, as  guidelines in providing corrosion protection for tank systems.]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For underground tank system components that are likely to be  adversely affected by vehicular traffic, a determination of design or  operational measures that will protect the tank system against potential  damage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Design considerations to ensure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tank foundations will maintain the load of a full tank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tank systems will be anchored to prevent flotation or  dislodgment where the tank system is placed in a saturated zone, or is  located within a seismic fault zone subject to the standards of  Sec. 264.18(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Tank systems will withstand the effects of frost heave.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of a new tank system must ensure that  proper handling procedures are adhered to in order to prevent damage to  the system during installation. Prior to covering, enclosing, or placing  a new tank system or component in use, an independent, qualified,  installation inspector or a qualified Professional Engineer, either of  whom is trained and experienced in the proper installation of tanks  systems or components, must inspect the system for the presence of any  of the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Weld breaks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Punctures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scrapes of protective coatings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cracks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Corrosion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other structural damage or inadequate construction/installation.  All discrepancies must be remedied before the tank system is covered,  enclosed, or placed in use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New tank systems or components that are placed underground and  that are backfilled must be provided with a backfill material that is a  noncorrosive, porous, homogeneous substance and that is installed so  that the backfill is placed completely around the tank and compacted to  ensure that the tank and piping are fully and uniformly supported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All new tanks and ancillary equipment must be tested for  tightness prior to being covered, enclosed, or placed in use. If a tank  system is found not to be tight, all repairs necessary to remedy the  leak(s) in the system must be performed prior to the tank system being  covered, enclosed, or placed into use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ancillary equipment must be supported and protected against  physical damage and excessive stress due to settlement, vibration,  expansion, or contraction.</p><p class="depth2">[Note: The piping system installation procedures described in  American Petroleum Institute (API) Publication 1615 (November 1979),  ``Installation of Underground Petroleum Storage Systems,'' or ANSI  Standard B31.3, ``Petroleum Refinery Piping,'' and ANSI Standard B31.4  ``Liquid Petroleum Transportation Piping System,'' may be used, where  applicable, as guidelines for proper installation of piping systems.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator must provide the type and degree of  corrosion protection recommended by an independent corrosion expert,  based on the information provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, or other corrosion   protection if the Regional Administrator believes other corrosion  protection is necessary to ensure the integrity of the tank system  during use of the tank system. The installation of a corrosion  protection system that is field fabricated must be supervised by an  independent corrosion expert to ensure proper installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The owner or operator must obtain and keep on file at the  facility written statements by those persons required to certify the  design of the tank system and supervise the installation of the tank  system in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f)  of this section, that attest that the tank system was properly designed  and installed and that repairs, pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (d) of  this section, were performed. These written statements must also include  the certification statement as required in Sec. 270.11(d) of this  chapter.
