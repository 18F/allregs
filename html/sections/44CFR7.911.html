                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this regulation is to set out FEMA's policies and  procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the general  governmentwide regulations, 45 CFR part 90. The Act and the general  regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or  activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the  general regulations permit federally-assisted programs or activities,  and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and  factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and its  implementing regulations.  [55 FR 23078, June 6, 1990, as amended at 68 FR 51380, Aug. 26, 2003]</p>
