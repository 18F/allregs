                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs is authorized to make grants to the States, for use by States, Indian tribal governments, units of local government and nonprofit, nongovernmental victim services programs for the purpose of developing and strengthening effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women, and to develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grantees and subgrantees shall develop a plan for implementation and shall consult and coordinate with nonprofit, nongovernmental victim services programs, including sexual assault and domestic violence victim services programs. Section 2002(c)(2). The goal of the planning process is the enhanced coordination and integration of law enforcement, prosecution, courts, probation and parole agencies, and victim services in the prevention, identification, and response to cases involving violence against women. States and localities are encouraged to include Indian tribal governments in developing their plans. States and localities should, therefore, consider the needs of Indian tribal governments in developing their law enforcement, prosecution and victims services in cases involving violence against women. Indian tribal governments may also be considered subgrantees of the State. Section 2002(a).</p>
