Except where publication of notice of proposed rule making and  public hearing is required by statute, this section shall not apply to  interpretative rules, general statements of policy, organization rules,  rules of procedure, or practice of the Administration, or amendments  thereto, or any situation in which the Administration for good cause  finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,  unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</p>
