                                Sec. 1011.21  How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offset of Presidio Trust payments to collect debts owed to other  Federal agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible  debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from  payments issued by other Federal agencies, a process known as  ``centralized offset.'' When centralized offset is not available or  appropriate, any Federal agency may ask the Presidio Trust (when acting  as a paying agency) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting  funds payable to a debtor by the Presidio Trust, including salary  payments issued to the Presidio Trust employees. This section and Sec.  1011.22 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks the Presidio  Trust to offset a payment issued by the Presidio Trust to a person who  owes a debt to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart C does not apply to the collection of debts through  tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification.  The Presidio Trust will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of  written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the  delinquent, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the  creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and  other requirements, and the creditor agency's regulations, as  applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or  otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset. Requests for  offset under this section must be sent to the Presidio Trust, ATTN:  Chief Financial Officer, P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129-0052.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Incomplete certification. The Presidio Trust will return an  incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that  the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section  before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by  the Presidio Trust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review. The Presidio Trust is not authorized to review the  merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount  or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the Presidio Trust will not comply with offset request. The  Presidio Trust will comply with the offset request of another agency  unless the Presidio Trust determines that the offset would not be in the  best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple debts. When two or more creditor agencies are seeking  offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts  are owed to a single creditor agency, the Presidio Trust may determine  the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more  debts should be collected by offset simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Priority of debts owed to the Presidio Trust. For purposes of  this section, debts owed to the Presidio Trust generally take precedence  over debts owed to other agencies. The Presidio Trust may determine  whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to  the Presidio Trust. The Presidio Trust will determine the order in which  the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United  States.</p>
