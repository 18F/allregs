                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With respect to the formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2), a  utility shall   apportion the cost of providing unusable space on a pole so that such  apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing unusable space  that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of  such costs among all attaching entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All attaching entities attached to the pole shall be counted for  purposes of apportioning the cost of unusable space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Utilities may use the following rebuttable presumptive averages  when calculating the number of attaching entities with respect to the  formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2). For non-urbanized service areas  (under 50,000 population), a presumptive average number of attaching  entities of three (3). For urbanized service areas (50,000 or higher  population), a presumptive average number of attaching entities of five  (5). If any part of the utility's service area within the state has a  designation of urbanized (50,000 or higher population) by the Bureau of  Census, United States Department of Commerce, then all of that service  area shall be designated as urbanized for purposes of determining the  presumptive average number of attaching entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A utility may establish its own presumptive average number of  attaching entities for its urbanized and non-urbanized service area as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each utility shall, upon request, provide all attaching entities  and all entities seeking access the methodology and information upon  which the utilities presumptive average number of attachers is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each utility is required to exercise good faith in establishing  and updating its presumptive average number of attachers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The presumptive average number of attachers may be challenged by  an attaching entity by submitting information demonstrating why the  utility's presumptive average is incorrect. The attaching entity should  also submit what it believes should be the presumptive average and the  methodology used. Where a complete inspection is impractical, a  statistically sound survey may be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon successful challenge of the existing presumptive average  number of attachers, the resulting data determined shall be used by the  utility as the presumptive number of attachers within the rate formula.
