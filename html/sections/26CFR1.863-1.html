                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.  See also sections 865(b) and (e)(2). In the case of sales of property  involving partners and partnerships, the rules of Sec. 1.863-3(g)  apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Natural resources--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Notwithstanding any other  provision, except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, gross receipts from the sale outside the United States of  products derived from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil  or gas well, other natural deposit, or timber within the United States,  must be allocated between sources within and without the United States  based on the fair market value of the product at the export terminal (as  defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section). Notwithstanding any  other provision, except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section, gross receipts from the sale within the United States of  products derived from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil  or gas well, other natural deposit, or timber outside the United States  must be allocated between sources within and without the United States  based on the fair market value of the product at the export terminal.  For place of sale, see Sec. Sec. 1.861-7(c) and 1.863-3(c)(2). The  source of gross receipts equal to the fair market value of the product  at the export terminal will be from sources where the farm, mine, well,  deposit, or uncut timber is located. The source of gross receipts from  the sale of the product in excess of its fair market value at the export  terminal (excess gross receipts) will be determined as follows--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the taxpayer engages in additional production activities  subsequent to shipment from the export terminal and outside the country  of sale, the source of excess gross receipts must be determined under  Sec. 1.863-3. For purposes of applying Sec. 1.863-3, only production  assets used in additional production activity subsequent to the export  terminal are taken into account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> applies to a  taxpayer that engages in additional production activities in the country  of sale, as well as to a taxpayer that does not engage in additional  production activities at all.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional production prior to export terminal. Notwithstanding  any other provision of this section, gross receipts from the sale of  products derived by a taxpayer who performs additional production  activities as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section before the  relevant product is shipped from the export terminal are allocated  between sources within and without the United States based on the fair  market value of the product immediately prior to the additional  production activities. The source of gross receipts equal to the fair  market value of the product immediately prior to the additional  production activities will be from sources where the farm, mine,   well, deposit, or uncut timber is located. The source of gross receipts  from the sale of the product in excess of the fair market value  immediately prior to the additional production activities must be  determined under Sec. 1.863-3. For purposes of applying Sec. 1.863-3,  only production assets used in the additional production activities are  taken into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Production activity. For purposes of this  section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates,  manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages inventory. See Sec.  1.864-1. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13 or 1.863- 3(g)(2), only production activities conducted directly by the taxpayer  are taken into account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional production activities. For purposes of this section,  additional production activities are substantial production activities  performed directly by the taxpayer in addition to activities from the  ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural  deposit, or timber. Whether a taxpayer's activities constitute  additional production activities will be determined under the principles  of Sec. 1.954-3(a)(4). However, in no case will activities that prepare  the natural resource itself for export, including those that are  designed to facilitate the transportation of the natural resource to or  from the export terminal, be considered additional production activities  for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Export terminal. Where the farm, mine, well, deposit, or uncut  timber is located without the United States, the export terminal will be  the final point in a foreign country from which goods are shipped to the  United States. If there is no such final point in a foreign country  (e.g., the property is extracted and produced on the high seas), the  export terminal will be the place of production. Where the farm, mine,  well, deposit, or uncut timber is located within the United States, the  export terminal will be the final point in the United States from which  goods are shipped from the United States to a foreign country. The  location of the export terminal is determined without regard to any  contractual terms agreed to by the taxpayer and without regard to  whether there is an actual sale of the products at the export terminal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determination of fair market value. For purposes of this  section, fair market value depends on all of the facts and circumstances  as they exist relative to a party in any particular case. Where the  products are sold to a related party in a transaction subject to section  482, the determination of fair market value under this section must be  consistent with the arm's length price determined under section 482.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determination of gross income. To determine the amount of a  taxpayer's gross income from sources within or without the United  States, the taxpayer's gross receipts from sources within or without the  United States determined under this paragraph (b) must be reduced by the  cost of goods sold properly attributable to gross receipts from sources  within or without the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Tax return disclosure. A taxpayer that determines the source of  its income under this paragraph (b) shall attach a statement to its  return explaining the methodology used to determine fair market value  under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and explaining any additional  production activities (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this  section) performed by the taxpayer. In addition, the taxpayer must  provide such other information as is required by Sec. 1.863-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. No additional production. U.S. Mines, a U.S. corporation,  operates a copper mine and mill in country X. U.S. Mines extracts  copper-bearing rocks from the ground and transports the rocks to the  mill where the rocks are ground and processed to produce copper-bearing  concentrate. The concentrate is transported to a port where it is dried  in preparation for export, stored and then shipped to purchasers in the  United States. Because title to the property is passed in the United  States and, under the facts and circumstances, none of U.S. Mine's  activities constitutes additional production prior to the export  terminal within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section,  under paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section, gross receipts  equal to the fair market value of the concentrate at the export terminal  will be from sources without the United States, and excess gross  receipts   will be from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. No additional production. US Gas, a U.S. corporation,  extracts natural gas within the United States, and transports the  natural gas to a U.S. port where it is liquified in preparation for  shipment. The liquified natural gas is then transported via freighter  and sold without additional production activities in a foreign country.  Liquefaction of natural gas is not an additional production activity  because liquefaction prepares the natural gas for transportation from  the export terminal. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(1)(ii) of  this section, gross receipts equal to the fair market value of the  liquefied natural gas at the export terminal will be from sources within  the United States, and excess gross receipts will be from sources  without the United States.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Sale in third country. US Gold, a U.S. corporation, mines  gold in country X, produces gold jewelry in the United States, and sells  the jewelry in country Y. Assume that the fair market value of the gold  at the export terminal in country X is $40, and that US Gold ultimately  sells the gold jewelry in country Y for $100. Under Sec. 1.863-1(b),  $40 of US Gold's gross receipts will be allocated to sources without the  United States. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the source of  the remaining $60 of gross receipts will be determined under Sec.  1.863-3. If US Gold applies the 50/50 method described in Sec. 1.863-3,  $20 of cost of goods sold is properly attributable to activities  subsequent to the export terminal, and all of US Gold's production  assets subsequent to the export terminal are located in the United  States, then $20 of gross income will be allocated to sources within the  United States and $20 of gross income will be allocated to sources  without the United States.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Production in country of sale. US Oil, a U.S.  corporation, extracts oil in country X, transports the oil via pipeline  to the export terminal in country Y, refines the oil in the United  States, and sells the refined product in the United States to unrelated  persons. Assume that the fair market value of the oil at the export  terminal in country Y is $80, and that US Oil ultimately sells the  refined product for $100. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, $80 of  US Oil's gross receipts will be allocated to sources without the United  States, and under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section the remaining $20  of gross receipts will be allocated to sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. Additional production prior to export. The facts are the  same as in Example 1, except that U.S. Mines also operates a smelter in  country X. The concentrate output from the mill is transported to the  smelter where it is transformed into smelted copper. The smelted copper  is exported to purchasers in the United States. Under the facts and  circumstances, all of the processes applied to make copper concentrate  are considered mining. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, gross receipts equal to the fair market value of the  concentrate at the smelter will be from sources without the United  States. Under the facts and circumstances, the conversion of the  concentrate into smelted copper is an additional production activity in  a foreign country within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this  section. Therefore, the source of U.S. Mine's excess gross receipts will  be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of taxable income. The taxpayer's taxable income  from sources within or without the United States will be determined  under the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T for determining  taxable income from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In general. This paragraph (d) applies to scholarships, fellowship  grants, grants, prizes and awards. The provisions of this paragraph (d)  do not apply to amounts paid as salary or other compensation for  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Source of income. The source of income from scholarships,  fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> United States source income. Except as provided in paragraph  (d)(2)(iii) of this section, scholarships, fellowship grants, grants,  prizes and awards made by a U.S. citizen or resident, a domestic  partnership, a domestic corporation, an estate or trust (other than a  foreign estate or trust within the meaning of section 7701(a)(31)), the  United States (or an instrumentality or agency thereof), a State (or any  political subdivision thereof), or the District of Columbia shall be  treated as income from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign source income. Scholarships, fellowship grants, grants,  prizes and awards made by a foreign government (or an instrumentality,  agency, or any political subdivision thereof), an international  organization (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)), or a person other than  a U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) shall be treated as  income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Certain activities conducted outside the United States.  Scholarships, fellowship grants, targeted grants, and achievement awards  received by a person other than a U.S. person (as defined in section  7701(a)(30)) with respect to activities previously conducted (in the  case of achievement awards) or to be conducted (in the case of  scholarships, fellowships grants, and targeted grants) outside the  United States shall be treated as income from sources without the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scholarships are defined in section 117 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fellowship grants are defined in section 117 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Prizes and awards are defined in section 74 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Grants are amounts described in subparagraph (3) of section  4945(g) and the regulations thereunder, and are not amounts otherwise  described in paragraphs (d)(3) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. For  purposes of this paragraph (d), the reference to section 4945(g)(3) is  applied without regard to the identity of the payor or recipient and  without the application of the objective and nondiscriminatory basis  test and the requirement of a procedure approved in advance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Targeted grants are grants--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Issued by an organization described in section 501(c)(3), the  United States (or an instrumentality or agency thereof), a State (or any  political subdivision thereof), or the District of Columbia; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For an activity undertaken in the public interest and not  primarily for the private financial benefit of a specific person or  persons or organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Achievement awards are awards--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Issued by an organization described in section 501(c)(3), the  United States (or an instrumentality or agency thereof), a State (or  political subdivision thereof), or the District of Columbia; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For a past activity undertaken in the public interest and not  primarily for the private financial benefit of a specific person or  persons or organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective dates. The following are the effective dates  concerning this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> and (ii) of this  section may be applied without applying paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Grants, prizes and awards.
