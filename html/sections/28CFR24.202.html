                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant except a qualified tax exempt organization or a  qualified cooperative must submit with its application a detailed  exhibit showing its net worth at the time the proceeding was initiated.  If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly or indirectly  controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of  the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or  controls a majority of the voting shares of other interest of any  corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the  net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant including the  affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant,  provided that it makes full disclosure of the applicant's and any  affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine  whether the applicant qualifies under the standards of 5 U.S.C.  504(b)(1)(B)(i). The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to  file additional information to determine the applicant's eligibility for  an award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets  from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate,  occurring in the one-year period prior to the date on which the  proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant  and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were  no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The net worth exhibit shall be included in the public record of  the proceeding.</p>
