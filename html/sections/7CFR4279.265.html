Upon receipt of a complete Phase 1 application, the Agency will determine if the Borrower, Lender, and Project are eligible and if the Project is technically and economically feasible, as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Borrower, Lender, or the Project is determined to be ineligible for any reason, the Agency will inform the Lender, in writing, of the reasons. No further evaluation of the application will occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency determines it is unable to guarantee the loan, the Agency will inform the Lender in writing. Such notification will include the reasons for denial of the guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Technical and economic feasibility. (1) The Agency's determination of a Project's technical and economic feasibility will be based on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Agency's analysis of the technical report and Feasibility Study submitted in the application conducted by qualified independent third parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Lenders credit evaluation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other application materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Agency's determination of a Project's technical feasibility will be based on the technical report. In addition, prior to loan closing of a Project utilizing technology that does not have a history of successful utilization in a Commercial-Scale operation of a Biorefinery that produces an Advanced Biofuel, evidence demonstrating 120 days of continuous, steady state production from an integrated demonstration unit must be provided by the Borrower to the Lender and the Agency for review and determination of technical feasibility. Authoritative demonstration campaign results must be provided in 30-day intervals. The integrated demonstration unit must prove out the Project's ability to utilize Project-relevant biomass and produce Advanced Biofuel at a yield and quality consistent with the design basis of the Project. The Borrower must provide to the Agency, for review and approval, sufficient information on the integrated campaign design so as to ensure operation duration, quality, and quantity specifications are met and incorporated into the final design criteria for the commercial facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Projects determined by the Agency to be without technical or economic feasibility will not be selected for funding.</p>
