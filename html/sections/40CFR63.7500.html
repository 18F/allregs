The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per million Btu of steam output, in Tables 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers and process heaters that generate steam. The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per megawatt-hour, in Tables 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers that generate electricity. If you operate a new boiler or process heater, you can choose to comply with alternative limits as discussed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) of this section, but on or after January 31, 2016, you must comply with the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction after June 4, 2010 and before May 20, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 11 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction after May 20, 2011 and before December 23, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 12 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction after December 23, 2011 and

If you use a control device or combination of control devices not covered in Table 4 to this subpart, or you wish to establish and monitor an alternative operating limit or an alternative monitoring parameter, you must apply to the EPA Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under Sec. 63.8(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source (as defined in Sec. 63.7490), including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), EPA may approve use of an alternative to the work practice standards in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited-use boilers and process heaters must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in Sec. 63.7540. They are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, the annual tune-up, or the energy assessment requirements in Table 3 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Boilers and process heaters with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour in the units designed to burn gas 2 (other) fuels subcategory or units designed to burn light liquid fuels subcategory must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in Sec. 63.7540.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in Sec. 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity greater than 5 million Btu per hour and less than 10 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 2 years as specified in Sec. 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> These standards apply at all times the affected unit is operating, except during periods of startup and shutdown during which time you must comply only with Table 3 to this subpart.
