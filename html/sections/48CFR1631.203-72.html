                            <p class="depth0">A carrier's practices for allocating home office expenses to the  segments of the carrier will be acceptable for purposes of FAR 31.203 if  they are allocated on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship  between the home office activities and the segments to which the  expenses are allocated. Expenses that cannot be allocated on the basis  of a more specific beneficial or causal relationship should be allocated  on a basis representative of the entire activity being managed. The  compliance of such allocations with FAR 31.203 shall be determined on  the basis of the facts and circumstances of each situation.  [70 FR 31391, June 1, 2005]</p>
