                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This subchapter concerns a program administered by APHIS to accredit veterinarians and thereby authorize them to perform, on behalf of APHIS, certain activities specified in this chapter. This program is intended to ensure that an adequate number of qualified veterinarians are available in the United States to perform such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Categories of accreditation. A veterinarian may be accredited as a Category I veterinarian or a Category II veterinarian. A veterinarian who is accredited under Category I is only authorized to perform accredited duties on Category I animals, as defined in Sec. 160.1. A veterinarian who is accredited under Category II is authorized to perform accredited duties on both Category I animals and Category II animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application for initial accreditation. A veterinarian may apply for accreditation by completing an application for accreditation and submitting it to APHIS. In completing the application, the veterinarian will choose one of the accreditation activity categories, either Category I or Category II, as discussed in paragraph (b) of this section. Applications for Category I accreditation must include certification that the applicant is able to perform the tasks listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Applications for Category II accreditation must include certification that the applicant is able to perform the tasks listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. An accredited veterinarian must not perform duties requiring a program certification unless he or she is accredited under Category II and qualified to perform such duties in accordance with Sec. 161.5 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Review of application. Applications for accreditation received by APHIS shall be forwarded to the State Animal Health Official for the State in which the veterinarian wishes to perform accredited duties for approval. Within 14 days after receiving an application, a State Animal Health Official shall either endorse the application or send a

written statement to the Administrator explaining why it was not endorsed; but if the State Animal Health Official fails to take one of these actions within 14 days, APHIS shall proceed to review the application. The Administrator will review the application and the written statement, if any, and determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for accreditation contained in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Accreditation requirements. The Administrator is hereby authorized to accredit a veterinarian when he or she determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The veterinarian is a graduate with a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine or an equivalent degree (any degree that qualifies the holder to be licensed by a State to practice veterinary medicine) from a college of veterinary medicine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The veterinarian is licensed or legally able to practice veterinary medicine in the State in which the veterinarian wishes to perform accredited duties. APHIS will confirm the licensing status of the applicant by contacting the State board of veterinary medical examiners or any similar State organization that maintains records of veterinarians licensed in a State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The veterinarian has completed initial accreditation training, using content provided by APHIS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The veterinarian has completed an orientation program approved by the Veterinarian-in-Charge for the State in which the veterinarian wishes to perform accredited duties, and upon completion of the orientation, has signed a written statement listing the date and place of orientation, the subjects covered in the orientation, and any written materials provided to the veterinarian at the orientation. The Veterinarian-in-Charge shall also give the State Animal Health Official an opportunity to review the contents of the orientation, and invite him or her to participate in developing orientation materials and conducting the orientation. The veterinarian applying for accreditation must have completed the orientation program within 3 years prior to submitting the application for accreditation. The core orientation program shall include the following topics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Federal animal health laws, regulations, and rules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interstate movement requirements for animals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Import and export requirements for animals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> USDA animal disease eradication and control programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Laboratory support in confirming disease diagnoses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ethical and professional responsibilities of an accredited veterinarian;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Foreign animal disease awareness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Animal health emergency management; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Animal health procedures, issues, and information resources relevant to the State in which the veterinarian wishes to perform accredited duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Change in accreditation category-- (1) Category I to Category II. A veterinarian who is accredited under Category I may become accredited under Category II if the veterinarian applies for accreditation under Category II by completing an application for accreditation, including certification that the applicant is able to perform the tasks listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, and submitting it to APHIS. The veterinarian must also have fulfilled the training requirements in Sec. 161.3(b) that are associated with renewal of accreditation under Category II.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Category II to Category I. A veterinarian who is accredited under Category II may become accredited under Category I if the veterinarian applies for accreditation under Category I by completing an application for accreditation, including certification that the applicant is able to perform the tasks listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and submitting it to APHIS. The veterinarian must also have fulfilled the training requirements in Sec. 161.3(b) that are associated with renewal of accreditation under Category I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Tasks that applicants for accredited status must be able to perform.
