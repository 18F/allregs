                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Concentrations of airborne dust in the test space shall be  determined by sampling with a midget impinger apparatus, and a light- field microscopic technique shall be employed in determining  concentrations of dust in terms of millions of particles (5 microns or  less in diameter) per cubic foot of air sampled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before a drilling test is started the surfaces of the test space  shall be wetted; the test space shall be cleared of air-borne dust  insofar as practicable by mechanical ventilation or other means; and an  atmospheric sample, designated as a control sample, shall be collected  during a 5-minute period to determine residual airborne dust in the test  space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A sample of airborne dust, designated as a test sample, shall be  collected in the breathing zone of the drill operators during the  drilling of each test hole. Time consumed in changing drill steel shall  not be considered as drilling time and sampling shall be discontinued  during such periods.
