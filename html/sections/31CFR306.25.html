                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Securities, whether in registered or bearer form, are  payable in regular course of business at maturity unless called for  redemption before maturity in accordance with their terms, in which case  they will be payable in regular course of business on the date of call.  The Secretary of the Treasury may provide for the exchange of maturing  or called securities, or in advance of call or maturity, may afford  owners the opportunity of exchanging a security for another security  pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer. Registered and  bearer securities should be presented and surrendered for redemption to  the Bureau. No assignments or evidence in support of assignments will be  required by or on behalf of the registered owner or assignee for  redemption for his or its account, or for redemption-exchange, or  exchange pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer, if  the new securities are to be registered in exactly the same names and  forms as appear in the registrations or assignments of the securities  surrendered. To the extent appropriate, these rules also apply to  securities registered in the title of public officers who are official  custodians of public funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Overdue'' securities. If a bearer security or a registered  security assigned in blank, or to bearer, or so assigned as to become in  effect payable to bearer, is presented and surrendered for redemption  after it has become overdue, the Secretary of the Treasury will  ordinarily require satisfactory proof of ownership. (Form PD 1071 may be  used.) A security shall be considered to be overdue after the lapse of  the following periods of time from its face maturity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One month for securities issued for a term of 1 year or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three months for securities issued for a term of more than 1  year but not in excess of 7 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Six months for securities issued for a term of more than 7  years.
