If you intend to burn a new type of fuel or fuel mixture that does

not meet the requirements of this paragraph, you must conduct a performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For new or reconstructed affected boilers that have applicable work practice standards or management practices, you are not required to complete an initial performance tune-up, but you are required to complete the applicable biennial or 5-year tune-up as specified in Sec. 63.11223 no later than 25 months or 61 months, respectively, after the initial startup of the new or reconstructed affected source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For affected boilers that ceased burning solid waste consistent with Sec. 63.11196(d) and for which your initial compliance date has passed, you must demonstrate compliance within 60 days of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch as specified in Sec. 60.2145(a)(2) and (3) of subpart CCCC or Sec. 60.2710(a)(2) and (3) of subpart DDDD. If you have not conducted your compliance demonstration for this subpart within the previous 12 months, you must complete all compliance demonstrations for this subpart before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For affected boilers that switch fuels or make a physical change to the boiler that results in the applicability of a different subcategory within subpart JJJJJJ or the boiler becoming subject to subpart JJJJJJ, you must demonstrate compliance within 180 days of the effective date of the fuel switch or the physical change. Notification of such changes must be submitted according to Sec. 63.11225(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> For boilers located at existing major sources of HAP that limit their potential to emit (e.g., make a physical change or take a permit limit) such that the existing major source becomes an area source, you must comply with the applicable provisions as specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any such existing boiler at the existing source must demonstrate compliance with subpart JJJJJJ within 180 days of the later of March 21, 2014 or upon the existing major source commencing operation as an area source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any new or reconstructed boiler at the existing source must demonstrate compliance with subpart JJJJJJ within 180 days of the later of March 21, 2011 or startup.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of such changes must be submitted according to Sec. 63.11225(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For existing affected boilers that have not operated between the effective date of the rule and the compliance date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.11196, you must comply with the applicable provisions as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must complete the initial compliance demonstration, if subject to the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected boiler and according to the applicable provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must complete the initial performance tune-up, if subject to the tune-up requirements in Sec. 63.11223, by following the procedures described in Sec. 63.11223(b) no later than 30 days after the re-start of the affected boiler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must complete the one-time energy assessment, if subject to the energy assessment requirements specified in Table 2 to this subpart, no later than the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.11196.
