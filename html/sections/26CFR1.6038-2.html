                                Sec. 1.6038-2  Information returns required of United States persons corporations beginning after December 31, 1962.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of return. Every U.S. person shall make a separate  annual information return with respect to each annual accounting period  (described in paragraph (e) of this section) beginning after December  31, 1962, of each foreign corporation which that person controls (as  defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for an uninterrupted period of  30 days or more during such annual accounting period. Such information  shall not be required to be furnished, however, with respect to a  corporation defined in section 1504(d) of the Code which makes a  consolidated return for the taxable year. The return shall be made, with  respect to annual accounting periods ending with or within the United  States person's taxable year, on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form 2952, ``Information Return with Respect to Controlled  Foreign Corporations,'' if such taxable year ends before December 31,  1982;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form 5471, ``Information Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to  Certain Foreign Corporations,'' if such taxable year ends on or after  December 31, 1983; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Either Form 5471 or Form 2952 if such taxable year ends on or  after December 31, 1982 and before December 31, 1963.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Control. A person shall be deemed to be in control of a foreign  corporation if at any time during that person's taxable year it owns  stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power  of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the  total value of shares of all classes of stock of the foreign  corporation. A person in control of a corporation which, in turn, owns  more than 50 percent of the combined voting power, or of the value, of  all classes of stock of another corporation is also treated as being in  control of such other corporation. The provisions of this paragraph may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation A owns 51 percent of the voting stock in  Corporation B. Corporation B owns 51 percent of the voting stock in  Corporation C. Corporation C in turn owns 51 percent of the voting stock  in Corporation D. Corporation D is controlled by Corporation A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Attribution rules. For the purpose of determining control of  domestic or foreign corporations the constructive ownership rules of  section 318(a) shall apply except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stock owned by or for a partner or a beneficiary of an estate or  trust shall not be considered owned by the partnership, estate, or trust  when the effect is to consider a United States person as owning stock  owned by a person who is not a United States person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A corporation will not be considered as owning stock owned by or  for a 50 percent or more shareholder when the effect is to consider a  United States person as owning stock owned by a person who is not a  United States person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If 10 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is  owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, section  318(a)(2)(C) shall apply.   The constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) apply only for  purposes of determining control as defined in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> U.S. person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6038 and  this section, the term United States person has the meaning assigned to  it by section 7701(a)(30), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and  (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for individuals residing in certain possessions.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to an individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto  Rico, the term United States person has the meaning assigned to it by  Sec. 1.957-3 except that the rules of Sec. 1.937-2(g)(1) will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to an individual who is a bona fide resident of  any section 931 possession, as defined in Sec. 1.931-1(c)(1), the term  United States person has the meaning assigned to it by Sec. 1.957-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain nonresident aliens. An individual for  whom an election under section 6013(g) or (h) is in effect will, subject  to the exceptions contained in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be  considered a United States person for purposes of section 6038 and this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Period covered by return. The information required under  paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section with respect to a foreign  corporation shall be furnished for the annual accounting period of the  foreign corporation ending with or within the United States person's  taxable year. For purposes of this section, the annual accounting period  of a foreign corporation is the annual period on the basis of which that  corporation regularly computes its income in keeping its books. In the  case of a specified foreign corporation (as defined in section 898), the  taxable year of such corporation shall be treated as its annual  accounting period. The term annual accounting period may refer to a  period of less than one year, where, for example, the foreign income,  war profits, and excess profits taxes are determined on the basis of an  accounting period of less than one year as described in section  902(c)(5). If more than one annual accounting period ends with or within  the United States person's taxable year, separate annual information  returns shall be submitted for each annual accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Contents of return. The return on Form 5471 shall contain so  much of the following information, and in such form or manner, as the  form shall prescribe with respect to each foreign corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and employer identification number, if any,  of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The principal place of business of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The date of incorporation and the country under whose laws  incorporated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the foreign corporation's statutory or  resident agent in the country of incorporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The name, address, and identifying number of any branch office  or agent of the foreign corporation located in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The name and address of the person (or persons) having custody  of the books of account and records of the foreign corporation, and the  location of such books and records if different from such address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The nature of the corporation's business and the principal  places where conducted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> As regards the outstanding stock of the corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of each class of the corporation's stock, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The number of shares of each class outstanding at the beginning  and end of the annual accounting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A list showing the name, address, and identifying number of, and  the number of shares of each class of the corporation's stock held by,  each United States person who is a shareholder owning at any time during  the annual accounting period 5 percent or more in value of any class of  the corporation's outstanding stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> For the annual accounting period, the amount of the  corporation's:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Current earnings and profits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or  accrued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distributions out of current earnings and profits for the  period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Distributions other than those described in paragraph  (f)(10)(iii) of this section and the source thereof; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For Forms 5471 filed for taxable years ending after December 15,  1990, such earnings and profits information as the form shall prescribe,  including post-1986 undistributed earnings described in section  902(c)(1), pre-1987 amounts, total earnings and profits, and previously  taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Transactions with certain related parties. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A summary  showing the total amount of each of the following types of transactions  of the corporation, which took place during the annual accounting  period, with the person required to file this return, any other  corporation or partnership controlled by that person, or any United  States person owning at the time of the transaction 10 percent or more  in value of any class of stock outstanding of the foreign corporation,  or of any corporation controlling that foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sales and purchases of stock in trade;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sales and purchases of tangible property other than stock in  trade;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sales and purchases of patents, inventions, models, or designs  (whether or not patented), copyrights, trademarks, secret formulas or  processes, or any other similar property rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Compensation paid and compensation received for the rendition of  technical, managerial, engineering, construction, scientific, or like  services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Commissions paid and commissions received;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Rents and royalties paid and rents and royalties received;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Amounts loaned and amounts borrowed (except open accounts  resulting from sales and purchases reported under other items listed in  this paragraph (f)(11) that arise and are collected in full in the  ordinary course of business);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Dividends paid and dividends received;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Interest paid and interest received; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Premiums paid and premiums received for insurance or  reinsurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for banks. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(11),  if the United States person is a bank, as defined in section 581, or is  controlled within the meaning of section 368(c) by a bank, the term  transactions shall not, as to a corporation with respect to which a  return is filed, include banking transactions entered into on behalf of  customers; in any event, however, deposits in accounts between a foreign  corporation, controlled (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this  section) by a United States person, and a person described in this  paragraph (f)(11) and withdrawals from such accounts shall be summarized  by reporting end-of-month balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Accrued payments and receipts. For purposes of the required  summary under paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a corporation that uses  an accrual method of accounting shall use accrued payments and accrued  receipts for purposes of computing the total amount of each of the types  of transactions listed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Financial statements. The following information with respect to  the foreign corporation shall be attached to and filed as part of the  return required by this section. Forms 5471 filed after September 30,  1991, shall contain this information in such form or manner as   the form shall prescribe with respect to each foreign corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the corporation's profit and loss for the annual  accounting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A balance sheet as of the end of the annual accounting period of  the corporation showing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The corporation's asset;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The corporation's liabilities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The corporation's net worth; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An analysis of changes in the corporation's surplus accounts  during the annual accounting period including both opening and closing  balances.

Amounts furnished under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall also be  furnished in the foreign corporation's functional currency as required  on the form.

Returns on Form 5471 required  under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed with the United  States person's income tax return on or before the date required by law  for the filing of that person's income tax return. Directors of Field  Operations and Field Directors are authorized to grant reasonable  extensions of time for filing returns on Form 5471 in accordance with  the applicable provisions of Sec. 1.6081-1 of this chapter. An  application for an extension of time for filing a return of income shall  also be considered as an application for an extension of time for filing  returns on Form 5471.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Two or more persons required to submit the same information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Return jointly made. If two or more persons are required to furnish  information with respect to the same foreign corporation for the same  period, such persons may, in lieu of making separate returns, jointly  make one return. Such joint return shall be filed with the income tax  return of any one of the persons making such joint return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Persons excepted from furnishing information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conditions.  Any person required to furnish information under this section with  respect to a foreign corporation need not furnish that information  provided all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such person does not directly own an interest in the foreign  corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such person is required to furnish the information solely by  reason of attribution of stock ownership from a United States person  under paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The person from whom the stock ownership is attributed furnishes  all of the information required under this section of the person to whom  the stock ownership is attributed. (For a rule regarding attribution  from a nonresident alien, see paragraph (l) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an individual who is a United States person required to  furnish information with respect to a foreign corporation under section  6038 is entitled under a treaty to be treated as a nonresident of the  United States, and if the individual claims this treaty benefit, and if  there are no other United States persons that are required to furnish  information under section 6038 with respect to the foreign corporation,  then the individual may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (f)(10),  (f)(11), (g), and (h) of this section by filing the audited foreign  financial statements of the foreign corporation with the individual's  return required under section 6038.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustrations. The rule of this paragraph (j)(2) is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a U.S. person owns 100 percent of the stock of M, a  domestic corporation. A also owns 100 percent of the stock of N, a  foreign corporation organized under the laws of foreign country Y. A, in  filing the information return required by this section with respect to N  Corporation, in fact furnishes all of the information required of M  Corporation with respect to N Corporation. M Corporation need not file  the information.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X, a domestic corporation owns 100 percent of the stock  of Y, a domestic corporation, Y Corporation owns 100 percent of the  stock of Z, a foreign corporation. X Corporation is not excused by this  paragraph (j)(2) from filing information with respect to Z Corporation  because X Corporation is deemed to control Z Corporation under the  provisions of paragraph (b) of this section without recourse to the  attribution rules in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Failure to furnish information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dollar amount penalty--(i)  In general. If any person required to file Form 5471 under section 6038  and this section fails to furnish any information described in  paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section within the time prescribed by  paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, such person shall pay a penalty of  $10,000 for each annual accounting period of each foreign corporation  with respect to which such failure occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> shall be  limited to a maximum of $50,000 for each failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Penalty of reducing foreign tax credit--(i) Effect on foreign  tax credit. Failure of a United States person to furnish, in accordance  with the provisions of this section, any return or any information in  any return, required to be filed for a taxable year under authority of  section 6038 on or before the date prescribed in paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section may affect the application of section 901 as provided in  paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section and may affect the application of  sections 902 and 960 as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this  section. Such failure may affect the application of sections 902 and 960  to any such United States person which is a corporation or to any person  who acquires from any other person any portion (but only to the extent  of such portion) of the interest of such other person in any such  foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of sections 902 and 960. In the application of  sections 902 and 960 to a United States person referred to in paragraph  (k)(2)(i) of this section for any taxable year, the amount of   taxes paid or deemed paid by each foreign corporation for the accounting  period or periods for which such person was required for the taxable  year of the failure to furnish information under this section may be  reduced by 10 percent. The 10-percent reduction is not limited to the  taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation with respect to  which there is a failure to file information but may apply to the taxes  paid or deemed paid by all foreign corporations controlled by that  person. In applying subsections (a) and (b) of section 902, and in  applying subsection (a) of section 960, the reduction provided by this  paragraph (k)(2) shall not apply for purposes of determining the amount  of accumulated profits in excess of income, war profits, and excess  profits taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reduction for continued failure after notice. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the  failure referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section continues for  more than 90 days after the date on which the Director of Field  Operations mails notice of such failure to such United States person,  then the amount of the reduction referred to in paragraphs (k)(2) (ii)  and (iii) of this section may be 10 percent plus an additional 5 percent  for each 3-month period, or fraction thereof, during which such failure  continues after the expiration of such 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No taxes shall be reduced under this paragraph (k)(2) more than  once for the same failure. Taxes paid by a foreign corporation when once  reduced for a failure shall not be reduced again for the same failure in  their status as taxes deemed paid by a corporate shareholder. Where a  failure continues, each additional periodic 5-percent reduction,  referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, shall be  considered as part of the one reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Limitation on reduction of foreign tax credit. The amount of the  reduction under this paragraph (k)(2) for each failure to furnish  information with respect to a foreign corporation as required under this  section shall not exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $10,000, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The income of the foreign corporation for its annual accounting  period with respect to which the failure occurs. For purposes of this  section if a person is required to furnish information with respect to  more than one foreign corporation, controlled (within the meaning of  paragraph (b) of this section) by that person, each failure to submit  information for each such corporation constitutes a separate failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em>,  may be made under this paragraph (k)(2) with respect to any separate  failure, shall not exceed the maximum amount of such reductions which  may be imposed, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the dollar  amount penalty imposed by paragraph (k)(1) of this section with respect  to such separate failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable cause. (i) For purposes of section 6038 (b) and (c)  and this section, the time prescribed for furnishing information under  paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, and the beginning of the 90-day period  after mailing of notice by the Director of Field Operations under  paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (2)(iv)(A) of this section, shall be treated  as being not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed  for failure to furnish the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To show that reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish  information as required by section 6038 and this section, the person  required to report such information must make an affirmative showing of  all facts alleged as reasonable cause for such failure in a written  statement containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties  of prejury. The statement must be filed with the district director for  the district or the director of the service center where the return is  required to be filed. The district director or the director of the  service center shall determine whether the failure to furnish  information was due to reasonable cause, and if so, the period of time  for which such reasonable cause existed. In the case of a return that  has been filed as required by this section except for an omission of, or  error with respect to, some of the information required, if the person  who filed the return establishes to the satisfaction of the district  director or the director of the service   center that the person has substantially complied with this section,  then the omission or error shall not constitute a failure under this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other penalties. The information required by section 6038 and  this section must be furnished even though there are no foreign taxes  which would be reduced under the provisions of this section, and even  though the information required may not affect the amount of any tax due  under the Internal Revenue Code. For criminal penalties for failure to  file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections  7203, 7206, and 7207 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Illustrations. The provisions of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gains, profits, and income of N........................     $100,000 (b) Foreign tax paid by N with respect to such gains,             40,000</p><p class="depth0">profits, and income.......................................

This example illustrates that the  reductions in foreign taxes paid by the foreign corporation provided  under section 8038(c) are taken into account in determining the amount  included in gross income of the domestic corporation under section 78 of  the Code as foreign taxes deemed paid, but such reductions are not taken  into account in computing accumulated profits for purposes of  determining the portion of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to a  particular dividend. The dollar amount penalty imposed by section 8038  (b) and paragraph (k)(1) of this section does not apply with respect to  information for annual accounting periods ending before September 4,  1982, and therefore does not apply to M with respect to M's failure to  file Form 2952 in this example.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that all  of the events occur in or with respect to the 1982 taxable year. On  March 15, 1983. M filed its income tax return and paid its income tax,  but M did not file Form 2952 or Form 5471 with respect to N's 1982  annual accounting period. On June 1, 1983, the district director mailed  notice to M of M's failure to file Form 2952 or Form 5471 with respect  to N. On November 30, 1983, M filed a complete Form 5471 with respect to  N's 1982 annual accounting period. Under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this  section, M is subject to a penalty of $1,000. Under paragraph (k)(1)(ii)  of this section, that penalty is increased by $4,000 because the failure  continued for 92 days (three full 30-day periods and a fraction of a  fourth 30-day period) after the end of the 90-day period following  mailing of the notice by the district director, bringing M's dollar  amount penalty under paragraph (k)(1) of this section to $5,000. For  purpose of determining the foreign tax credit available to M, there may  be imposed a reduction of foreign tax paid by N of $6,000, which would  be the total of reductions under paragraph (k)(2) of this section with  respect to M's failure to file under section 6038 for N's 1982 annual  accounting period, before application of paragraph (k)(2)(vi) of this  section. Under said paragraph (k)(2)(vi), the amount of the foreign tax  reduction imposed is reduced by   the amount of the dollar amount penalty, leaving a foreign tax reduction  penalty of $1,000 which may be imposed in addition to the $5,000 dollar  amount penalty. If imposed, the $1,000 tax reduction would then be  applied in the calculation of taxes deemed paid by M under section 902  as in example (1), items (c), (d), and (h).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A, a U.S. person, owns 100 percent of the stock of FC. On  April 15, 2008, A timely filed its 2007 income tax return but did not  file Form 5471 with respect to FC's 2007 annual accounting period. On  June 1, 2008, the Director of Field Operations mailed a notice to A of  A's failure to file Form 5471 for 2007 with respect to FC. On August 1,  2008, A submits a written statement asserting facts for reasonable cause  for failure to file the 2007 Form 5471 for FC. Based on A's statement  and discussions with A, the Director of Field Operations agrees that A  had reasonable cause for failure to file FC's 2007 Form 5471 and  determined that it is reasonable for A to file FC's 2007 Form 5471 by  September 15, 2008. The time prescribed for furnishing information under  paragraph (i) of this section is September 15, 2008, and the 90-day  period described under paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this  section begins on that same date. Thus, if A files a completed Form 5471  by September 15, 2008, A is not subject to the penalties under  paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. If A does not file a  completed Form 5471 by December 14, 2008, in addition to the penalties  under paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, A will also be  subject to the penalties for continued failure under paragraphs  (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 except A submits  the written statement to the Director before a notice of failure to  furnish information is mailed to A. The notice is mailed to A on  September 7, 2008. Under these facts, the time prescribed for furnishing  information under paragraph (i) of this section is September 15, 2008,  and the 90-day period after mailing of notice of failure under  paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section begins on that  same date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Other persons excepted from filing.
