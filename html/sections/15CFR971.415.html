Sec. 971.406 and  971.417, each commercial recovery permit will be issued for a period of  20 years and for so long thereafter as hard mineral resources   are recovered annually in commercial quantities from the area listed in  the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the permittee has substantially complied with the permit and  its associated recovery plan and requests an extension of the permit,  the Administrator will extend the permit with appropriate TCRs,  consistent with the Act, for so long thereafter as hard mineral  resources are recovered annually in commercial quantities from the area  to which the recovery plan associated with the permit applies.
