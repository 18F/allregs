                                Sec. 10.17  Is a beneficiary who defrauds the Government in   benefits?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When a beneficiary either pleads guilty to or is found guilty on  either Federal or State criminal charges of defrauding the Federal  Government in connection with a claim for benefits, the beneficiary's  entitlement to any further compensation benefits will terminate  effective the date of conviction, which is the date of the verdict or,  in the case of a plea bargain, the date the claimant made the plea in  open court (not the date of sentencing or the date court papers were  signed). The employing agency may, upon request, be required to provide  the documentation needed for termination under this section. Termination  of entitlement under this section is not affected by any subsequent  change in or recurrence of the beneficiary's medical condition.</p>
