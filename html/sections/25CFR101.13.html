                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> United States direct loans shall be secured by such security as  the Commissioner may require. A lack of security will not preclude the  making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the  information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that  expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan  principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that  the loan will be repaid. Loans made by relending organizations  conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds will require  borrowers to give security for loans, if available, but the absence of  security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of  the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting  papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all  expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating  reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. The declaration of  policy and plan of operation of relending organizations conducting  relending programs will include provisions covering the type and amount  of security to be taken to secure loans made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Land purchased by an individual Indian with the proceeds of a  loan and land already held in trust or restricted status by the  individual Indian may be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance  with 25 CFR 152.34 and the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; (25  U.S.C. 483a)). Mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land  will include only an acreage of the borrower's land which the  Commissioner determines is necessary to protect the loan in case of  default. On proposed foreclosures which involve the sale of individually  held trust or restricted land given as security for a loan, the tribe of  the reservation on which the land is located will be notified in writing  at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated date of  sale. Land purchased by a tribe with the proceeds of a loan from the  revolving loan fund with title taken in a trust or restricted status,  and land already held in a trust or restricted status by a tribe may not  be mortgaged as security for a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title to any land purchased by a tribe or by an individual  Indian with revolving loan funds may be taken in trust or restricted  status unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a  reservation or a tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary.  Title to any land purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is  outside the boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area  may be taken in trust if the purchaser was the owner of trust or  restricted interests in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title  shall be taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on  alienation, control, or use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mortgages of leasehold interests in land held in trust or  restricted status by an individual Indian, may be   taken for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development and  improvement of the leased premises when permitted in the lease or lease  modification agreement. Such mortgages must be approved by the lessor  and Commissioner. (70 Stat. 62, (25 U.S.C. 483a)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individuals may give assignments of income from trust property  as security for loans. Tribes may give assignments of trust income as  security for loans provided that the assignment shall be specific as to  the source(s) of income being assigned. All assignments of trust income  require approval by the Commissioner before becoming effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Chattels may be given as security for a loan. A mortgage on  chattels, the title to which is known to be in trust, requires  Commissioner approval. Non-trust chattels may be mortgaged without  approval of any federal official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Crops grown on lands held in trust or restricted status for the  benefit of an individual Indian may be given as security for a loan when  approved by the Commissioner. Crops grown on leased, trust or restricted  land may be given as security for a loan when permitted by the  provisions of a lease or when the owner gives written consent. Approval  of the lien document by the Commissioner is required. Crops grown on  trust or restricted land held by a tribe which has been assigned to an  individual for use may be given as security for a loan, provided the  terms of the assignment permit the assignee to give the crops as  security for a loan or the tribe's governing body specifically gives  consent. The lien document requires Commissioner approval. Crops grown  on non-trust or non-restricted land may be mortgaged without the  approval of any federal official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Title to any personal property purchased with a loan shall be  taken in the name of the purchaser and mortgaged to secure the loan  unless the loan is otherwise adequately secured. Tribes must adhere to  the provisions of their constitutions and bylaws, corporate charters, or  other organizational documents when mortgaging tribal property and  assigning trust income as security for loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Relending organizations receiving a loan from the United States  for relending shall be required to assign to the United States as  security for the loan all securities acquired in connection with loans  made to its members, sub-organizations, or associations from such funds,  unless the Commissioner determines that repayment of the loan to the  United States is otherwise reasonably assured. Funds advanced to finance  a tribal economic enterprise shall be secured by an assignment of net  income and net assets of the economic enterprise, unless the  Commissioner determines that it is not feasible to require an assignment  or that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise  reasonably assured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or  recorded in accordance with applicable state or federal laws except for  those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages  on documented vessels will be filed at the customs house designated as  the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.</p>
