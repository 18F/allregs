The respondent shall, within twenty (20) days after the service of a backpay specification accompanied by a notice of hearing, file an answer thereto in accordance with Sec. 1423.13 with the Regional Director issuing such specification. No answer need be filed by the respondent to a notice of hearing issued without a specification. After the issuance of a notice of hearing, with or without a backpay specification, the

procedures provided in Sec. Sec. 1423.14 to 1423.29, inclusive, shall be followed insofar as applicable.</p>
