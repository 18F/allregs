                                Sec. 90.677  Reconfiguration of the 806-824/851-869 MHz band in order
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In order to facilitate reconfiguration of the 806-824/851-869 MHz band (``800 MHz band'') to separate high-density cellular systems from non-cellular systems, Nextel Communications, Inc. (Nextel) may relocate incumbents within the 800 MHz band by providing ``comparable facilities.'' For the limited purpose of band reconfiguration, the provisions of Sec. 90.157 shall not apply and inter-category sharing will be permitted under all circumstances. Such relocation is subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within thirty days of Commission approval of the Transition Administrator, the Transition Administrator described in Sec. 90.676 will provide the Commission with a schedule detailing when band reconfiguration shall commence for each NPSPAC Region. The plan should also detail--by NPSPAC Region--which relocation option each non-Nextel ESMR licensees has chosen. The Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau will finalize and approve such a plan. The schedule shall provide for completion of band reconfiguration in no more than thirty-six months following release of a public notice announcing the start date of reconfiguration in the first NPSPAC region. Relocation will commence according to the schedule set by the Transition Administrator but all systems must have commenced reconfiguration within thirty months of release of a public notice announcing the start date of reconfiguration in the first NPSPAC region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary negotiations. Thirty days before the start date for each NPSPAC region other than Region 47 and Region 48, the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau will issue a public notice initiating a three-month voluntary negotiation period. During this voluntary negotiation period, Nextel and all incumbents may negotiate any mutually agreeable relocation agreement. Sprint Nextel and relocating incumbents may agree to conduct face-to-face negotiations or either party may elect to communicate

with the other party through the Transition Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mandatory negotiations. If no agreement is reached by the end of the voluntary period, a three-month mandatory negotiation period will begin during which both Sprint Nextel and the incumbents must negotiate in ``good faith.'' In Region 47, a 90-day mandatory negotiation period will begin 60 days after the effective date of the Third Report and Order and Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in WT Docket 02-55. In Region 48, a 90-day mandatory negotiation period will begin on March 21, 2011. Sprint Nextel and relocating incumbents may agree to conduct face-to-face negotiations or either party may elect to communicate with the other party through the Transition Administrator. All parties are charged with the obligation of utmost ``good faith'' in the negotiation process. Among the factors relevant to a ``good-faith'' determination are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the party responsible for paying the cost of band reconfiguration has made a bona fide offer to relocate the incumbent to comparable facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of relocation to comparable facilities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether either party has unreasonably withheld information, essential to the accurate estimation of relocation costs and procedures, requested by the other party. The Transition Administrator may schedule mandatory settlement negotiations and mediation sessions and the parties must conform to such schedules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transition Administrator. (1) The Transition Administrator, or other mediator, shall attempt to resolve disputes referred to it before the conclusion of the mandatory negotiation period as described in Sec. 90.677(c) within thirty working days after the Transition Administrator has received a submission by one party and a response from the other party. Any party thereafter may seek expedited non-binding arbitration which must be completed within thirty days of the Transition Administrator's, or other mediator's recommended decision or advice. Should issues still remain unresolved after mediation or arbitration they shall be referred to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau within ten days of the Transition Administrator's or other mediator's advice, or if arbitration has occurred, within ten days of the completion of arbitration. When referring an unresolved matter to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, the Transition Administrator shall forward the entire record on any disputed issues, including such dispositions thereof that the Transition Administrator has considered. Upon receipt of such record and advice, the Commission will decide the disputed issues based on the record submitted. The authority to make such decisions is delegated to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau who may decide the disputed issue or designate it for an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. If the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau decides an issue, any party to the dispute wishing to appeal the decision may do so by filing with the Commission, within ten days of the effective date of the initial decision, a Petition for de novo review; whereupon the matter will be set for an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. Any disputes submitted to the Transition Administrator after the conclusion of the mandatory negotiation period as described in Sec. 90.677(c) shall be resolved as described in Sec. 90.677(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Transition Administrator, or other mediator, shall attempt to resolve disputes referred to it before the conclusion of the mandatory negotiation period as described in Sec. 90.677(c) within thirty working days after the Transition Administrator has received a submission by one party and a response from the other party.

may do so by filing with the Commission, within ten days of the effective date of the initial decision, a Petition for de novo review; whereupon the matter will be set for an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver Requests. Incumbents who wish not to relocate according to the schedule may petition the Commission for a waiver of the relocation obligation. Such a waiver would only be granted on a strict non-interference basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Comparable Facilities. The replacement system provided to an incumbent must be at least equivalent to the existing 800 MHz system with respect to the four factors described in Sec. 90.699(d) part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Information Exchange. Absent agreement between parties, the Transition Administrator will be responsible for determining the information that relocating incumbents must supply in support of a relocation agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The relevant Regional Planning Committee shall be informed of any proposed changes to any NPSPAC channel.
