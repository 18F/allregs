                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The notification required by Sec. 577.5 shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be furnished no later than 60 days from the date the  manufacturer files its defect or noncompliance information report under  part 573. In the event that the remedy for the defect or noncompliance  is not available at the time of notification, the manufacturer shall  issue a second notification within a reasonable time and in accordance  with the requirements of this part once that remedy is available. The  Administrator may order a manufacturer to send the notification to  owners on a specific date where the Administrator finds, after  consideration of available information and the views of the  manufacturer, that such notification is in the public interest. The  factors that the Administrator may consider include, but are not limited  to, the severity of the safety risk; the likelihood of occurrence of the  defect or noncompliance; whether there is something that an owner can do  to reduce either the likelihood of occurrence of the defect or  noncompliance or the severity of the consequences; whether there will be  a delay in the availability of the remedy from the manufacturer; and the  anticipated length of any such delay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be accomplished--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a notification required to be sent by a motor  vehicle manufacturer, by first class mail to each person who is  registered under State law as the owner of the vehicle and whose name  and address are reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer through  State records or other sources available to him. If the owner cannot be  reasonably ascertained, the manufacturer shall notify the most recent  purchaser known to the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall also provide  notification to each lessee of a leased motor vehicle that is covered by  an agreement between the manufacturer and a lessor under which the  manufacturer is to notify lessees directly of safety-related defects and  noncompliances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a notification required to be sent by a  replacement equipment manufacturer--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> By first class mail to the most recent purchaser known to the  manufacturer, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> (Except in the case of a tire) if decided by the Administrator  to be required for motor vehicle safety, by public notice in such manner  as the Administrator may require after consultation with the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a manufacturer required to provide notification  concerning any defective or noncomplying tire, by first class or  certified mail.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a notification to be sent by a lessor to a  lessee of a leased motor vehicle, by first-class mail to the most recent  lessee known to the lessor. Such notification shall be mailed within ten  days of the lessor's receipt of the notification from the vehicle  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notification required by any paragraph of Sec. 577.6 shall  be provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 60 days after the manufacturer's receipt of the  Administrator's order to provide the notification, except that the  notification shall be furnished within a shorter or longer period if the  Administrator incorporates in his order a finding that such period is in  the public interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the manner and to the recipient specified in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The notification required by Sec. 577.13 shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be furnished within a reasonable time after the manufacturer  decides that a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety or a  noncompliance exists. In the case of defects or noncompliances that  present an immediate and substantial threat to motor vehicle safety, the  manufacturer shall transmit this notice to dealers and distributors  within three business days of its transmittal of the Defect and  Noncompliance Information Report under 49 CFR 573.6 to NHTSA, except  that when the manufacturer transmits the notice by other than electronic  means, the manufacturer shall transmit this   notice to dealers and distributors within five business days of its  transmittal of the Defect and Noncompliance Information Report to NHTSA.  In all other cases, the notification shall be provided in accordance  with the schedule submitted to the agency pursuant to Sec.  573.6(c)(8)(ii), unless that schedule is modified by the Administrator.  The Administrator may direct a manufacturer to send the notification to  dealers on a specific date if the Administrator finds, after  consideration of available information and the views of the  manufacturer, that such notification is in the public interest. The  factors that the Administrator may consider include, but are not limited  to, the severity of the safety risk; the likelihood of occurrence of the  defect or noncompliance; the time frame in which the defect or  noncompliance may manifest itself; availability of an interim remedial  action by the owner; whether a dealer inspection would identify vehicles  or items of equipment that contain the defect or noncompliance; and the  time frame in which the manufacturer plans to provide the notification  and the remedy to its dealers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be accomplished--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a notification required to be sent by a motor  vehicle manufacturer, by certified mail, verifiable electronic means  such as receipts or logs from electronic mail or satellite distribution  system, or other more expeditious and verifiable means to all dealers  and distributors of the vehicles that contain the defect or  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a notification required to be sent by a  manufacturer of replacement equipment or tires, by certified mail,  verifiable electronic means such as receipts or logs from electronic  mail or satellite distribution system, or other more expeditious and  verifiable means to all dealers and distributors of the product that are  known to the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In those cases where a manufacturer of motor vehicles or items  of motor vehicle equipment provided the recalled product(s) to a group  of dealers or distributors through a central office, notification to  that central office will be deemed to be notice to all dealers and  distributors within that group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In those cases in which a manufacturer of motor vehicles or  items of motor vehicle equipment has provided the recalled product to  independent dealers through independent distributors, the manufacturer  may satisfy its notification responsibilities by providing the  information required under this section to its distributors. In such  cases, the manufacturer must also instruct those distributors to  transmit a copy of the manufacturer's notification to known distributors  and retail outlets along the distribution chain within five working days  from its receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, where the  recall is being conducted pursuant to an order issued by the  Administrator under 49 U.S.C. 30118(b), notification required by Sec.  577.13 shall be given on or before the date prescribed in the  Administrator's order.
