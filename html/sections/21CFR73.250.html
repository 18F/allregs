(1) The color additive fruit juice is prepared either by expressing the juice from mature varieties of fresh, edible fruits, or by the water infusion of the dried fruit. The color additive may be concentrated or dried. The definition of fruit juice in this paragraph is for the purpose of identity as a color additive only and shall not be construed as a standard of identity under section 401 of the act. However, where a standard of identity for a particular fruit juice has been promulgated under section 401 of the act, it shall conform to such standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive fruit juice is prepared either by expressing the juice from mature varieties of fresh, edible fruits, or by the water infusion of the dried fruit.

The color additive and any mixtures intended solely or in part for coloring purposes prepared therefrom shall bear, in addition to the other information required by the act, labeling in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and therefore batches thereof are exempt from the certification requirements of section 721(c) of the act.
