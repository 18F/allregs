                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section is intended to meet the testing requirements  under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In the  assessment and evaluation of the toxic characteristics of a chemical,  the determination of subchronic oral toxicity may be carried out after  initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute testing. The  subchronic oral study has   been designed to permit the determination of the no-observed-effects  level (NOEL) and toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated  exposure to a test substance for a period of 90 days. This study is not  capable of determining those effects that have a long latency period for  development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life shortening). Extrapolation  from the results of this study to humans is valid only to a limited  degree. However, it can useful in providing information on health  hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure by the oral route over a  limited period of time, such as target organs, the possibilities of  accumulation, and can be of use in selecting dose levels for chronic  studies and for establishing safety criteria for human exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test  guideline is the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances  (OPPTS) harmonized test guideline 870.3100 (August 1998, final  guideline). This source is available at the address in paragraph (h) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses  occurring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration  of, the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible  tissue.</p><p class="depth0">Dose in a subchronic oral study is the amount of test substance  administered daily via the oral route (gavage, drinking water or diet)  for a period of 90 days. Dose is expressed as weight of the test  substance (grams, milligrams) per unit body weight of test animal  (milligram per kilogram) or as weight of the test substance in parts per  million in food or drinking water per day.</p><p class="depth0">No-observed-effects level (NOEL) is the maximum dose used in a study  which produces no adverse effects. The NOEL is usually expressed in  terms of the weight of a test substance given daily per unit weight of  test animal (milligrams per kilogram per day).</p><p class="depth0">Subchronic oral toxicity is the adverse effects occurring as a  result of the repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a  chemical by the oral route for a part (approximately 10%) of the test  animal's life span.</p><p class="depth0">Target organ is any organ of a test animal showing evidence of an  effect induced by a test substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1,000 mg/kg  body weight (expected human exposure may indicate the need for a higher  dose level), using the procedures described for this study, produces no  observable toxic effects or if toxic effects would not be expected based  upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using  three dose levels might not be necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain. A  variety of rodent species may be used, although the rat is the preferred  species. Commonly used laboratory strains must be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age/weight. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Testing should be started with young healthy  animals as soon as possible after weaning and acclimatization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dosing of rodents should generally begin no later than 8-9 weeks  of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> At the commencement of the study the weight variation of animals  used must be within 20% of the mean weight for each sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sex. Equal numbers of animals of each sex must be used at each  dose level, and the females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Numbers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least 20 rodents (10 males and 10 females) at  each dose level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If interim sacrifices are planned, the number must be increased  by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before the  completion of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To avoid bias, the use of adequate randomization procedures for  the proper allocation of animals to test and control groups is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Each animal must be assigned a unique identification number.  Dead animals, their preserved organs and tissues, and microscopic slides  must be identified by reference to the animal's unique number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Husbandry. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Animals may be group-caged by sex, but the number  of animals per cage must not interfere with clear observation of each  animal.   The biological properties of the test substance or toxic effects (e.g.,  morbidity, excitability) may indicate a need for individual caging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The temperature of the experimental animal rooms should be at 22  3 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The relative humidity of the experimental animal rooms should be  50 20%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where lighting is artificial, the sequence should be 12 hours  light/12 hours dark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Control and test animals must be fed from the same batch and  lot. The feed should be analyzed to assure adequacy of nutritional  requirements of the species tested and for impurities that might  influence the outcome of the test. For feeding, conventional laboratory  diets may be used with an unlimited supply of drinking water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The study should not be initiated until animals have been  allowed a period of acclimatization/quarantine to environmental  conditions, nor should animals from outside sources be placed on test  without an adequate period of quarantine. An acclimation period of at  least five days is recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control and test substances. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where necessary, the test  substance is dissolved or suspended in a suitable vehicle. If a vehicle  or diluent is needed, the vehicle should not elicit toxic effects or  substantially alter the chemical or toxicological properties of the test  substance. It is recommended that wherever possible the usage of an  aqueous solution be considered first, followed by consideration of a  solution in oil and then solution in other vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If possible, one lot of the test substance tested should be  used throughout the duration of the study and the research sample should  be stored under conditions that maintain its purity and stability. Prior  to the initiation of the study, there should be a characterization of  the test substance, including the purity of the test compound and, if  technically feasible, the names and quantities of contaminants and  impurities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the test or control substance is to be incorporated into  feed or another vehicle, the period during which the test substance is  stable in such a mixture should be determined prior to the initiation of  the study. Its homogeneity and concentration should be determined prior  to the initiation of the study and periodically during the study.  Statistically randomized samples of the mixture should be analyzed to  ensure that proper mixing, formulation, and storage procedures are being  followed, and that the appropriate concentration of the test or control  substance is contained in the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This  group must be an untreated or sham-treated control group or, if a  vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control  group. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be  made available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Satellite group. A satellite group of 20 animals (10 animals per  sex) may be treated with the high dose level for 90 days and observed  for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic effects  for a post-treatment period of appropriate length, normally not less  than 28 days. In addition, a control group of 20 animals (10 animals of  each sex) should be added to the satellite study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dose levels and dose selection. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In subchronic toxicity  tests, it is desirable to determine a dose-response relationship as well  as a NOEL. Therefore, at least three dose levels plus a control and,  where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration  of vehicle at the highest dose level) must be used. Doses should be  spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic  effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The highest dose level should result in toxic effects but not  produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful  evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The intermediate dose levels should be spaced to produce a  gradation of toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The lowest dose level should produce no evidence of toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Administration of the test substance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the test substance  is administered by gavage, the animals are dosed with the test substance  on a 7-day per week basis for a period of at least 90 days.   However, based primarily on practical considerations, dosing by gavage  on a 5-day per week basis is acceptable. If the test substance is  administered in the drinking water, or mixed in the diet, then exposure  should be on a 7-day per week basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All animals must be dosed by the same method during the entire  experimental period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For substances of low toxicity, it is important to ensure that  when administered in the diet the quantities of the test substance  involved do not interfere with normal nutrition. When the test substance  is administered in the diet, either a constant dietary concentration  (parts per million) or a constant dose level in terms of body weight  should be used; the alternative used should be specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For a substance administered by gavage, the dose should be  given at approximately the same time each day, and adjusted at intervals  (weekly or biweekly) to maintain a constant dose level in terms of body  weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Observation period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The animals must be observed for a  period of 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Animals in the satellite group (if used) scheduled for follow- up observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without  treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Observation of animals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observations must be made at least  twice each day for morbidity and mortality. Appropriate actions should  be taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy or  refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of  weak or moribund animals). General clinical observations should be made  at least once a day, preferably at the same time each day, taking into  consideration the peak period of anticipated effects after dosing. The  clinical condition of the animal should be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A careful clinical examination must be made at least once  weekly. Observations should be detailed and carefully recorded,  preferably using explicity defined scales. Observations should include,  but not be limited to, evaluation of skin and fur, eyes and mucous  membranes, respiratory and circulatory effects, autonomic effects such  as salivation, central nervous system effects, including tremors and  convulsions, changes in the level of activity, gait and posture,  reactivity to handling or sensory stimuli, altered strength, and  stereotypes or bizarre behavior (e.g., self-mutilation, walking  backwards).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Signs of toxicity should be recorded as they are observed  including the time of onset, degree and duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Measurements of food consumption and water consumption, if  drinking water is the exposure route, must be made weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Individual weights of animals must be determined shortly before  the test substance is administered, weekly thereafter, and at death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Moribund animals should be removed and sacrificed when noticed  and the time of death should be recorded as precisely as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> At termination, all survivors in the treatment and control  groups must be sacrificed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Clinical pathology. Hematology and clinical chemistry  examinations must be made on all animals, including controls, of each  sex in each group. The hematology and clinical chemistry parameters  should be examined at terminal sacrifice at the end of the study.  Overnight fasting of the animals prior to blood sampling is recommended.  Overall, there is a need for a flexible approach in the measures  examined, depending on the observed or expected effects from a chemical,  and in the frequency of measures, depending on the duration of potential  chemical exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hematology. The recommended parameters are red blood cell count,  hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean  corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration,  white blood cell count, differential leukocyte count, platelet count,  and a measure of clotting potential, such as prothrombin time or  activated partial thromboplastin time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clinical chemistry. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Parameters which are considered  appropriate to all studies are electrolyte balance, carbohydrate  metabolism, and liver and kidney function. The selection of specific   tests will be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the  substance and signs of clinical toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The recommended clinical chemistry determinations are potassium,  sodium, glucose, total cholesterol, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total  protein and albumin. More than 2 hepatic enzymes, (such as alanine  aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,  sorbitol dehydrogenase, or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase) should also be  measured. Measurements of addtional enzymes (of hepatic or other origin)  and bile acids, may also be useful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a test chemical has an effect on the hematopoietic system,  reticulocyte counts and bone marrow cytology may be indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other determinations that should be carried out if the test  chemical is known or suspected of affecting related measures include  calcium, phosphorus, fasting triglycerides, hormones, methemoglobin, and  cholinesterases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Optionally, the following urinalysis determinations could be  performed during the last week of the study using timed urine volume  collection: appearance, volume, osmolality or specific gravity, pH,  protein, glucose and blood/blood cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Ophthalmological examination. Ophthalmological examinations  using an ophthalmoscope or an equivalent device must be made on all  animals prior to the administration of the test substance and on all  high dose and control groups at termination. If changes in the eyes are  detected, all animals in the other dose groups must be examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Gross necropsy. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All animals must be subjected to a full  gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the  body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic and abdominal cavities and  their contents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The liver, kidneys, adrenals, testes, epididymides, ovaries,  uterus, thymus, spleen, brain, and heart must be trimmed and weighed  wet, as soon as possible after dissection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following organs and tissues, or representative samples  thereof, should be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future  histopathological examination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Digestive system--salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, duodenum,  jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, gallbladder (when  present).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nervous system--brain (including sections of medulla/pons,  cerebellum and cerebrum), pituitary, peripheral nerve (sciatic or  tibial, preferably in close proximity to the muscle), spinal cord (three  levels: cervical, mid-thoracic and lumbar), eyes (retina, optic nerve).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Glandular system--adrenals, parathyroid, thyroid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Respiratory system--trachea, lungs, pharynx, larynx, nose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Cardiovascular/hemopoietic system--aorta, heart, bone marrow  (and/or fresh aspirate), lymph nodes (preferably one lymph node covering  the route of administration and another one distant from the route of  administration to cover systemic effects), spleen, thymus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Urogenital system--kidneys, urinary bladder, prostate, testes,  epididymides, seminal vesicle(s), uterus, ovaries, female mammary gland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Others--all gross lesions and masses, skin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Histopathology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following histopathology must be  performed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Full histopathology on the organs and tissues, listed in  paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, of all rodents in the control  and high dose groups, and all rodents that died or were sacrificed  during the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All gross lesions in all animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Target tissues in all animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When a satellite group is used, histopathology should be  performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the  treated groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If excessive early deaths or other problems occur in the high  dose group compromising the significance of the data, the next dose  level should be examined for complete histopathology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An attempt should be made to correlate gross observations with  microscopic findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tissues and organs designated for microscopic examination  should be fixed in 10% buffered formalin or a recognized suitable  fixative as soon as necropsy is performed and no less than 48 hours  prior to trimming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data must be  summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of  animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions,  the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type  of lesion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When applicable, all observed results, qualitative and  quantitative, should be evaluated by an appropriate and generally  accepted statistical method. Any generally accepted statistical methods  may be used; the statistical methods, including significance criteria,  should be selected during the design of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation of study results. The findings of a subchronic oral  toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of  preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects and the  necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation must include the  relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or  absence, the incidence and severity, of abnormalities, including  behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target  organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general  or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted subchronic test should  provide a satisfactory estimation of a NOEL. It also can indicate the  need for an additional longer-term study and provide information on the  selection of dose levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test report. In addition to reporting requirements specified  under EPA Good Laboratory Practice Standards at 40 CFR part 792, subpart  J, the following specific information must be reported:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test substance characterization should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Chemical identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Lot or batch number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Physical properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Purity/impurities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification and composition of any vehicle used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Test system should contain data on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Species and strain of animals used and rationale for selection  if other than that recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Age including body weight data and sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Test environment including cage conditions, ambient temperature,  humidity, and light/dark periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Identification of animal diet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Acclimation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test procedure should include the following data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Method of randomization used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Full description of experimental design and procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Dose regimen including levels, methods, and volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Test results should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Group animal data.
