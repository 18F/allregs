They shall be free from sharp or protruding objects which may,  in the opinion of the inspector, cause injury or pain to the animals.

Slip resistant or waffled floor surfaces, cleated ramps and the use of  sand, as appropriate, during winter months are examples of acceptable  construction and maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. Suspects (as defined in Sec. 301.2(xxx)) and dying,  diseased, and disabled livestock (as defined in Sec. 301.2(y)) shall be  provided with a covered pen sufficient, in the opinion of the inspector,  to protect them from the adverse climatic conditions of the locale while  awaiting disposition by the inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Livestock pens and driveways shall be so arranged that sharp  corners and direction reversal of driven animals are minimized.
