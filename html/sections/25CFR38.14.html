                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. An ASE or AEPA may, subject to the approval of the local  school board concerned, accept voluntary services on behalf of Bureau  schools from the private sector, including individuals, groups, or  students. Voluntary service shall be for all non-hazardous activities  where public services, special projects, or school operations are  improved and enhanced. Volunteer service is limited to personal services  received without compensation (salary or wages) by the Bureau from  individuals, groups, and students. Nothing in this section shall be  construed to require Federal employees to work without compensation or  to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace Federal  employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Volunteer service agreement. An agreement is a written document,  jointly completed by the volunteer, the Bureau school supervisor, and  the school board, that outlines the responsibilities of each. In the  case of students receiving credit for their work (i.e., student  teaching) from an education institution, the agreement will be jointly  completed by the student, a representative of the institution, and the  Bureau school supervisor. In the case of volunteer groups, the agreement  shall be signed by an official of the volunteering organization, the  Bureau school supervisor, and the school board and a list of signatures  and emergency telephone numbers of all participants shall be attached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility. Although no minimum age requirement exists for  volunteers, schools shall comply with appropriate Federal and State laws  and standards on using the services of minors. All   volunteers under the age of 18 must obtain written permission from their  parents or guardians to perform volunteer activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Status. Volunteers participating under this part are not  considered Federal employees for any purpose other than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, dealing with compensation for  injuries sustained during the performance of work assignments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal tort claims provisions published in 28 U.S.C. chapter  171.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Department of the Interior Regulations Governing  Responsibilities and Conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Travel and other expenses. The decision to reimburse travel and  other incidental expenses, as well as the amount of reimbursement, shall  be made by the school supervisor, ASE, AEPA, and the respective school  board. Payment is made in the same manner as for regular employees.  Payment of travel and per diem expenses to a volunteer on a particular  assignment must be supported by a specific travel authorization and  cannot exceed the cost of employing a temporary employee of comparable  qualification at the school for which a travel authorization is  considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Annual report. School supervisors shall submit reports on  volunteers to the ASE or AEPA by October 31 of each year for the  preceding year.</p>
