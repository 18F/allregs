                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Supplies for vessels or aircraft--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An article  subject to tax under Chapter 32 may be sold tax free by the  manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(3) and this section, for use  by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft. See paragraph (b)  of this section for the meaning of the term ``supplies for vessels or  aircraft.'' An article may be sold tax free under the provisions of this  section only in those cases where the sale of an article by the  manufacturer is made directly to the owner, officer, charterer, or  authorized agent of a vessel or aircraft for use as supplies for the  vessel or aircraft. No sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale  for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, even though it is known at  the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold.  See section 6416(b)(2)(B) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 48.6416 (b)-2  for circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where  tax-paid articles are used, or sold for use, as supplies for vessels or  aircraft. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of  this section by the manufacturer to passengers or members of the crew of  a vessel or aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Civil aircraft of foreign registry. In the case of any article  sold by the manufacturer for use by the purchaser as supplies for civil  aircraft of foreign registry employed in foreign trade or in trade  between the United States and any of its possessions, the provisions of  this paragraph apply only if the reciprocity requirements of section  4221(e)(1) are met. See paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Meaning of terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Supplies for vessels or aircraft. The term  ``supplies for vessels or aircraft'' means fuel supplies, ships' stores,  sea stores, or legitimate equipment on vessels of war of the United  States or of any foreign nation, vessels employed in the fisheries or in  the whaling business, or vessels actually engaged in foreign trade or  trade between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States or  between the United States and any of its possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuel supplies, ships' stores, and legitimate equipment. The  terms ``fuel supplies'', ``ships' stores'', and ``legitimate equipment''  include all articles, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary for  the navigation, propulsion, and upkeep of vessels of war of the United  States or of any foreign nation, vessels employed in the fisheries or in  the whaling business, or vessels actually engaged in foreign trade or in  trade between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States or  between the United States and any of its possessions, even though such  vessels may make intermediate stops in the United States. The term does  not include supplies for vessels engaged in trade (i) between domestic  ports in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, (ii) between  domestic ports on the Pacific Ocean, (iii) between domestic ports on the  Great Lakes, or (iv) on the inland waterways of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sea stores. The term ``sea stores'' includes any article  purchased for use or consumption by the passengers or crew, or both, of  a vessel during its voyage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Vessels. The term ``vessel'' includes (i) every description of  watercraft or other contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a  means of transportation on water, (ii) civil aircraft registered in the  United States and employed in foreign trade or in trade between the  United States and any of its possessions, and (iii) civil aircraft  registered in a foreign country and employed in foreign trade or in  trade between the United States and any of its possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessels of war of the United States or of any foreign nation.  The term ``vessels of war of the United States or of any foreign  nation'' includes (i) every description of watercraft or other  contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation  on water and constituting equipment of the armed forces (including the  U.S. Coast   Guard and U.S. National Guard) of the United States or of a foreign  nation, and (ii) aircraft owned by the United States or by any foreign  nation and constituting equipment of the armed forces thereof. For  purposes of this section, vessels or aircraft owned by armed forces are  not considered to be equipment of such armed forces while on lease or  loan to an organization that is not part of the armed forces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Vessels used in fisheries or whaling business. The exemption  provided by section 4221(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section in the  case of articles sold for the prescribed use on vessels employed in the  fisheries or whaling business is limited to articles sold by the  manufacturer for such use on vessles while employed, and to the extent  employed, exclusively in the fisheries or in the whaling business. For  purposes of this section, vessels engaged in sport fishing are not  considered to be employed in the fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Civil aircraft. The exemption provided by section 4221(a)(3) and  paragraph (a) of this section relating to supplies for vessels or  aircraft, with respect to civil aircraft, extends only to civil aircraft  when employed in foreign trade, or in trade between the United States  and any of its possessions. Sales of supplies to civil aircraft when  engaged in trade between the Atlantic and the Pacific ports of the  United States are not exempt from the tax imposed under Chapter 32. See  section 4221(e)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section for requirement of  reciprocal exemption in the case of a civil aircraft registered in a  foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Trade. The term ``trade'' includes the transportation of persons  or property for hire and the making of the necessary preparations for  such transportation. The term ``trade'' also includes the transportation  of property on a vessel or aircraft owned or chartered by the owner of  the property in connection with the purchase, sale, or exchange of the  property in a commercial business operation. However, a vessel owned or  chartered by a company and used in the transportation of personnel or  property of such company to or from its business properties located in a  foreign country, or in a possession of the United States, is not engaged  in ``trade''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reciprocity required in the case of civil aircraft. The  exemption provided by section 4221(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this  section with respect to the sales of supplies for civil aircraft  registered in a foreign country is further limited in that the privilege  of exemption may be granted only if the Secretary of Commerce advises  the Secretary of the Treasury that the foreign country allows, or will  allow, substantially the same reciprocal privileges. If a foreign  country discontinues the allowance of such substantially reciprocal  exemption, the exemption allowed by the United States will not apply  after the Secretary of the Treasury is notified by the Secretary of  Commerce of the discontinuance of the exemption allowed by the foreign  country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Evidence required to establish exemption--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  exemption provided in section 4221(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this  section for articles sold for use by the purchaser as supplies for  vessels or aircraft applies only (i) if both the manufacturer and  purchaser are registered under the provisions of section 4222 or (ii)  the purchaser or both the manufacturer and the purchaser are not  registered but have satisfied the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this  section. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 48.4221-1 for the evidence required  to establish exemption where the purchaser is registered pursuant to  section 4222 and Sec. 48.4222(a)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemption certificates for use in support of tax-free sales of  supplies for vessels and aircraft. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order to establish exemption  from tax under section 4221(a)(3) in those instances where the purchaser  or both the manufacturer and purchaser are not registered under section  4222, the manufacturer must obtain (prior to or at the time of the sale)  from the owner, charterer, or authorized agent of the vessel or aircraft  and retain in the manufacturer's possession a properly executed  exemption certificate in the form prescribed by subdivision (iii) of  this paragraph (d)(2). If articles are sold tax free for use as supplies  for civil aircraft employed in foreign trade or in trade between the  United States and any of its possessions, the exemption certificate   must show the name of the country in which the aircraft is registered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where only occasional sales of articles are made to a purchaser  for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, a separate exemption  certificate shall be furnished for each order. However, where sales are  regularly or frequently made to a purchaser for such exempt use, a  certificate covering all orders for a specified period not to exceed 12  calendar quarters will be acceptable. Such certificates and proper  records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be  kept for inspection by the district director as provided in section 6001  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Acceptable form of exemption certificate. The following form  of exemption certificate will be acceptable for the purposes of this  section and must by adhered to in substance:</p><p class="depth0">Exemption Certificate  (For use by purchasers of articles for use as fuel supplies, ships  stores, sea stores, of legitimate equipment on certain vessels or  aircraft (sections 4221 and 4222 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Date)</em> --------------------------, 19----.</p><p class="depth0">I, the undersigned purchaser, hereby certify that I am the -------- -------- (Owner, charterer, or authorized agent) of ---------- (Name of  company and vessel) and that: (Check applicable type of certificate) ---- the article or articles specified in the accompanying order, or on  the reverse side hereof, (or) ---- all orders placed by the purchaser for the period commencing (Date)  ------ and ending (Date) ------ (period not to exceed 12 calendar  quarters), will be used only for fuel supplies, ships' stores, sea  stores, or legitimate equipment on a vessel belonging to one of the  following classes of vessels to which section 4221 of the Internal  Revenue Code applies: (Check class to which vessel belongs.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels engaged in foreign</p><p class="depth0">trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vessels engaged in trade</p><p class="depth0">between the Atlantic and Pacific</p><p class="depth0">ports of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Vessels engaged in trade</p><p class="depth0">between the United States and any</p><p class="depth0">of its possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Vessels employed in the</p><p class="depth0">fisheries or whaling business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessels of war of the United</p><p class="depth0">States or a foreign nation.</p><p class="depth0">If the articles are purchased for use on civil aircraft engaged in  trade as specified in (1) or (3) above, state the name of the country in  which the aircraft is registered:  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">I understand that if the articles are used for any purpose other  than as stated in this certificate, or are resold or otherwise disposed  of, I must report such fact to the manufacturer.

I also understand that I must be prepared to establish by satisfactory  evidence the purpose for which the article was used.  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Signature)</em> ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Address)</em></p>
