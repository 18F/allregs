                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing. All papers to be filed with the ALJ shall be addressed  to ``Additional Protocol Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,'' at  the address set forth in the NOVA, or such other place as the ALJ may  designate. Filing by United States certified mail, by express or  equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery  is acceptable. Filing from a foreign country shall be by airmail, via  facsimile, or by express or equivalent parcel delivery service. A copy  of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service. Service shall be made by United States certified mail,  by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by  hand delivery of one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding.  Service on the government party in all proceedings shall be addressed to  Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, U.S. Department of  Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-3839,  Washington, DC 20230, or sent via facsimile to (202) 482-0085. Service  on a respondent shall be to the address to which the NOVA was sent, or  to such other address as the respondent may provide. When a party has  appeared by counsel or other representative, service on counsel or other  representative shall constitute service on that party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date. The date of filing or service is the day when the papers  are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery  service, or by facsimile. Refusal by the person to be served, or by the  person's agent or attorney, of service of a document or other paper will  be considered effective service of the document or other paper as of the  date of such refusal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certificate of service. A certificate of service signed by the  party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall  accompany every paper, other than the NOVA, filed and served on the  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed  or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from  which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included.  The last day of the period is to be included in the computation unless  it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). In such instance, the period  runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday,  nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays  are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or  allowed is 7 days or less--there is no cap on the period of time to  which this exclusion applies, whenever the period of time prescribed or  allowed by this part is computed in business days, rather than calendar  days.</p>
