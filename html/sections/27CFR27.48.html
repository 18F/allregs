Sec. 27.48a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 26 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 26 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 26 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States and importations (including products of the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words ``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An importer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Customs Service.
