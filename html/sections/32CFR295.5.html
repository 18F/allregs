                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is the policy of the OIG to promote public trust  by conducting its activities in an open manner, and by providing the  public with the maximum amount of accurate and timely information  concerning those activities, consistent with the need for security and  adherence to other requirements of law and regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records not specifically exempt from disclosure under the FOIA  or prohibited by statutory or other regulatory requirements will, upon  request, be made readily accessible to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records that are specifically exempt from disclosure under the  FOIA or prohibited by statutory or other regulatory requirements will be  withheld from the public only upon the determination of the initial  Denial Authorities identified in Sec. 295.6 of this part, or the  designated Appellate Authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> News Media Requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests from news media  representatives for records that would not be withheld if requested  under the FOIA or prohibited from release under other statutory or  regulatory authority, will be released promptly by the OIG element  originating the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests from news media representatives for records that are  exempt from release under the FOIA, or prohibited from release under  other statutory or regulatory authority will be provided to the Freedom  of Information Act and Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) Division, Office of the  Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, along with the requested  records, for review and a release determination and the news media  representatives will be so advised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extracts of the nonexempt portions of such records may be  prepared in response to a specific request from a news media  representative but shall be coordinated for release with the FOIA/PA  Division. Extracts shall be prepared in accordance with the sample at  appendix to Sec. 295.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Control System. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for OIG records that invokes the  FOIA shall enter a formal control system designed to ensure compliance  with the FOIA. A release determination must be made and the requester  informed within the time limits specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any request for OIG records that either explicitly or implicitly  cites the FOIA will be processed under the provisions set forth in this  part, unless otherwise required by Sec. 295.5(m) of this part. All such  requests shall be forwarded to the FOIA/PA Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Promptness of Response. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request from a member of the  public for OIG records will be responded to within 10 working days of  the date of its receipt in the FOIA/PA Division, unless a delay is  authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receipt of the request will be acknowledged and the requester  will be promptly advised of any additional information needed to assure  compliance with procedures established in this part. In the event there  are a significant number of requests, e.g., 10 or more, the requests  will be processed in order of date of receipt. This does not   preclude the OIG from completing action on a request which can be easily  answered, regardless of its ranking within the order of receipt. The OIG  may expedite action on a request regardless of its ranking within the  order of receipt upon a showing of exceptional need or urgency.  Exceptional need will be determined at the discretion of the OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> These provisions also apply to a request received on referral  from another DoD Component or government agency and time limits will  begin on the date of receipt in the OIG FOIA/PA Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of Exemptions. It is OIG policy to make records publicly  available unless they qualify for exemption under one or more of the  nine exemptions. The OIG may elect to make a discretionary release,  however, a discretionary release is generally not appropriate for  records exempt under exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6) and  (b)(7)(C). Exemptions (b)(4), (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) can not be claimed  when the requester is the submitter of the information. The categories  of records which are exempt from release are identified in appendix B of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For Official Use Only (FOUO). The use of FOUO markings will be  accomplished in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this  part, and exemptions (b)(2) through (b)(9) as set forth in appendix B of  this part. Additional guidance will be provided to OIG elements, as  needed, by the FOIA/PA Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Public Domain. Nonexempt records released under the authority of  this part are considered to be in the public domain. Such records may  also be made available in the OIG Reading Room located in the FOIA/PA  Division. Exempt records released pursuant to this part or other  statutory or regulatory authority, however, may be considered to be in  the public domain only when their release constitutes a waiver of the  FOIA exemption. When the release does not constitute such a waiver, such  as when disclosure is made to a properly constituted advisory committee  or to a Congressional Committee, or to an individual to whom the record  pertains, the released records do not lose their exempt status. Also,  while authority may exist to disclose records to individuals in their  official capacity, the provisions of this part apply if the same  individual seeks to use the records in a private or personal capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Creation of Records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record must exist and be in the  possession or control of the OIG at the time of the request to be  considered subject to release under this part and the FOIA. Mere  possession of a record does not presume OIG control and such records, or  identifiable portions thereof, will be referred to the originating  agency for a release determination and/or direct response to the  requester. There is no obligation to create nor compile a record to  satisfy a FOIA request; however, the OIG may compile a new record when  doing so would result in a more useful response to the requester, or be  less burdensome to the OIG than providing the existing records, and the  requester does not object. The cost of creating or compiling such a  record will not be charged to the requester unless the fee is equal to,  or less than, the fee that would be charged for providing the existing  record. Any fee assessments will be made in accordance with chapter IV  of DoD 5400.7-R (32 CFR part 286).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to electronic data, the issue of whether records  are actually created or merely extracted from an existing database is  not always readily apparent. Consequently, when responding to FOIA  requests for electronic data where creation of a record, programming, or  particular format are questionable, the OIG will apply a standard of  reasonableness. In other words, if the capability exists to respond to  the request, and the effort would be a business as usual approach, then  the request will be processed. However, the request will not be  processed where the capability to respond does not exist without a  significant expenditure of resources, thus not be a normal business as  usual approach.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Describing Records Sought. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is the responsibility of the  member of the public requesting records to adequately identify the  records. A member of the public must describe the records sought with  sufficient information to permit the OIG to locate the records with a  reasonable amount of effort,   since the FOIA does not authorize ``fishing expeditions.'' Descriptive  information about a record may be divided into two broad categories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Category I is file-related and includes information such as type  of record (for example, memorandum), title, index citation, subject  area, date the record was created, and originator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Category II is event-related and includes the circumstances  that resulted in the record being created or the date and circumstances  surrounding the event the record covers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the OIG receives a request that does not ``reasonably  describe'' the requested record with sufficient Category I information  to permit the conduct of an organized nonrandom search, or sufficient  Category II information to permit inference of the Category I elements  needed to conduct such a search, the requester will be notified in  writing of the defect and of the need for more specific identification  of the records sought. The specificity letter will provide guidance in  identifying the records sought and in reformulating the request to  reduce the burden on the OIG in complying with the FOIA. The OIG is not  obligated to act on requests until an adequate description is provided  by the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the OIG receives a request in which only personal  identifiers, e.g., name and Social Security Account Number, are provided  in connection with the request for records concerning the requester,  only records retrievable by personal identifiers will be searched. The  search for such records may be conducted under Privacy Act procedures.  No record will be denied that is releasable under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Referrals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OIG has the responsibility of protecting the  identity of individuals who make protected disclosures of wrongdoing on  the part of others, under the ``Whistleblower Protection Acts''. When a  FOIA requester has identified himself/herself as the ``Whistleblower''  in the matter for which records are being sought, in accordance with  Sec. 295.7(b)(3) of this part, or the FOIA/PA Division can reasonably  determine that the FOIA requester is the ``Whistleblower'', the  individual's identity will continue to be protected in all of the  following circumstances involving referrals, except to the extent that  such protection will impede the release of responsive records to the  requester. In such event, the requester will be advised of the impedance  and offered the option of allowing himself/herself to be identified  solely for the purpose of obtaining maximum release of records  responsive to the FOIA request. If the requester chooses to continue  anonymity, the request will be processed only to the extent that will  allow continued protection of the individual's identity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OIG will refer a FOIA request to another DoD Component or to  a Government agency outside the DoD when the OIG has no records  responsive to the request, but believes the other DoD Component or  outside agency may have, and the other DoD Component or outside agency  has confirmed that it holds the record. When the other DoD Component or  outside agency agrees to the referral, the requester will be advised of  the referral and that the OIG has no responsive records, with the  following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If it is determined by the other DoD Component or outside agency  that the existence or nonexistence of the record itself is classified,  the OIG will inform the requester only that the OIG has no responsive  record and no referral will take place.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the record falls under one or more of the ``Exclusions''  under the FOIA (see appendix B of this part), as determined by the other  DoD Component or outside agency, the OIG will advise the requester only  that the OIG has no responsive record and no referral will take place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The OIG will refer a record, or portions of a record that holds  but that was originated by another DoD Component or outside agency, or  for a record that contains substantial information that originated with  another DoD Component or outside agency, to that Component or agency  (unless the agency is not subject to the FOIA) for a release  determination and/or direct response to the requester. In any such case,  direct coordination will be effected and concurrence obtained from the  other Component or agency prior to the referral. A copy of the record  will be provided to   the Component or agency with the referral, and the requester will be  notified of the referral, consistent with any security requirements or  ``Exclusion'' provisions of the FOIA. The OIG will not, in any case,  release or deny such records without prior consultation with the other  DoD Component or outside agency. If the requester is the  ``Whistleblower'', the record or portion of the record will be provided  to the DoD Component or agency, with a request for a release  determination and return of the record to the OIG for response to the  requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The OIG will refer a FOIA request for a classified record that  it holds, but did not originate, to the originating DoD Component or  outside agency (unless the agency is not subject to the FOIA). If the  record originated with the OIG but the classification is derivative,  i.e., contains classified information that originated elsewhere and was  incorporated in the OIG record, the record will be referred to the  originating authority with a recommendation for release; or, after  consultation with the originating authority, with a request for a  declassification review and/or release determination and return of the  record. If the requester is the ``Whistleblower'', the record will be  provided to the originating authority with a request for a release  determination and return of the record to the OIG for response to the  requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The OIG may also refer a request for a record that was  originated by the OIG for the use of another DoD Component or outside  agency, to that Component or agency with a recommendation for release,  after any necessary coordination. The requester will be notified of such  action consistent with any security requirements or ``Exclusion''  provisions of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A FOIA request for investigative, intelligence, or any other  type of record on loan from another DoD Component or outside agency to  the OIG for a specific purpose will be referred to the DoD Component or  outside agency that provided the records, if the records are restricted  from further release and so marked. However, if for investigative or  intelligence purposes, the outside Component or agency desires anonymity  as determined through coordination, the OIG will respond directly to the  requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A FOIA request for a record, or portions of a record, held by  the OIG, that originated with a non-U.S. government agency that is not  subject to the FOIA, will be responded to by the OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, all  requesters seeking National Security Council (NSC) or White House  documents will be advised that they should write directly to the NSC or  White House for such documents. Should the requester insist upon an OIG  search for these records, the OIG will conduct an appropriate search  pursuant to the FOIA. OIG/DoD documents in which the NSC or White House  has a concurrent reviewing interest will be forwarded by the FOIA/PA  Division to the Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review  (DFOISR), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs)  (OASD(PA)), which shall effect coordination with the NSC or White House,  and return the documents to the originating agency after NSC review and  determination. The FOIA/PA Division will forward any documents found in  OIG files that are responsive to the FOIA request to DFOISR, OASD(PA)  for their coordination with the NSC or White House, and return to the  OIG with a release determination for final processing of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> On occasion, the OIG receives FOIA requests for General  Accounting Office (GAO) documents containing OIG information. Even  though the GAO is outside of the Executive Branch, and not subject to  the FOIA, all FOIA requests for GAO documents containing DoD information  received directly from the public, or on referral from the GAO, will be  processed under the provisions of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Authentication of Records. Records provided under this part will  be authenticated, upon written request, to fulfill an official  Government or other legal function. This service is in addition to that  required under the FOIA and is not included in the FOIA fee schedule;  therefore, a fee of $5.20 may be charged for each such authentication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Records Management. FOIA records shall be maintained and  disposed of in   accordance with Inspector General Defense Manual (IGDM) 5015.2, \1\  ``Records Management Program''. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the Information and  Operations Support Directorate, Publications Management Branch, room  420, 400 Army Navy Drive, Arlington, VA 22202-2884. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Relationship Between the FOIA and the Privacy Act (PA). Not all  requesters are knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to  cite when requesting records. In some instances, they may cite neither  Act, but will imply one or both Acts. For these reasons, the following  guidelines are provided to ensure that requesters receive the greatest  amount of access rights under both Acts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where requesters seek records about themselves which are  contained in a PA system of records and cite or imply the PA, the OIG  will process their requests under the provisions of the PA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where requesters seek records about themselves which are not  contained in a PA system of records and cite or imply the PA, the  requests will be processed under the provisions of the FOIA, since they  have no access under the PA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where requesters seek records about themselves that are  contained in a PA system of records and cite or imply the FOIA or both  Acts, the requests will be processed under the time limits of the FOIA  and the exemptions and fees of the PA. This is appropriate since greater  access will generally be received under the PA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where requesters seek agency records (as opposed to personal  records) and cite or imply the PA and FOIA, or where requesters cite or  imply only the FOIA, the requests will be processed under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requesters will be advised in the final responses to their  requests why a particular Act was used in processing their requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Index and ``(a)(2)'' Materials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No order, opinion, statement  of policy, interpretation, staff manual or instruction (except as  indicated below) issued after July 4, 1967, which is not indexed and  either made available or published, may be relied upon, used, or cited  as a precedent against any member of the public unless that individual  has actual and timely notice of the contents of such materials. Such  actual and timely notice may not be after-the-fact; i.e., after the  individual has suffered some adverse effect. Materials identified as  ``(a)(2)'' are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions,  and orders made in the adjudication of cases, as defined in 5 U.S.C.  551, that may be cited, used, or relied upon as precedents in future  adjudications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted  by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Administrative staff manuals and instructions, or portions  thereof, that establish OIG policy or interpretations of policy that  affect a member of the public. This provision does not apply to  instructions for employees on tactics and techniques to be used in  performing their duties, or to instructions relating only to the  internal management of the OIG. Examples of manuals and instructions not  normally made available are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Those issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes,  or those that prescribe operational tactics, standards of performance,  or criteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information  concerning munitions, equipment, systems, and foreign intelligence  operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>'' requirements will be made available for public  inspection and copying upon written request to the address indicated in  Sec. 295.7(b)(1) of this part, unless such materials have been published  and are offered for sale or subscription. Upon receipt of the request,  arrangements will be made at a time convenient to both the requester and  the OIG, for the review and copying. If the publishing activity is out  of stock of the published, for sale material and does not intend to  reprint, then the preceding procedure will apply to the published  material as well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When appropriate, the cost of copying any ``(a)(2)'' materials  will be   imposed upon the individual requesting the copy in accordance with  chapter VI of DoD 5400.7-R (32 CFR part 286).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The OIG will prepare an index of ``(a)(2)'' materials, or  supplement thereto, arranged topically or by descriptive words rather  than by case name or numbering system so that members of the public can  readily locate material. Separate case name and numbering arrangements  may be added for OIG convenience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The IG has determined that it is not practical nor feasible to  prepare an index of the ``(a)(2)'' materials on a quarterly basis, nor  to publish the annual ``IG Publications Index'' in the Federal Register  because of the volume. This index is available to the public at no cost  upon written request to: Acquisition and Resources Administration  Directorate, Publications Management Branch, room 413, 400 Army Navy  Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22202-2884. It may be necessary to deny all  or portions of some documents listed in the index that fall within one  or more exemptions of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Fees and Fee Waivers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fees will be assessed under the FOIA  as set forth in chapter VI of DoD 5400.7-R (32 CFR part 286).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requesters must indicate their willingness to pay fees in their  initial FOIA request. If a waiver of fees is requested, a statement  regarding their willingness to pay fees in the event a waiver or  reduction of fees is denied is still required. Any requests not  containing a statement regarding a willingness to pay assessed fees will  not be processed and the requester will be so advised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fees will not be required to be paid in advance of processing  the request for release of the records requested except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the requester is known to be in default of payment of fees  incurred in connection with a previous request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the total amount of estimated fees assessable to the  requester exceeds $250.00 and waiver is not appropriate, a ``good  faith'' deposit of half of the amount of the estimated fees may be  required before completing the processing of the request, or providing  the requested records, in the case of a requester with no history of  payment. Where the requester has a history of prompt payment, the OIG  will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory  assurance of full payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the OIG has completed all work on a request and the  documents are ready for release, advance payment may be requested before  forwarding the documents if there is no payment history on the  requester. Where there is a history of prompt payment by the requester,  the OIG will not hold documents ready for release pending payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fee waivers will be granted on a case-by-case basis when the OIG  determines that waiver or reduction of the fees is in the public  interest because furnishing the information is likely to contribute  significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of  the OIG and the Department of Defense and is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester. In any request for waiver of fees,  the requester must provide sufficient information to enable the IDA to  make a proper determination of whether or not the fees should be waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In cases where the requester fails to provide sufficient  persuasive information upon which to make a determination for waiver of  the fees, the requester shall be so informed and given the opportunity  to submit additional justification. Absent such justification, the  requester may be required to pay fees appropriate to his/her category,  if provision of the information is determined not to be in the public  interest or benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Payments of fees must be by check or U.S. Postal money order  made payable to the Treasurer of the United States. Cash payments cannot  be accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Appeals and Judicial Action. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the designated IDA declines  to provide a requested record because the official considers it exempt  from disclosure under one or more of the nine exemptions of the FOIA,  that decision may be appealed by the requester to the designated  Appellate Authority. The appeal should be submitted in writing by the  requester within 60 calendar days after the date of the initial denial  letter. In cases where incremental release   actions have been taken on an initial request, the time for the appeal  will not begin until the date of the last denial of release letter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A ``no record'' finding may be considered to be adverse, and if  so interpreted by the requester, may be appealed using the normal OIG  appeal procedures. The OIG will conduct an additional search of files,  based on the receipt of an appeal to a ``no record'' response, as a part  of the appellate process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All final decisions rendered on appeals will be made to the  requesters in writing by the Appellate Authority, after consultation  with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) representative to the OIG, and  other appropriate OIG elements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final determinations on appeals normally shall be made within 20  working days after receipt. The appeal will be deemed to have been  received when it reaches the FOIA/PA Division, for administrative  processing on behalf of the Appellate Authority. Misdirected appeals are  to be referred expeditiously to the FOIA/PA Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A requester will be deemed to have exhausted his/her  administrative remedies after he/she has been denied the requested  record or waiver/reduction of fees, by the designated Appellate  Authority, or when the OIG FOIA/PA Division fails to respond to the  request within the time limits prescribed by the FOIA, DoD 5400.7-R (32  CFR part 286) and this part. The requester may then seek judicial action  from a U.S. Distrist Court in the district in which the requester  resides, has a principal place of business, in the district in which the  record is located, or in the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Records that are denied on appeal shall be retained for a period  of six years, in accordance with IGDM 5015.2, \2\ ``Records Management  Manual,'' to meet the statute of limitations of claims requirements. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 295.5(1). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Appendix to Sec. 295.5</p><p class="depth3">Extract</p><p class="depth3">The material contained herein is an Extract of information from  (Name of Original Document), which has been determined to be in the  public domain.
