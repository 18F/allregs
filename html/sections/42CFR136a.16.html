                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. Persons requesting  Beneficiary Identification Cards must submit or have on file evidence  satisfactory to the Indian Health Service of tribal membership and  residence within a Health Service Delivery Area. The absence of a  Beneficiary Identification Card will not preclude an otherwise eligible  Indian from obtaining services though it may delay the administrative  determination that an individual is eligible for services on a no charge  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For establishing eligibility or obtaining a Beneficiary  Identification Card, applicants must demonstrate that they are members  of a federally recognized tribe. Membership in a federally recognized  tribe is to be determined by the individual tribe or the Bureau of  Indian Affairs. Therefore, the Indian Health Service will recognize two  methods of demonstrating tribal membership:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documentation that the applicant meets the requirements of  tribal membership as prescribed by the charter, articles of  incorporation, or other legal instruments or traditional processes of  the tribe and has been officially designated a tribal member by an  authorized tribal official or body; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification of tribal enrollment or membership by the  Secretary of the Interior acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstrating membership in a federally recognized tribe is the  responsibility of the applicant. However, the Indian Health Service may  consult with the appropriate tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs on  outstanding questions regarding an applicant's tribal membership if the  Indian Health Service has some documentation that it believes may be  helpful to the tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs in making their  determination.
