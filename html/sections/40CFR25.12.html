                                Sec. 25.12  Assuring compliance with public participation
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Financial assistance programs--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications. EPA shall  review the public participation work plan (or, if no work plan is  required by this chapter for the particular financial assistance  agreement, the public participation element) included in the application  to determine consistency with all policies and requirements of this  part. No financial assistance shall be awarded unless EPA is satisfied  that the public participation policies and requirements of this part  and, any applicable public participation requirements found elsewhere in  this chapter, will be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation. EPA shall evaluate compliance with  public   participation requirements using the work plan, responsiveness summary,  and other available information. EPA will judge the adequacy of the  public participation effort in relation to the objectives and  requirements of Sec. 25.3 and Sec. 25.4 and other applicable  requirements. In conducting this evaluation, EPA may request additional  information from the assisted agency, including records of hearings and  meetings, and may invite public comment on the agency's performance. The  evaluation will be undertaken as part of any mid-project review required  in various programs under this chapter; where no such review is required  the review shall be conducted at an approximate mid-point in continuing  EPA oversight activity. EPA may, however, undertake such evaluation at  any point in the project period, and will do so whenever it believes  that an assisted agency may have failed to meet public participation  requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Remedial actions. Whenever EPA determines that an assisted  agency has not fully met public participation requirements, EPA shall  take actions which it deems appropriate to mitigate the adverse effects  of the failure and assure that the failure is not repeated. For ongoing  projects, that action shall include, at a minimum, imposing more  stringent requirements on the assisted agency for the next budget period  or other period of the project (including such actions as more specific  output requirements and milestone schedules for output achievement;  interim EPA review of public participation activities and materials  prepared by the agency, and phased release of funds based on compliance  with milestone schedules.) EPA may terminate or suspend part or all  financial assistance for non-compliance with public participation  requirements, and may take any further actions that it determines to be  appropriate in accordance with parts 30 and 35 of this chapter (see, in  particular, Secs. 30.340, Noncompliance and 30.615-3, Withholding of  Payments, and subpart H of part 30, Modification, Suspension, and  Termination).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State programs approved in lieu of Federal programs. State  compliance with applicable public participation requirements in programs  specified in Sec. 25.2(a) (6) and (7) and administered by approved  States shall be monitored by EPA during the annual review of the State's  program, and during any financial or program audit or review of these  programs. EPA may withdraw an approved program from a State for failure  to comply with applicable public participation requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other covered programs. Assuring compliance with these public  participation requirements for programs not covered by paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section is the responsibility of the Administrator of  EPA. Citizens with information concerning alleged failures to comply  with the public participation requirements should notify the  Administrator. The Administrator will assure that instances of alleged  non-compliance are promptly investigated and that corrective action is  taken where necessary.</p>
