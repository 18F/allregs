This amount will then be restated as the percentage of total price cap local exchange carrier Local Switching revenues as of June 30, 2000 using 2000 annual filing base period demand (``June 30 Local Switching revenues'') necessary to yield the total amount of additional reductions and taking into account the fact that, if participating, a price cap local exchange carrier would not reduce ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq).Each price cap local exchange carrier then reduces ATS rate elements, and associated SBI upper limits and PCIs, by a dollar amount equivalent to the percentage times the June 30 Local Switching revenues for that filing entity, provided that no price cap local exchange carrier shall be required to reduce its ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq).

For the purpose of targeting X-factor reductions, companies that allocate pooled local switching revenue to other filing entities pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(vii) of this section shall include pooled local switching revenue in the total revenue of the CMT basket of the filing entity from which the pooled local switching revenue originated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pooled local switching revenue shall be kept separate from CMT revenue in the CMT basket.

If pooled local switching revenue remains after applying amounts to the multi-line business SLC, notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 69.153 of this chapter, the remaining pooled local switching revenue may be added to the multi-line business PICC until the rate equals the nominal cap ($4.31) or the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated. Unallocated pooled local switching revenue may still remain. For companies pooling pursuant to paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section, these unallocated amounts may not be recovered from the CCL charge, the primary residential and single-line business SLC, a non-primary residential SLC, or from CMT elements in any other filing entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For companies pooling pursuant to paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section, pooled local switching revenue that can not be allocated to the multi-line business PICC and multi-line business SLC rates within an individual filing entity may not be recovered from the CCL charge, primary residential and single-line business SLC or residential/single-line business SLC charges, but may be allocated to other filing entities within the holding company, and collected by adding these amounts to the multi-line business PICC and multi-line business SLC rates. The allocation of pooled local switching revenue among filing entities will be re-calculated at each annual filing. In subsequent annual filings, pooled local switching revenue that was allocated to another filing entity will be reallocated to the filing entity from where it originated, to the full extent permitted by the nominal caps of $9.20 and $4.31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 69.152(k) of this chapter, these unallocated local switching revenues that cannot be recovered fully pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(vii) of this section are first added to the multi-line business SLC of other filing entities until the resulting rate equals the nominal cap ($9.20) or the pooled local switching revenue for the holding company is fully allocated. If the pooled local switching revenue can be fully allocated to the multi-line business SLC, the amount is distributed to each filing entity with a rate below the nominal cap ($9.20) based on its below-cap multi-line business SLC revenue as a

percentage of the total holding company's below-cap multi-line business SLC revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> If pooled local switching revenue remains after applying amounts to the multi-line business SLC of all filing entities in the holding company, pooled local switching revenue may be added to the multi-line business PICC of other filing entities. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 69.153 of this chapter, the remaining pooled local switching revenue is distributed to each filing entity with a rate below the nominal cap ($4.31) based on its below-cap multi-line business PICC revenue as a percentage of the total holding company's below-cap multi-line business PICC revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If pooled local switching revenue is added to the multi-line business SLC but not to the multi-line business PICC for a filing entity that qualified to deaverage SLCs without regard to pooled local switching revenue, the resulting SLC rates can still be deaveraged. Total pooled local switching revenue is added to the deaveraged zone 1 multi-line business SLC rate until the per line rate in zone 1 equals the rate in zone 2 or until the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated to the deaveraged multi-line business SLC rate for zone 1. If pooled local switching revenue remains after the rate in zone 1 equals zone 2, the deaveraged rates of zone 1 and zone 2 are increased until the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated to the deaveraged multi-line business SLC rates of zone 1 and 2 or until those rates reach the zone 3 multi-line business SLC rate level.

If those properties are merged into a filing entity with a different Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq), the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq) for the merged filing entity will be the weighted average of the Target Rates as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq) for the properties being combined into a single filing entity, with the average weighted by local switching minutes.
