                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section governs service of documents required to  be made under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type of service. A person may serve documents by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personal delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mail, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic mail or facsimile transmission, if consented to in  writing by the person served, except that such service is not effective  if the party making service receives credible information indicating  that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a party serves a pleading on another party during the course  of hearing proceedings by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, the  party making service must file with the Enforcement Docket Clerk a copy  of the consent of the receiving party to accept such method of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of service. The date of service will be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of personal delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If mailed, the mailing date stated on the certificate of  service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of  service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no  certificate of service or postmark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If sent by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, the date  of transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Valid service. A document served by mail or personal delivery  that was properly addressed, was sent in accordance with this part, and  that was returned, that was not claimed, or that was refused, is deemed  to have been served in accordance with this part. The service will be  considered valid as of the date and the time that the document was  deposited with a contract or express messenger, the document was mailed,  or personal delivery of the document was attempted and refused.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Presumption of service. There will be a presumption of service  where a party or a person, who customarily receives mail, or receives it  in the ordinary course of business, at either the person's residence or  the person's principal place of business, acknowledges receipt of the  document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party has a  right or a duty to act or to make any response within a prescribed  period after service by mail, or on a date certain after service by  mail, 5 days will be added to the prescribed period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Service of documents filed with the Enforcement Docket. A person  must serve a copy of any document filed with the Enforcement Docket on  each party and the ALJ or the chief ALJ if no judge has been assigned to  the proceeding at the time of filing. Service on a party's attorney of  record or a party's designated representative is service on the party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Certificate of service. Each party must attach a certificate of  service to any document tendered for filing with the Enforcement Docket  Clerk. A certificate of service must consist of a statement, dated and  signed by the person who effected service, of the name(s) of the  person(s) served, and the method by which each person was served and the  date that the service was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Service by the ALJ. The ALJ must serve a copy of each document  he or she issues including, but not limited to, notices of pre-hearing  conferences   and hearings, rulings on motions, decisions, and orders, upon each party  to the proceedings.</p>
