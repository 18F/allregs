                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> AM stations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this  section, the antenna input power of an AM station as determined by the  procedures specified in Sec.  73.51 must be maintained as near as is  practicable to the authorized antenna input power and may not be less  than 90% nor more than 105% of the authorized power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever the transmitter of an AM station cannot be placed into  the specified operating mode at the time required, transmissions of the  station must be immediately terminated. However, if the radiated field  at any bearing or elevation does not exceed that permitted for that time  of day, operation in the mode with the lesser radiated field may  continue under the notification procedures of paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FM stations. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section, the transmitter output power of an FM station, with power  output as determined by the procedures specified in Sec.  73.267, which  is authorized for output power more than 10 watts must be maintained as  near as practicable to the authorized transmitter output power and may  not be less than 90% nor more than 105% of the authorized power. FM  stations operating with authorized transmitter output power of 10 watts  or less, may operate at less than the authorized power, but not more  than 105% of the authorized power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TV stations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section, the visual output power of a TV or Class A TV transmitter, as  determined by the procedures specified in Sec. 73.664, must be  maintained as near as is practicable to the authorized transmitter  output power and may not be less than 80% nor more than 110% of the  authorized power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The output power of the aural transmitter shall be maintained to  provide an aural carrier ERP not to exceed 22% of the peak authorized  visual ERP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FCC may specify deviation from the power of tolerance  requirements for subscription television operations to the extent it  deems necessary to permit proper operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reduced power operation. In the event it becomes technically  impossible to operate at authorized power, a broadcast station may  operate at reduced power for a period of not more than 30 days without  specific authority from the FCC. If operation at reduced power will  exceed 10 consecutive days, notification must be made to the FCC in  Washington, DC, Attention: Audio Division (radio) or Video Division  (television), Media Bureau, not later than the 10th day of the lower  power operation. In the event that normal power is restored within the  30 day period, the licensee must notify the FCC of the date that normal  operation was restored. If causes beyond the control of the licensee  prevent restoration of the authorized power within 30 days, a request  for Special Temporary Authority (see Sec.  73.1635) must be made to the  FCC in Washington, DC for additional time as may be necessary.
