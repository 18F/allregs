                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Every loan or finance company shall file with  FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required by this section, a  report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of  law or regulation. A loan or finance company may also file with FinCEN a  report of any suspicious transaction that it believes is relevant to the  possible violation of any law or regulation, but whose reporting is not  required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A transaction requires reporting under this section if it is  conducted or attempted by, at, or through a loan or finance company, it  involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000, and the  loan or finance company knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that  the transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction  is a part):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or  conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from  illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature,  source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan  to violate or evade any Federal law or regulation or to avoid any  transaction reporting requirement under Federal law or regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to  evade any requirements of this part or any other regulations promulgated  under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, codified at  12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314, 5316- 5332;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort  in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage,  and the loan or finance company knows of no reasonable explanation for  the transaction after examining the available facts, including the  background and possible purpose of the transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Involves use of the loan or finance company to facilitate  criminal activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than one loan or finance company may have an obligation to  report the same transaction under this section, and other financial  institutions may have separate obligations to report suspicious activity  with respect to the same transaction pursuant to other provisions of  this part. In those instances, no more than one report is required to be  filed by the loan or finance company(s) and other financial  institution(s) involved in the transaction, provided that the report  filed contains all relevant facts, including the name of each financial  institution involved in the transaction, the report complies with all  instructions applicable to joint filings, and each institution maintains  a copy of the report filed, along with any supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing and notification procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What to file. A  suspicious transaction shall be reported by completing a Suspicious  Activity Report (``SAR''), and collecting and maintaining supporting  documentation as required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where to file. The SAR shall be filed with FinCEN in accordance  with the instructions to the SAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When to file. A SAR shall be filed no later than 30 calendar  days after the date of the initial detection by the reporting loan or  finance company of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR  under this section. If no suspect is identified on the date of such  initial detection, a loan or finance company may delay filing a SAR for  an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect, but in no case  shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of  such initial detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mandatory notification to law enforcement. In situations  involving violations that require immediate attention, such as suspected  terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering schemes, a loan or  finance company shall immediately notify by telephone   an appropriate law enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a  SAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Voluntary notification to FinCEN. Any loan or finance company  wishing voluntarily to report suspicious transactions that may relate to  terrorist activity may call the FinCEN's Financial Institutions Hotline  at 1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing timely a SAR if required by this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Retention of records. A loan or finance company shall maintain a  copy of any SAR filed by the loan or finance company or on its behalf  (including joint reports), and the original (or business record  equivalent) of any supporting documentation concerning any SAR that it  files (or is filed on its behalf), for a period of five years from the  date of filing the SAR. Supporting documentation shall be identified as  such and maintained by the loan or finance company, and shall be deemed  to have been filed with the SAR. The loan or finance company shall make  all supporting documentation available to FinCEN, or any Federal, State,  or local law enforcement agency, or any Federal regulatory authority  that examines the loan or finance company for compliance with the Bank  Secrecy Act, or any State regulatory authority administering a State law  that requires the loan or finance company to comply with the Bank  Secrecy Act or otherwise authorizes the State authority to ensure that  the loan or finance company complies with the Bank Secrecy Act, upon  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> only, a SAR shall include any suspicious activity  report filed with FinCEN pursuant to any regulation in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prohibition on disclosures by loan or finance companies--(i)  General rule. No loan or finance company, and no director, officer,  employee, or agent of any loan or finance company, shall disclose a SAR  or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR. Any loan or  finance company, and any director, officer, employee, or agent of any  loan or finance company that is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to  disclose a SAR or any information that would reveal the existence of a  SAR, shall decline to produce the SAR or such information, citing this  section and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)(A)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, and shall notify FinCEN of any  such request and the response thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules of construction. Provided that no person involved in any  reported suspicious transaction is notified that the transaction has  been reported, paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be construed  as prohibiting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The disclosure by a loan or finance company, or any director,  officer, employee, or agent of a loan or finance company of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a  SAR, to FinCEN or any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency,  any Federal regulatory authority that examines the loan or finance  company for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, or any State  regulatory authority administering a State law that requires the loan or  finance company to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act or otherwise  authorizes the State authority to ensure that the loan or finance  company complies with the Bank Secrecy Act; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The underlying facts, transactions, and documents upon which a  SAR is based, including, but not limited to, disclosures to another  financial institution, or any director, officer, employee, or agent of a  financial institution, for the preparation of a joint SAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sharing by a loan or finance company, or any director,  officer, employee, or agent of the loan or finance company, of a SAR, or  any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, within the  loan or finance company's corporate organizational structure for  purposes consistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act as determined  by regulation or in guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibition on disclosures by government authorities. A Federal,  state, local, territorial, or tribal government authority, or any  director, officer, employee, or agent of any of the foregoing, shall not  disclose a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a  SAR, except as necessary   to fulfill official duties consistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy  Act. For purposes of this section, official duties shall not include the  disclosure of a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence  of a SAR, in response to a request for disclosure of non-public  information or a request for use in a private legal proceeding,  including a request pursuant to 31 CFR 1.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on liability. A loan or finance company, and any  director, officer, employee, or agent of any loan or finance company,  that makes a voluntary disclosure of any possible violation of law or  regulation to a government agency or makes a disclosure pursuant to this  section or any other authority, including a disclosure made jointly with  another institution, shall be protected from liability for any such  disclosure, or for failure to provide notice of such disclosure to any  person identified in the disclosure, or both, to the full extent  provided by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Compliance. Loan or finance companies shall be examined by  FinCEN or its delegates under the terms of the Bank Secrecy Act, for  compliance with this section. Failure to satisfy the requirements of  this section may be a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and of this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Compliance date. This section applies to transactions initiated  after an anti-money laundering program required by section 1029.210 of  this part is required to be implemented.</p>
