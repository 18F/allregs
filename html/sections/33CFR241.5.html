                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Step one, the benefits test. Determine the maximum possible reduction in the level of non-Federal cost-sharing for any project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the ratio of flood control benefits (developed using the Water Resources Council's Principles and Guidelines--ref. Sec. 241.3(b)) to flood control costs for the project based on the discount rate which the Corps is currently using to evaluate projects. Costs include operations and maintenance as well as first costs. Divide the result by four. For example, if the project's (or separable element's) benefit-cost ratio is 1.2:1, the factor for this project equals 0.3. If a project has been authorized for construction without a benefit-cost ratio calculated in accordance with the Principles and Guidelines, determination of the ratio is a prerequisite for consideration under the ability to pay provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the factor determined in Sec. 241.5(a)(1), when expressed as a percentage, is greater than the standard level of cost-sharing, the standard level will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the factor determined in Sec. 241.5(a)(1), when expressed as a percentage, is less than the standard level of cost-sharing, projects may be eligible for either a reduction in the non-Federal share to this ``benefits based floor'' (BBF), or for a partial reduction to a share between the standard level and the BBF, as determined by the procedures in step two, Sec. 243.5. In no case however, will the non-Federal cost-share be less than five percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step two, the income test. Projects may qualify for the full amount of the reduction in cost-sharing calculated in Step one, or for some fraction of the reduction in cost-sharing, depending on a measure of the current economic resources of the project area and of the state or states in which the project is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To assure consistency, the calculations in Sec. 241.5(b) (2) and (3) will be performed by HQUSACE and distributed to all FOA's via Engineering Circulars. The information will be updated and distributed to HQUSACE and to the field as soon as new data are available. The procedures may be verified for any single county or state using the sources cited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each of the three latest calendar years for which information is available, determine the level of per capita personal income in the state in

which the project beneficiaries are located, and compare this to the national average of per capita personal income. Source: Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as published yearly in the April Survey of Current Business. (If the project beneficiaries are located in Alaska or Hawaii, divide the per capita personal income figure by one plus the percentage used in the Federal Government's cost of living pay differential for Federal workers who purchase local retail and who use private housing, employed in Anchorage, AK or Oahu, HI as contained in References Sec. 241.3(c) and (d).) Determine the state's per capita personal income as an index number in comparision to the national average (U.S.=100), and calculate the three year average of the state's index number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each of the three latest calendar years for which information is available, determine the level of per capita personal income in the county where the project beneficiaries are located (the ``project area''), and compare this to the national average of per capita personal income. Source: Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as published yearly in the April Survey of Current Business. (If the project beneficiaries are located in Alaska or Hawaii, divide the county's per capita personal income figure by one plus the percentage used in the Federal Government's cost of living pay differential for Federal workers who purchase local retail and who use private housing, employed in Anchorage, AK or Oahu, HI.) Calculate the index for the county's per capita personal income to the national average (U.S.=100), and calculate the three year average of the county's index number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When the project area, as determined by the location of the project's beneficiaries, includes more than one county, calculate a composite project area index by taking a weighted average of the county index numbers, the weights being equal to the relative levels of benefits received in each county. When the project area includes more than one state, the state index for the project should be calculated using the same weighting technique.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Calculate an ``Eligibility Factor'' for the project according to the following formula:
EF = a - b1 x (state factor) - b2 x (area factor).

If EF is one or more, the project is eligible for the full reduction in cost-share to the benefits based floor. If EF is zero or less, the project is not eligible for a reduction. If EF is between zero and one, the non-Federal cost-share will be reduced proportionately to an amount which is greater than the BBF but less than the standard non-Federal cost-share in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph Sec. 241.5(c) of this part. The values of a, b1 and b2 will be determined by HQUSACE. The parameter values will be based on the latest available data and set so that 20 percent of counties have an EF of 1.0 or more, while 66.7 percent have an EF of 0 or less. These values will be adjusted periodically as new information becomes available. Changes will be published in Engineering Circulars. The values will be set so that b2=2xb1, giving local income twice the weight of state income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Since estimates (available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis) of per capita personal income for Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. territories are well below the national average, the eligibility factor for projects in these areas is administratively established to be equal to 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For flood control projects sponsored by Native American tribes or villages, the EF shall be calculated using information on tribe or village income as a replacement factor for both the area and state factor (that is multiply the replacement income factor by both b1 and b2 and subtract each from a in the equation in Sec. 241.5(b)(5)). The replacement factor will be tribe or village income as a percentage of the national average for the equivalent definition of income (for example a Tribe's median family income as a percentage of the median family income for all U.S. families). The data should be the latest available information. It is acceptable, but not required that the data be obtained from the Bureau of the Census, American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts on Identified Reservations and

in Historic Areas of Oklahoma (Excluding Urbanized Areas), part 1, Table 10, or General Social and Economic Characteristics--United States Summary (1980), Table 252. Since both sources contain information for Native Americans living on reservations, rather than all Tribe or Village members, the sources should be used only when appropriate, or when no better information is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of the Ability to Pay Formula to the Basic Cost-sharing Provisions of Section 103. If a flood control project has a BBF which is less than the standard cost-share and an EF which is greater than zero, the non-Federal cost-share will be reduced. The alternative non-Federal share will be calculated and reported to the nearest one tenth of one percent. The actual reduction is determined by applying the ability to pay formula to the basic flood control cost-sharing provisions of section 103 of Pub. L. 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When EF "1, non-Federal cost-share = BBF</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For structural projects covered by section 103(a), when 0 Sec. 241.6  Deferred payments for certain qualifying projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a project's Eligibility Factor exceeds zero, the project sponsor will be permitted to defer a portion of its share of flood control costs. The maximum allowable amount deferred equals the total non-Federal share less (for structural projects) five percent of total project costs and less (for all projects) any amounts for LERRD paid for or acquired by the sponsor prior to the time the PCA is signed. If for example, the non-Federal share of a structural project = 35.0 percent (after the ability to pay adjustment, if any) of which 10 percent is LERRD already paid for by the local sponsor, the maximum allowable amount to be deferred = 20 percent of project flood control costs (35 less the 5 percent cash requirements, less the 10 percent LERRD already acquired). Deferred payments at the option of the sponsor will be allowed regardless of the outcome of the benefits test described in Sec. 241.5(a) whenever the Eligibility Factor exceeds zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When EF "1, the project sponsor may defer as much as the maximum allowable amount as described in Sec. 241.6(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When 0 Sec. 241.7  Application of test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A preliminary ability to pay test will be applied during the study phase of any proposed project. If the ability to pay cost-share is lower than the standard share, the revised estimated cost-share will be used for budgetary and other planning purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The official application of the ability to pay test will be made at the time the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the Corps of Engineers and the Non-Federal sponsor is signed. For structural flood control projects, the standard level of cost-sharing will not be known until the end of the project (since the standard level as specified in section 103(a), 33 U.S.C. 2213, includes LERRD). In this case, if the Eligibility Factor is greater than zero but less than one, the ability to pay non-Federal share will be determined using estimated costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The PCA for all projects subject to the ability to pay test will include a ``whereas'' clause indicating the results of the test. If the project is eligible for a lower non-Federal share:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The revised share will be specified in the PCA (there will be no recalculation of this share once the PCA is signed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An exhibit attached to the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) will include the Benefits Based Floor (BBF) determined in Sec. 241.5(a): the Eligibility Factor (EF) determined in Sec. 241.5(b): If the Eligibility Factor is greater than zero but less than one, the estimated standard non-Federal share; the formula used in determining the ability to pay share as described in Sec. 241.5(c)(1) through (c)(4); and a display of the non-Federal cost share under the high cost criteria described in Sec. 241.5(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If at the time of project completion, the standard non-Federal share based on actual costs is less than the ability to pay share specified in the PCA, the standard share will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For structural projects. (1) If the standard LERRD plus cash requirement exceeds the ability to pay cost-share, the Federal Government will make any necessary adjustments in expenditures in the following order: First, paying any cash requirement in excess of five percent of total project costs (if any) that would, under standard cost-sharing, have been the responsibility of the non-Federal sponsor; second, making payments for LERRD; and third, providing for reimbursement at the end of construction. Federal payments for LERRD will be made only after the non-Federal payment for LERRD reaches a percentage of total project costs equal to the ability to pay non-Federal cost-share less the five percent cash requirement. If such arrangements are necessary, the PCA should be prepared to reflect agreement on the best manner available for acquisition of those LERRD over the limiting percentage, or for reimbursing the sponsor upon completion of construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The non-Federal sponsor will be required to provide a cash payment equal to the minimum of five percent of estimated project costs, regardless of the outcome of the ability to pay test, unless any or all of the five percent cash requirement is waived by application of the high cost criteria described in Sec. 241.5(d). The project sponsor shall make cash payments during construction at a rate such that the amount of non-Federal payments in each year, as a percentage of total non-Federal cash payments, equals the

amount of Federal expenditures (including sunk pre-construction engineering and design costs as a first year Federal construction expenditure) as a percentage of total Federal expenditures. Total Federal expenditures include cash payments for construction and if necessary (due to ability to pay considerations), for LERRD, and for reimbursement to the non-Federal sponsor. Total Federal expenditures for the purpose of this calculation, do not include expenditures which allow the non-Federal sponsor to defer payment of the non-Federal share under the provisions of this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For non-structural projects, reductions in the non-Federal cost-share as a result of the ability to pay test will not affect the procedures for determining the non-Federal and Federal payment schedules. For non-structural projects, no specific cash payments during construction are required by law.
