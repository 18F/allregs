                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the watch requirement contained in Sec. 80.148, all vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act must keep a watch on the designated navigational frequency. The watch must be maintained by the master or person in charge of the vessel or the person designated by the master or person in charge to pilot or direct the movement of the vessel. The person standing watch may perform other duties provided such other duties do not interfere with the watch.
