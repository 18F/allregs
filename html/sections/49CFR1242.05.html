                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes natural expenses; the second group denotes activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The symbol ``XX'' in the first two-digit group is used throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers represented by ``XX'' include:
11--Salaries and wages;21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants;30 or 41--Purchased services:</p><p class="depth2">30--Summation of certain purchased service accounts;</p><p class="depth2">41--Other purchased services;61--General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ``30'' natural expense designation indicates a summation of specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding administration functions, the ``30'' designation denotes the summation of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The ``41'' natural expense designation (other purchased services) is the purchased service category of the ``XX'' code for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Way and structures activity administration--function accounts,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment activity administration--function accounts,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transportation activity expense accounts, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General and administration activity expense accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The ``61'' general natural expense designation is applicable to all accounts with the ``XX'' symbol except transportation, train and yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The natural expense account number ``50'' is used throughout the separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one item, ``Casualties and Insurance,'' (50-XX-XX).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The number ``98'' in the function account group (last two digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.--Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.</p>
