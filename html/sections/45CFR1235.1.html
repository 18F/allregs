                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part and in section 224 of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, as amended, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Director means the Director of ACTION.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Locally Generated Contributions means all contributions generated by the grantee in support of the grant, including non-ACTION Federal, State, local government and privately raised contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount Required by the Director means the proportion of the non-Federal contribution (including in-kind contributions) for a grant or contract made under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, as amended, required by the Director in order to receive ACTION funds. This proportion is generally 10% for the Foster Grandparent Program/Senior Companion Program (FGP/SCP) and generally 10%, 20% and 30% for the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) in the first, second, and subsequent years respectively. The ``amount required by the Director'' is also called the ``local match.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In Excess of the Amount Required by the Director means of the total locally generated contributions, the amount over and above the percentage match (generally 10% for FGP/SCP and 10%, 20% and 30% for RSVP in the first, second, and subsequent years respectively) required by the Director of ACTION to be raised from non-ACTION sources to support the grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inconsistent with the Provisions of This Act means expenditures not in support of ACTION programs, as defined by the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, as amended. For example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inconsistency with the age threshold for volunteers for all Older American Volunteer Programs (OAVP);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inconsistency with the low income test for the FGP and SCP programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Variations from the approved stipend levels for the FGP and SCP programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inconsistency with the prohibition against political activity under all the OAVP programs; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unreasonable cost for a low-cost volunteer program.</p>
