                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of achieving the objectives and performance  factors of Sec. 312.20(e) and (f), the inquiry of the environmental  professional must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A visual on-site inspection of the subject property and  facilities and improvements on the subject property, including a visual  inspection of the areas where hazardous substances may be or may have  been used, stored, treated, handled, or disposed. Physical limitations  to the visual inspection must be noted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A visual inspection of adjoining properties, from the subject  property line, public rights-of-way, or other vantage point (e.g.,  aerial photography), including a visual inspection of areas where  hazardous substances may be or may have been stored, treated, handled or  disposed. Physical limitations to the inspection of adjacent properties  must be noted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons conducting site characterization and assessments using a  grant awarded under CERCLA section 104(k)(2)(B) must include in the  inquiries referenced in Sec. 312.27(a) visual inspections of areas  where hazardous substances, and may include, as applicable per the terms  and conditions of the grant or cooperative agreement, pollutants and  contaminants, petroleum and petroleum products, and controlled  substances as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802 may be or may have been used,  stored, treated, handled or disposed at the subject property and  adjoining properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as noted in this subsection, a visual on-site inspection  of the subject property must be conducted. In the unusual circumstance  where an on-site visual inspection of the subject property cannot be  performed because of physical limitations, remote and inaccessible  location, or other inability to obtain access to the property, provided  good faith (as defined in Sec. 312.10) efforts have been taken to  obtain such access, an on-site inspection will not be required. The mere  refusal of a voluntary seller to provide access to the subject property  does not constitute an unusual circumstance. In such unusual  circumstances, the inquiry of the environmental professional must  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visually inspecting the subject property via another method  (such as aerial imagery for large properties), or visually inspecting  the subject property from the nearest accessible vantage point (such as  the property line or public road for small properties);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation of efforts undertaken to obtain access and an  explanation of why such efforts were unsuccessful; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation of other sources of information regarding releases  or threatened releases at the subject property that were consulted in  accordance with Sec. 312.20(e). Such documentation should include  comments by the environmental professional on the significance of the  failure to conduct a visual on-site inspection of the subject property  with regard to the ability to identify conditions indicative of releases  or threatened releases on, at, in, or to the subject property, if any.</p>
