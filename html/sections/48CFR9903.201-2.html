                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Full coverage. Full coverage requires that the business unit  comply with all of the CAS specified in part 9904 that are in effect on  the date of the contract award and with any CAS that become applicable  because of later award of a CAS-covered contract. Full coverage applies  to contractor business units that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receive a single CAS-covered contract award of $50 million or  more; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Received $50 million or more in net CAS-covered awards during  its preceding cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Modified coverage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Modified CAS coverage requires only that  the contractor comply with Standard 9904.401, Consistency in Estimating,  Accumulating, and Reporting Costs, Standard 9904.402, Consistency in  Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same Purpose, Standard 9904.405,  Accounting for Unallowable Costs and Standard 9904.406, Cost Accounting  Standard--Cost Accounting Period. Modified, rather, than full, CAS  coverage may be applied to a covered contract of less than $50 million  awarded to a business unit that received less than $50 million in net  CAS-covered awards in the immediately preceding cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If any one contract is awarded with modified CAS coverage, all  CAS-covered contracts awarded to that business unit during that cost  accounting period must also have modified coverage with the following  exception: if the business unit receives a single CAS-covered contract  award of $50 million or more, that contract must be subject to full CAS  coverage. Thereafter, any covered contract awarded in the same cost  accounting period must also be subject to full CAS coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A contract awarded with modified CAS coverage shall remain  subject to such coverage throughout its life regardless of changes in  the business unit's CAS status during subsequent cost accounting  periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Coverage for educational institutions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Regulatory  requirements. Parts 9903 and 9905 apply to educational institutions  except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c) and at 9903.202-1(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of  this subsection below requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">Educational institution means a public or nonprofit institution of  higher education, e.g., an accredited college or university, as defined  in section 1201(a) of Public Law 89-329, November 8, 1965, Higher  Education Act of 1965; (20 U.S.C. 1141(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this  chapter 99 are applicable to educational institutions:</p><p class="depth0">Business unit means any segment of an educational institution, or an  entire educational institution which is not divided into segments.</p><p class="depth0">Segment means one of two or more divisions, campus locations, or  other subdivisions of an educational institution that operate as  independent organizational entities under the auspices of the parent  educational institution and report directly to an intermediary group  office or the governing central system office of the parent educational  institution. Two schools of instruction operating under one division,  campus location or other subdivision would not be separate segments  unless they follow different cost accounting practices, for example, the  School of Engineering should not be treated as a separate segment from  the School of Humanities if they both are part of the same division's  cost accounting system and are subject to the same cost accounting  practices. The term includes Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO)  facilities, Federally Funded Research and Developments Centers (FFRDCs),  and joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the  institution has a majority ownership. The term also includes those joint  ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the  institution has less than a majority of ownership, but over which it  exercises control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable standards. Coverage for educational institutions  requires that the business unit comply with all of the CAS specified in  part 9905 that are in effect on the date of the contract award and with  any CAS that become applicable because of later award of a CAS-covered  contract. This coverage applies to business units that receive  negotiated contracts in excess of the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)  threshold, as adjusted for inflation (41 U.S.C. 1908 and 41 U.S.C.  1502(b)(1)(B)), except for CAS-covered contracts awarded to FFRDCs  operated by an educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> FFRDCs. Negotiated contracts awarded to an FFRDC operated by an  educational institution are subject to the full or modified CAS coverage  prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection. CAS-covered  FFRDC contracts shall be excluded from the institution's universe of  contracts when determining CAS applicability and disclosure requirements  for contracts other than those to be performed by the FFRDC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Contract clauses. The contract clause at 9903.201-4(e) shall be  incorporated in each negotiated contract and subcontract awarded to an  educational institution when the negotiated contract or subcontract  price exceeds the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) threshold, as  adjusted for inflation (41 U.S.C. 1908 and 41 U.S.C. 1502(b)(1)(B)). For  CAS-covered contracts awarded to an FFRDC operated by an educational  institution, however, the full or modified CAS contract clause specified  at 9903.201-4(a) or (c), as applicable, shall be incorporated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Continuity in fully CAS-covered contracts. Where existing  contracts awarded to an educational institution incorporate full CAS  coverage, the contracting officer may continue to apply full CAS  coverage, as prescribed at 9903.201-2(a), in future awards made to that  educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subcontracts. Subcontract awards subject to CAS require the same  type of CAS coverage as would prime contracts awarded to the same  business unit. In measuring total net CAS-covered awards for a year, a  transfer by one segment to another shall be deemed to be a subcontract  award by the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Foreign concerns. Contracts with foreign concerns subject to CAS  shall only be subject to Standard 9904.401,   Consistency in Estimating, Accumulating, and Reporting Costs, and  Standard 9904.402, Consistency in Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same  Purpose.
