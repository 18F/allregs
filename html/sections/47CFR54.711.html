                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contributions shall be calculated and filed in accordance with  the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet which shall be published in  the Federal Register. The Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet sets  forth information that the contributor must submit to the Administrator  on a quarterly and annual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public  Notice published in the Federal Register and on its website the manner  of payment and dates by which payments must be made. An executive  officer of the contributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of  historical data included in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet,  and that any projections in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet  represent a good-faith estimate based on the contributor's policies and  procedures. The Commission or the Administrator may verify any  information contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet.  Contributors shall maintain records and documentation to justify  information reported in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet,  including the methodology used to determine projections, for three years  and shall provide such records and documentation to the Commission or  the Administrator upon request. Inaccurate or untruthful information  contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to  prosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The Administrator shall advise the Commission of any  enforcement issues that arise and provide any suggested response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the  Administrator. Contributors may make requests for Commission  nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under Sec. 0.459  of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting  Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The  Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company- specific information. The Administrator shall keep confidential all data  obtained from contributors, shall not use such data except for purposes  of administering the universal service support programs, and shall not  disclose such data in company-specific form unless directed to do so by  the Commission. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Chief of the  Wireline Competition Bureau, the Universal Service Administrator may  share data obtained from contributors with the administrators of the  North American Numbering Plan administration cost recovery (See 47 CFR  52.16 of this chapter), the local number portability cost recovery (See  47 CFR 52.32 of this chapter), and the TRS Fund (See 47 CFR  64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter). The Administrator shall keep  confidential all data obtained from other administrators and shall not  use such data except for purposes of administering the universal service  support mechanisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or eliminate contributor  reporting requirements that prove unnecessary and require additional  reporting requirements that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound and  efficient administration of the universal service support mechanisms.
