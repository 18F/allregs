The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.</p>
