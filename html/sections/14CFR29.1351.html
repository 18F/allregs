The required generating capacity and  the number and kind of power sources must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be determined by an electrical load analysis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet the requirements of Sec. 29.1309.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generating system. The generating system includes electrical  power sources, main power busses, transmission cables, and associated  control, regulation, and protective devices. It must be designed so  that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Power sources function properly when independent and when  connected in combination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No failure or malfunction of any power source can create a  hazard or impair the ability of remaining sources to supply essential  loads;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system voltage and frequency (as applicable) at the  terminals of essential load equipment can be maintained within the  limits for which the   equipment is designed, during any probable operating condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> System transients due to switching, fault clearing, or other  causes do not make essential loads inoperative, and do not cause a smoke  or fire hazard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> There are means accessible in flight to appropriate crewmembers  for the individual and collective disconnection of the electrical power  sources from the main bus; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There are means to indicate to appropriate crewmembers the  generating system quantities essential for the safe operation of the  system, such as the voltage and current supplied by each generator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> External power. If provisions are made for connecting external  power to the rotorcraft, and that external power can be electrically  connected to equipment other than that used for engine starting, means  must be provided to ensure that no external power supply having a  reverse polarity, or a reverse phase sequence, can supply power to the  rotorcraft's electrical system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operation with the normal electrical power generating system  inoperative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It must be shown by analysis, tests, or both, that the  rotorcraft can be operated safely in VFR conditions for a period of not  less than 5 minutes, with the normal electrical power generating system  (electrical power sources excluding the battery) inoperative, with  critical type fuel (from the standpoint of flameout and restart  capability), and with the rotorcraft initially at the maximum  certificated altitude.
