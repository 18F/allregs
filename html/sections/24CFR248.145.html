                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval. The Commissioner may approve a plan of action for  extension of the low income affordability restrictions on an eligible  low income housing project or for transfer of the housing to a qualified  purchaser, other than a resident council acquiring the project under a  resident homeownership plan, only upon a finding that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of  incentives set forth in the plan of action is, for the Federal  Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the  full achievement of the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The project will be retained as housing affordable for very low,  low   and moderate income families and persons, as determined under paragraph  (a)(8) of this section, for the remaining useful life of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Throughout the remaining useful life of the project, adequate  expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the project  and the project meets the housing standards established in Sec. 248.147  as determined by inspections conducted by the Commissioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced, except for  good cause;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be  to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the  tenant or the fair market rent, whichever is lower. However, the rent  contributions of any tenants occupying the project at the time of any  increase may not be reduced by reason of this paragraph, except with  respect to tenants receiving section 8 assistance in accordance with  paragraph (a)(7) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for  increases made necessary by increased operating costs) shall be phased  in as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If such increase is 30 percent or more, the increase shall be  phased in equally over a period of not less than three years, with the  first increase occurring upon the effective date of the plan of action,  and the subsequent two increases occurring annually thereafter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30  percent, it shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Section 8 assistance shall be provided, to the extent  appropriations are available, if necessary to mitigate any adverse  effect on current very low and low income tenants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at  levels approved by the Commissioner, taking into account any incentives  provided under subpart B of this part, that will ensure, to the extent  practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same  proportions of very low, low and moderate income families and persons,  including families and persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of  area median income, as based on the area median income limits  established by the Commissioner in February 1987, as resided in the  project as of the date of the tenant income profile submitted under  Sec. 248.135(e)(5), or the date the plan of action is approved,  whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low income  families. This limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very  low income families and persons from occupying the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Future rent adjustments shall be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Made by applying an annual factor, to be determined by the  Commissioner, to the portion of rent attributable to operating expenses  for the project, and, where the owner is a priority purchaser, to the  portion of rent attributable to project oversight costs, as that term is  defined in Sec. 248.101; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to a procedure, established by the Commissioner, for  owners to apply for rent increases not adequately compensated by annual  adjustment under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, under which the  Commissioner may increase rents in excess of the amount determined under  paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section only if the Commissioner determines  such increases are necessary to reflect extraordinary necessary expenses  of owning and maintaining the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Any savings from reductions in operating expenses due to  management efficiencies shall be deposited in project reserves for  replacement and the owner shall have periodic access to such reserves,  to the extent the Commissioner determines that the level of the reserves  is adequate and that the project is maintained in accordance with the  standards established in Sec. 248.147;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The mortgage on the project is current; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> There are no open audit findings, open findings of  noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.  2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order  11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of  1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and all regulations promulgated under   such statutes and authorities (including, but not limited to, 24 CFR  part 100), or outstanding violations of the regulatory agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with housing standards. No incentives under  Sec. 248.153 may be provided, other than to qualified purchasers under  Sec. Sec. 248.157 and 245.161, and no distributions may be taken by the  owner or purchaser, until the Commissioner determines that the project  meets the housing standards set forth in Sec. 248.147, except that  incentives designed to correct deficiencies in the project may be  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Implementation. Any agreement to maintain the low income  affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the project  may be made through execution of a new regulatory agreement,  modifications to the existing regulatory agreement or mortgage, or in  the case of prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of  mortgage insurance, a recorded instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the case of any plans of action involving incentives the  owner must agree to comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive  Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act  of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitiation Act of  1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (including the Department's Accessibility  Guidelines (24 CFR chapter I, subchapter A, appendix II) and all  regulations issued pursuant to these authorities.
