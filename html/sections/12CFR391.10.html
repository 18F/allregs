                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. This subpart and the Guidelines in appendices A and B to this subpart are issued by the FDIC under section 39 (section 39) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831p-1) as added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991)), and as amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992)), and as amended by section 318 of the Community Development Banking Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994)). Appendix B to this subpart is further issued under sections 501(b) and 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose.

Pursuant to section 39, a State savings association may be required to submit a compliance plan if it is not in compliance with a safety and soundness standard established by guideline under section 39(a) or (b). An enforceable order under section 8 of the FDI Act may be issued if, after being notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard prescribed under section 39, the State savings association fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan. This subpart</p><p class="depth2">establishes procedures for submissionand review of safety and soundness compliance plans and for issuance and review of orders pursuant to section 39.

Neither section 39 of the FDI Act nor this subpart in any way limits the authority of the FDIC under any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 39 and this subpart may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the FDIC.</p>
