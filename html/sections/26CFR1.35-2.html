Section 36B allows a refundable premium tax credit  for taxable years ending after December 31, 2013. The definitions in  this section apply to this section and Sec. Sec.  1.36B-2 through 1.36B- 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Affordable Care Act. The term Affordable Care Act refers to the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148 (124  Stat. 119 (2010)), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  of 2010, Public Law 111-152 (124 Stat. 1029 (2010)), as amended by the  Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, Public Law 111-309 (124  Stat. 3285 (2010)), the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and  Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011, Public Law 112-9  (125 Stat. 36 (2011)), the Department of Defense and Full-Year  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, Public Law 112-10 (125 Stat. 38  (2011)), and the 3% Withholding Repeal and Job Creation Act, Public Law  112-56 (125 Stat. 711 (2011)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified health plan. The term qualified health plan has the  same meaning as in section 1301(a) of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C.  18021(a)) but does not include a catastrophic plan described in section  1302(e) of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Family and family size. A taxpayer's family means the  individuals for whom a taxpayer properly claims a deduction for a  personal exemption under section 151 for the taxable year. Family size  means the number of individuals in the family. Family and family size  may include individuals who are not subject to or are exempt from the  penalty under section 5000A for failing to maintain minimum essential  coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Household income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Household income means the sum  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate modified adjusted gross income of all other  individuals who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Are included in the taxpayer's family under paragraph (d) of  this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Are required to file a return of tax imposed by section 1 for  the taxable year (determined without regard to the exception under  section (1)(g)(7) to the requirement to file a return).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Modified adjusted gross income. Modified adjusted gross income  means adjusted gross income (within the meaning of section 62) increased  by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts excluded from gross income under section 911;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tax-exempt interest the taxpayer receives or accrues during the  taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Social security benefits (within the meaning of section 86(d))  not included in gross income under section 86.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Dependent. Dependent has the same meaning as in section 152.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Lawfully present. Lawfully present has the same meaning as in 45  CFR 155.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Federal poverty line. The Federal poverty line means the most  recently published poverty guidelines (updated periodically in the  Federal Register by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the  authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) as of the first day of the regular  enrollment period for coverage by a qualified health plan offered  through an Exchange for a calendar year. Thus, the Federal poverty line  for computing the premium tax credit for a taxable year is the Federal  poverty line in effect on the first day of the initial or annual open  enrollment period preceding that taxable year. See 45 CFR 155.410. If a  taxpayer's primary residence changes during a taxable year from one  state to a state with different Federal poverty guidelines or married  taxpayers reside in separate states with different Federal poverty  guidelines (for example, Alaska or Hawaii and another state), the  Federal poverty line that applies for purposes of section 36B and the  associated regulations is the higher Federal poverty guideline  (resulting in a lower percentage of the Federal poverty line for the  taxpayers' household income and family size).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Advance credit payment. Advance credit payment means an advance  payment of the premium tax credit as provided in section 1412 of the  Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18082).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Exchange. Exchange has the same meaning as in 45 CFR 155.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Self-only coverage. Self-only coverage means health insurance  that covers one individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Family coverage. Family coverage means health insurance that  covers more than one individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Rating area. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section and Sec. Sec.  1.36B- 2 through 1.36B-5 apply for taxable years ending after December 31,  2013.  [T.D. 9590, 77 FR 30385, May 23, 2012]    Sec.  1.36B-2  Eligibility for premium tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An applicable taxpayer (within the meaning of  paragraph (b) of this section) is allowed a premium assistance amount  only for any month that one or more members of the applicable taxpayer's  family (the applicable taxpayer or the applicable taxpayer's spouse or  dependent)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is enrolled in one or more qualified health plans through an  Exchange; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not eligible for minimum essential coverage (within the  meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) other than coverage described  in section 5000A(f)(1)(C) (relating to coverage in the individual  market).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (b), an applicable taxpayer is a taxpayer  whose household income is at least 100 percent but not more than 400  percent of the Federal poverty line for the taxpayer's family size for  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dependents. An individual is not an applicable taxpayer if  another taxpayer may claim a deduction under section 151 for the  individual for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which  the individual's taxable year begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individuals not lawfully present or incarcerated. An individual  who is not lawfully present in the United States or is incarcerated  (other than incarceration pending disposition of charges) is not  eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan through an Exchange.  However, the individual may be an applicable taxpayer if a family member  is eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan. See sections  1312(f)(1)(B) and 1312(f)(3) of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C.  18032(f)(1)(B) and (f)(3)) and Sec.  1.36B-3(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Individuals lawfully present. If a taxpayer's household income  is less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty line for the taxpayer's  family size and the taxpayer or a member of the taxpayer's family is an  alien lawfully present in the United States, the taxpayer is treated as  an applicable taxpayer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lawfully present taxpayer or family member is not eligible  for the Medicaid program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer would be an applicable taxpayer if the taxpayer's  household income for the taxable year was between 100 and 400 percent of  the Federal poverty line for the taxpayer's family size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for taxpayers with household income below 100  percent of the Federal poverty line for the taxable year. A taxpayer  (other than a taxpayer described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section)  whose household income for a taxable year is less than 100 percent of  the Federal poverty line for the taxpayer's family size is treated as an  applicable taxpayer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer or a family member enrolls in a qualified health  plan through an Exchange;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An Exchange estimates at the time of enrollment that the  taxpayer's household income will be between 100 and 400 percent of the  Federal poverty line for the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Advance credit payments are authorized and paid for one or  more months during the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The taxpayer would be an applicable taxpayer if the taxpayer's  household income for the taxable year was between 100 and 400 percent of  the Federal poverty line for the taxpayer's family size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Computation of premium assistance amounts for taxpayers with  household income below 100 percent of the Federal poverty line. If a  taxpayer is treated as an applicable taxpayer under paragraph (b)(5) or  (b)(6) of this section, the taxpayer's actual household income for the  taxable year is used to compute the premium assistance amounts under  Sec.  1.36B-3(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum essential coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Minimum essential  coverage is defined in section 5000A(f) and regulations issued under  that section. As described in section 5000A(f), government-sponsored  programs, eligible employer-sponsored plans, grandfathered health plans,  and certain other health benefits coverage are minimum essential  coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Government-sponsored minimum essential coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  An individual is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage if the individual meets the criteria for coverage under a  government-sponsored program described in section 5000A(f)(1)(A) as of  the first day of the first full month the individual may receive  benefits under the program, subject to the limitation in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The Commissioner may define eligibility for  specific government-sponsored programs further in additional published  guidance, see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligation to complete administrative requirements to obtain  coverage. An individual who meets the criteria for eligibility for  government-sponsored minimum essential coverage must complete the  requirements necessary to receive benefits. An individual who fails by  the last day of the third full calendar month following the event that  establishes eligibility under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to  complete the requirements to obtain government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage (other than a veteran's health care program) is  treated as eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage  as of the first day of the fourth calendar month following the event  that establishes eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for coverage for veterans and other individuals  under chapter 17 or 18 of title 38, U.S.C. An individual is eligible for  minimum essential coverage under a health care program under chapter 17  or 18 of title 38, U.S.C. only if the individual is enrolled in a health  care program under chapter 17 or 18 of title 38, U.S.C. identified as  minimum essential coverage in regulations issued under section 5000A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Retroactive effect of eligibility determination. If an  individual receiving advance credit payments is determined to be  eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage that is  effective retroactively (such as Medicaid), the individual is treated as  eligible for minimum essential coverage under that program no earlier  than the first day of the first calendar month beginning after the  approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Determination of Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program  (CHIP) ineligibility. An individual is treated as not eligible for  Medicaid, CHIP, or a similar program for a period of coverage under a  qualified health plan if, when the individual enrolls in the qualified  health plan, an Exchange determines or considers (within the meaning of  45 CFR 155.302(b)) the individual to be not eligible for Medicaid or  CHIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Delay in coverage effectiveness. On April 10, 2015,  Taxpayer D applies for coverage under a government-sponsored health care  program. D's application is approved on July 12, 2015, but her coverage  is not effective until September 1, 2015. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section, D is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage on September 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Time of eligibility. Taxpayer E turns 65 on June 3, 2015,  and becomes eligible for Medicare. Under section 5000A(f)(1)(A)(i),  Medicare is minimum essential coverage. However, E must enroll in  Medicare to receive benefits. E enrolls in Medicare in September, which  is the last month of E's initial enrollment period. Thus, E may receive  Medicare benefits on December 1, 2015. Because E completed the  requirements necessary to receive Medicare benefits by the last day of  the third full calendar month after the event that establishes E's  eligibility (E turning 65), under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of  this section E is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage on December 1, 2015, the first day of the first full month that  E may receive benefits under the program.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Time of eligibility, individual fails to complete  necessary requirements. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except  that E fails to enroll in the Medicare coverage during E's initial  enrollment period. E is treated as eligible for government-sponsored  minimum essential coverage under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section as  of October 1, 2015, the first day of the fourth month following the  event that establishes E's eligibility (E turning 65).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Retroactive effect of eligibility. In November 2014,  Taxpayer F enrolls in a qualified health plan for 2015 and receives  advance credit payments. F loses her part-time employment and on April  10, 2015 applies for coverage under the Medicaid program. F's  application is approved on May 15, 2015, and her Medicaid coverage is  effective as of April 1, 2015. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this  section, F is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage on June 1, 2015, the first day of the first calendar month  after approval.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Determination of Medicaid ineligibility. In November  2014, Taxpayer G applies through the Exchange to enroll in health  coverage for 2015. The Exchange determines that G is not eligible for  Medicaid and estimates that G's household income will be 140 percent of  the Federal poverty line for G's family size for purposes of determining  advance credit payments. G enrolls in a qualified health plan and begins  receiving advance credit payments. G experiences a reduction in  household income during the year and his household income for 2015 is  130 percent of the Federal poverty line (within the Medicaid income  threshold). However, under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, G is  treated as not eligible for Medicaid for 2015.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Mid-year Medicaid eligibility redetermination. The facts  are the same as in Example 5, except that G returns to the Exchange in  July 2015 and the Exchange determines that G is eligible for Medicaid.  Medicaid approves G for coverage and the Exchange discontinues G's  advance credit payments effective August 1. Under paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)  and (c)(2)(v) of this section, G is treated as not eligible for Medicaid  for the months when G is covered by a qualified health plan. G is  eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage for the  months after G is approved for Medicaid and can receive benefits, August  through December 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  For purposes of section 36B, an employee who may enroll in an eligible  employer-sponsored plan (as defined in section 5000A(f)(2)) and an  individual who may enroll in the plan because of a relationship to the  employee (a related individual) are eligible for minimum essential  coverage under the plan for any month only if the plan is affordable and  provides minimum value. Government-sponsored programs described in  section 5000A(f)(1)(A) are not eligible employer-sponsored plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan year. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), a plan year  is an eligible employer-sponsored plan's regular 12-month coverage  period (or the remainder of a 12-month coverage period for a new  employee or an individual who enrolls during a special enrollment  period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligibility for months during a plan year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Failure to  enroll in plan. An employee or related individual may be eligible for  minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for  a month during a plan year if the employee or related individual could  have enrolled in the plan for that month during an open or special  enrollment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Waiting periods. An employee or related individual is not  eligible for minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer- sponsored plan during a required waiting period before the coverage  becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(3)(iii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer B is an employee of Employer X. X offers its  employees a health insurance plan that has a plan year (within the  meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section) from October 1 through  September 30. Employees may enroll during an open season from August 1  to September 15. B does not enroll in X's plan for the plan year October  1, 2014, to September 30, 2015. In November 2014, B enrolls in a  qualified health plan through an Exchange for calendar year 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B could have enrolled in X's plan during the August 1 to  September 15 enrollment period. Therefore, unless X's plan is not  affordable for B or does not provide minimum value, B is eligible for  minimum essential coverage under X's plan for the months that B is  enrolled in the qualified health plan during X's plan year (January  through September 2015).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Continuation coverage. An individual who may enroll in  continuation coverage required under Federal law or a State law that  provides comparable continuation coverage is eligible for minimum  essential coverage only for months that the individual is enrolled in  the coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Affordable coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Affordability for  employee. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3) of this  section, an eligible employer-sponsored plan is affordable for an  employee if the portion of the annual premium the employee must pay,  whether by salary reduction   or otherwise (required contribution), for self-only coverage does not  exceed the required contribution percentage (as defined in paragraph  (c)(3)(v)(C) of this section) of the applicable taxpayer's household  income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affordability for related individual. Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3) of this section, an eligible employer- sponsored plan is affordable for a related individual if the portion of  the annual premium the employee must pay for self-only coverage does not  exceed the required contribution percentage, as described in paragraph  (c)(3)(v)(A)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> does not  apply for an individual who, with reckless disregard for the facts,  provides incorrect information to an Exchange concerning the portion of  the annual premium for coverage for the employee or related individual  under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wellness incentives and employer contributions to health  reimbursement arrangements. The Commissioner may provide rules in  published guidance, see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, for  determining how wellness incentives and amounts made available under a  health reimbursement arrangement are treated in determining the  affordability of eligible employer-sponsored coverage under this  paragraph (c)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(3)(v). Unless stated otherwise, in each example the  taxpayer is single and has no dependents, the employer's plan is an  eligible employer-sponsored plan and provides minimum value, the  employee is not eligible for other minimum essential coverage, and the  taxpayer, related individual, and employer-sponsored plan have a  calendar taxable year:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Basic determination of affordability. In 2014 Taxpayer C  has household income of $47,000. C is an employee of Employer X, which  offers its employees a health insurance plan that requires C to  contribute $3,450 for self-only coverage for 2014 (7.3 percent of C's  household income). Because C's required contribution for self-only  coverage does not exceed 9.5 percent of household income, under  paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(1) of this section, X's plan is affordable for C,  and C is eligible for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2014.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Basic determination of affordability for a related  individual. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that C is  married to J and X's plan requires C to contribute $5,300 for coverage  for C and J for 2014 (11.3 percent of C's household income). Because C's  required contribution for self-only coverage ($3,450) does not exceed  9.5 percent of household income, under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(2) of this  section, X's plan is affordable for C and J, and C and J are eligible  for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Taxpayer D is an employee of Employer X. In November 2013 the Exchange  for D's rating area projects that D's 2014 household income will be  $37,000. It also verifies that D's required contribution for self-only  coverage under X's health insurance plan will be $3,700 (10 percent of  household income). Consequently, the Exchange determines that X's plan  is unaffordable. D enrolls in a qualified health plan and not in X's  plan. In December 2014, X pays D a $2,500 bonus. Thus, D's actual 2014  household income is $39,500 and D's required contribution for coverage  under X's plan is 9.4 percent of D's household income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on D's actual 2014 household income, D's required  contribution does not exceed 9.5 percent of household income and X's  health plan is affordable for D. However, when D enrolled in a qualified  health plan for 2014, the Exchange determined that X's plan was not  affordable for D for 2014. Consequently, under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3)  of this section, X's plan is not affordable for D and D is not eligible  for minimum essential coverage under X's plan for 2014.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Determination of unaffordability for plan year. The facts  are the same as in Example 3, except that X's employee health insurance  plan year is September 1 to August 31. The Exchange for D's rating area  determines in August 2014 that X's plan is unaffordable for D based on  D's projected household income for 2014. D enrolls in a qualified health  plan as of September 1, 2014. Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3) of this  section, X's plan is not affordable for D and D is not eligible for  minimum essential coverage under X's plan for the coverage months  September to December 2014 and January through August 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3,  except the Exchange redetermines D's eligibility for advance credit  payments for 2015. D does not affirmatively provide the Exchange with  current information regarding affordability and the Exchange determines  that D's coverage is not affordable for 2015 and approves advance credit  payments based on information from the previous enrollment period. In  2015, D's required contribution for coverage under X's plan is 9.4  percent of D's household income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because D does not respond to the Exchange notification and the  Exchange makes an affordability determination based on information from  an earlier year, the employee safe harbor in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3)  of this section does not apply. D's required contribution for 2015 does  not exceed 9.5 percent of D's household income. Thus, X's plan is  affordable for D for 2015 and D is eligible for minimum essential  coverage for all months in 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer E is an employee of Employer X  beginning in May 2015. X's employee health insurance plan year is  September 1 to August 31. E's required contribution for self-only  coverage for May through August is $150 per month ($1,800 for the full  plan year). The Exchange for E's rating area projects E's household  income for purposes of eligibility for advance credit payments as  $18,000. E's actual household income for the 2015 taxable year is  $20,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this section, whether coverage  under X's plan is affordable for E is determined for the remainder of  X's plan year (May through August). E's required contribution for a full  plan year ($1,800) exceeds 9.5 percent of E's household income (1,800/ 18,000 = 10 percent). Therefore, the Exchange determines that X's  coverage is unaffordable for May through August. Although E's actual  household income for 2015 is $20,000 (and E's required contribution of  $1,800 does not exceed 9.5 percent of E's household income), under  paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(3) of this section, X's plan is unaffordable for  E for the part of the plan year May through August 2015. Consequently, E  is not eligible for minimum essential coverage under X's plan for the  period May through August 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer F is an employee of Employer X. X's  employee health insurance plan year is September 1 to August 31. F's  required contribution for self-only coverage for the period September  2014 through August 2015 is $150 per month or $1,800 for the plan year.  F does not enroll in X's plan during X's open season but enrolls in a  qualified health plan for September through December 2014. F does not  request advance credit payments and does not ask the Exchange for his  rating area to determine whether X's coverage is affordable for F. F's  household income in 2014 is $18,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because F is a calendar year taxpayer and Employer X's plan is  not a calendar year plan, F must determine the affordability of X's  coverage for the part-year period in 2014 (September-December) under  paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this section. F determines the affordability  of X's plan for the September through December 2014 period by comparing  the annual premiums ($1,800) to F's 2014 household income. F's required  contribution of $1,800 is 10 percent of F's 2014 household income.  Because F's required contribution exceeds 9.5 percent of F's 2014  household income, X's plan is not affordable for F for the part-year  period September through December 2014 and F is not eligible for minimum  essential coverage under X's plan for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> F enrolls in Exchange coverage for 2015 and does not ask the  Exchange to approve   advance credit payments or determine whether X's coverage is affordable.  F's 2015 household income is $20,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> F must determine if X's plan is affordable for the part-year  period January 2015 through August 2015. F's annual required  contribution ($1,800) is 9 percent of F's 2015 household income. Because  F's required contribution does not exceed 9.5 percent of F's 2015  household income, X's plan is affordable for F for the part-year period  January through August 2015 and F is eligible for minimum essential  coverage for that period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Coverage unaffordable at year end. Taxpayer G is employed  by Employer X. In November 2014, the Exchange for G's rating area  determines that G is eligible for affordable employer-sponsored coverage  for 2015. G nonetheless enrolls in a qualified health plan for 2015 but  does not receive advance credit payments. G's 2015 household income is  less than expected and G's required contribution for employer-sponsored  coverage for 2015 exceeds 9.5 percent of G's actual 2015 household  income. Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)(1) of this section, G is not  eligible for minimum essential coverage under X's plan for 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Minimum value. An eligible employer-sponsored plan provides  minimum value only if the plan's share of the total allowed costs of  benefits provided to the employee under the plan (as determined under  guidance issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under  section 1302(d)(2) of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(d)(2)))  is at least 60 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Enrollment in eligible employer-sponsored plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general.

An employee or related individual is  treated as not enrolled in an eligible employer-sponsored plan for a  month in a plan year or other period for which the employee or related  individual is automatically enrolled if the employee or related  individual terminates the coverage before the later of the first day of  the second full calendar month of that plan year or other period or the  last day of any permissible opt-out period provided by the employer- sponsored plan or in regulations to be issued by the Department of  Labor, for that plan year or other period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples.

A enrolls in a  qualified health plan. The annual premium for the applicable benchmark  plan is $5,200. A's advance credit payments are $2,952, computed as  follows: benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of  $2,248 (projected household income of $27,925 x .0805) = $2,952.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's household income for 2014 is $33,622, which is 301 percent  of the Federal poverty line for a family of one (applicable percentage  9.5).

Because A's advance credit  payments for 2014 are $2,952 and A's 2014 credit is $2,006, A has excess  advance payments of $946. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, A's  tax liability for 2014 is increased by $946. Because A's household  income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of the Federal poverty  line, if A's excess advance payments exceeded $1,250, under the  limitation of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, A's additional tax  liability would be limited to that amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

Consequently, A's premium tax  credit for 2014 is $1,062 ($5,200 benchmark plan premium less  contribution amount of $4,138 (household income of $43,560 x .095)). A's  advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,952; therefore, A has excess  advance payments of $1,890.

Consequently, A's premium tax credit for 2014 is $3,793  ($5,200 benchmark plan premium less contribution amount of $1,407  (household income of $22,340 x .063)).

Because F has  only eight coverage months in 2014, F's credit is $1,888 ($2,832/12 x  8). Because F does not discontinue her Exchange coverage until November  1, 2014, F's advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,460 ($246 x 10).
