                                Sec. 108.35  Thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inadequate or improper manufacture, processing, or packing of  thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers may  result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods  that may be injurious to health. The harmful nature of such foods cannot  be adequately determined after these foods have entered into interstate  commerce. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs therefore finds that, in  order to protect the public health, it may be necessary to require any  commercial processor, in any establishment engaged in the manufacture,  processing, or packing of thermally processed low-acid foods in  hermetically sealed containers, to obtain and hold a temporary emergency  permit provided for under section 404 of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic   Act. Such a permit may be required whenever the Commissioner finds,  after investigation, that the commercial processor has failed to fulfill  all the requirements of this section, including registration and the  filing of process information, and the mandatory portions of part 113 of  this chapter. These requirements are intended to ensure safe  manufacture, processing, and packing procedures and to permit the Food  and Drug Administration to verify that these procedures are being  followed. Such failure shall constitute a prima facie basis for the  immediate application of the emergency permit control provisions of  section 404 of the act to that establishment, pursuant to the procedures  established in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The definitions in Sec. 113.3 of this chapter are applicable  when such terms are used in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Registration and process filing--(1) Registration. A commercial  processor when first engaging in the manufacture, processing, or packing  of thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers  in any state, as defined in section 201(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the act, shall, not  later than 10 days after first so engaging, register with the Food and  Drug Administration on Form FDA 2541 (food canning establishment  registration) information including (but not limited to) his name,  principal place of business, the location of each establishment in which  such processing is carried on, the processing method in terms of the  type of processing equipment employed, and a list of the low-acid foods  so processed in each such establishment. These forms are available from  the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-618), Center for Food Safety and  Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or at any Food and Drug Administration  district office. The completed form shall be submitted to the LACF  Registration Coordinator (HFS-618), Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy.,  College Park, MD 20740. Commercial processors presently so engaged shall  register not later than July 13, 1973. Commercial processors duly  registered in accordance with this section shall notify the Food and  Drug Administration not later than 90 days after such commercial  processor ceases or discontinues the manufacture, processing, or packing  of thermally processed foods in any establishment: Provided, That such  notification shall not be required as to the temporary cessation  necessitated by the seasonal character of the particular establishment's  production or caused by temporary conditions including but not limited  to strikes, lockouts, fire, or acts of God.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Process filing. A commercial processor engaged in the thermal  processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers  shall, not later than 60 days after registration and prior to the  packing of a new product, provide the Food and Drug Administration  information as to the scheduled processes including but not limited to  the processing method, type of retort or other thermal processing  equipment employed, minimum initial temperatures, times and temperatures  of processing, sterilizing value (Fo), or other equivalent scientific  evidence of process adequacy, critical control factors affecting heat  penetration, and source and date of the establishment of the process,  for each such low-acid food in each container size: Provided, That the  filing of such information does not constitute approval of the  information by the Food and Drug Administration, and that information  concerning processes and other data so filed shall be regarded as trade  secrets within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905. This  information shall be submitted on the following forms as appropriate:  Form FDA 2541a (food canning establishment process filing for all  methods except aseptic), or Form FDA 2541c (food canning establishment  process filing for aseptic systems). These forms are available from the  LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-618), Center for Food Safety and  Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or at any Food and Drug Administration  district office. The completed form(s) shall be submitted to the LACF  Registration Coordinator (HFS-618), Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition, Food and   Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If all the necessary information is not available for existing  products, the processor shall, at the time the existing information is  provided to the Food and Drug Administration request in writing an  extension of time for submission of such information, specifying what  additional information is to be supplied and the date by which it is to  be submitted. Within 30 working days after receipt of such request the  Food and Drug Administration shall either grant or deny such request in  writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a packer intentionally makes a change in a previously filed  scheduled process by reducing the initial temperature or retort  temperature, reducing the time of processing, or changing the product  formulation, the container, or any other condition basic to the adequacy  of scheduled process, he shall prior to using such changed process  obtain substantiation by qualified scientific authority as to its  adequacy. Such substantiation may be obtained by telephone, telegram, or  other media, but must be promptly recorded, verified in writing by the  authority, and contained in the packer's files for review by the Food  and Drug Administration. Within 30 days after first use, the packer  shall submit to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS- 617), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy., College  Park, MD 20740 a complete description of the modifications made and  utilized, together with a copy of his file record showing prior  substantiation by a qualified scientific authority as to the safety of  the changed process. Any intentional change of a previously filed  scheduled process or modification thereof in which the change consists  solely of a higher initial temperature, a higher retort temperature, or  a longer processing time, shall not be considered a change subject to  this paragraph, but if that modification is thereafter to be regularly  scheduled, the modified process shall be promptly filed as a scheduled  process, accompanied by full information on the specified forms as  provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Many packers employ an ``operating'' process in which retort  operators are instructed to use retort temperatures and/or processing  times slightly in excess of those specified in the scheduled process as  a safety factor to compensate for minor fluctuations in temperature or  time to assure that the minimum times and temperatures in the scheduled  process are always met. This would not constitute a modification of the  scheduled process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Process adherence and information. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A commercial processor  engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in  hermetically sealed containers in any registered establishment shall  process each low-acid food in each container size in conformity with at  least the scheduled processes and modifications filed pursuant to  paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Process information availability: When requested by the Food  and Drug Administration in writing, a commercial processor engaged in  thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed  containers shall provide the Food and Drug Administration with any  information concerning processes and procedures which is deemed  necessary by the Food and Drug Administration to determine the adequacy  of the process: Provided, That the furnishing of such information does  not constitute approval of the information by the Food and Drug  Administration, and that the information concerning processes and other  data so furnished shall be regarded as trade secrets within the meaning  of 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low- acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall promptly  report to the Food and Drug Administration any instance of spoilage or  process deviation the nature of which indicates potential health  significance where any lot of such food has in whole or in part entered  distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A commercial processor engaged in thermal processing of low-acid  foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall promptly report  to the Food and Drug Administration any instance wherein any lot of such  food, which may be injurious to health by   reason of contamination with microorganisms, has in whole or in part  entered distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low- acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall have  prepared and in his files a current procedure which he will use for  products under his control and which he will ask his distributor to  follow, including plans for effecting recalls of any product that may be  injurious to health; for identifying, collecting, warehousing, and  controlling the product; for determining the effectiveness of such  recall; for notifying the Food and Drug Administration of any such  recall; and for implementing such recall program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All operators of retorts, thermal processing systems, aseptic  processing and packaging systems, or other thermal processing systems,  and container closure inspectors shall be under the operating  supervision of a person who has attended a school approved by the  Commissioner for giving instruction in retort operations, aseptic  processing and packaging systems operations or other thermal processing  systems operations, and container closure inspections, and has  satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of instruction: Provided,  That this requirement shall not apply in the State of California as  listed in paragraph (j) of this section. The Commissioner will not  withhold approval of any school qualified to give such instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low- acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers shall prepare,  review, and retain at the processing plant for a period of not less than  one year, and at the processing plant or other reasonably accessible  location for an additional two years, all records of processing,  deviations in processing, container closure inspections, and other  records specified in part 113 of this chapter. If during the first year  of the three-year record retention period the processing plant is closed  for a prolonged period between seasonal packs, the records may be  transferred to some other reasonably accessible location at the end of  the seasonal pack. Upon written demand during the course of a factory  inspection pursuant to section 704 of the act by a duly authorized  employee of the Food and Drug Administration, a commercial processor  shall permit the inspection and copying by such employee of these  records to verify the adequacy of processing, the integrity of container  closures, and the coding of the products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> This section shall not apply to the commercial processing of any  food processed under the continuous inspection of the meat and poultry  inspection program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of  the Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (34  Stat. 1256, as amended by 81 Stat. 584 (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)) and the  Poultry Products Inspection Act (71 Stat. 441, as amended by 82 Stat.  791 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compliance with State regulations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wherever the Commissioner  finds that any State regulates the commercial thermal processing of low- acid foods in accordance with effective regulations specifying at least  the requirements of part 113 of this chapter, he shall issue a notice  stating that compliance with such State regulations shall constitute  compliance with part 113 of this chapter. However, the provisions of  this section shall remain applicable to the commercial processing of  low-acid foods in any such State, except that, either the State through  its regulatory agency or each processor of low-acid foods in such State  shall file with the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition the  registration information and the processing information prescribed in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commissioner finds that the regulations adopted by the State  of California under the laws relating to cannery inspections governing  thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed  containers satisfy the requirements of part 113 of this chapter.  Accordingly, processors, who under the laws relating to cannery  inspections are licensed by the State of California and who comply with  such state regulations, shall be deemed to comply with the requirements  of part 113 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Imports. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section shall apply to any foreign commercial  processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged  in hermetically sealed containers and offering such foods for import  into the United States except that, in lieu of providing for the  issuance of an emergency permit under paragraph (a) of this section, the  Commissioner will request the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse  admission into the United States, pursuant to section 801 of the act, of  any such low-acid foods which the Commissioner determines, after  investigation, may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of  processed foods that may be injurious to health as set forth in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any such food refused admission shall not be admitted until such  time as the Commissioner may determine that the commercial processor  offering the food for import is in compliance with the requirements and  conditions of this section and that such food is not injurious to  health. For the purpose of making such determination, the Commissioner  reserves the right for a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug  Administration to inspect the commercial processor's manufacturing,  processing, and packing facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The following data and information submitted to the Food and  Drug Administration pursuant to this section are not available for  public disclosure unless they have been previously disclosed to the  public as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter or they relate to a  product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they no longer  represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial  information as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and  information, except that any compilation of such data and information  aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or  information which is not available for public disclosure under this  provision is available for public disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
