                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative  Conference of the United States (``ACUS'' or ``the agency'') follows in  processing requests for disclosure of records under the Freedom of  Information Act (``FOIA'' or ``the Act''), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and  in meeting its responsibilities under the Act. Note that electronic  records are treated as records for the purposes of the FOIA. These rules  should be read together with the text of the FOIA itself, which provides  additional information about access to records maintained by the agency.  They also may be read in conjunction with the agency's ``Freedom of  Information Act Reference Guide,'' which provides basic information  about use of the Act in relation to the agency's records. Requests made  by individuals for access to records about themselves under the Privacy  Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a (2006 & Supp. II 2008), which are processed  under subpart B of this part, are also processed under this subpart. The  agency will automatically process the request under both provisions in  order to provide the maximum possible records to the requester.  Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular agency  activity (for example, press releases or recommendations adopted by the  agency pursuant to the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C. 591 et  seq.) may be provided to the public without following this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As a matter of policy, ACUS makes discretionary disclosures of  records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever it  is determined that disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest  protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right  enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agency has designated its General Counsel as its Chief FOIA  Officer, who has agency-wide responsibility   for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA and these  implementing regulations. The General Counsel has designated the  agency's Deputy General Counsel as its FOIA Public Liaison.</p>
