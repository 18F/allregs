                            <p class="depth0">An applicant or participant must be at least 51 percent unconditionally and directly owned by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ownership must be direct. Ownership by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans must be direct ownership. An applicant or participant owned principally by another business entity or by a trust (including employee stock ownership plans [ESOP]) that is in turn owned by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans does not meet this requirement. However, ownership by a trust, such as a living trust, may be treated as the functional equivalent of ownership by a veteran or service-disabled veteran where the trust is revocable, and the veteran or service-disabled veteran is the grantor, a trustee, and the sole current beneficiary of the trust. For employee stock ownership plans where 5 or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of the corporation, the employee plan will be determined to be ``excluded stock'' and eligible parties must control 51 percent or more of the combined voting power of the corporation. For employee stock ownership plans where greater than 5 persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own 50 percent or more of the total stock, eligible parties must control 51 percent or more of the combined voting power of the corporation, including the ESOP stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ownership must be unconditional. Ownership by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans must be unconditional ownership. Ownership must not be subject to conditions precedent, conditions subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on assignments of voting rights, or other arrangements causing or potentially causing ownership benefits to go to another (other than after death or incapacity). The pledge or encumbrance of stock or other ownership interest as collateral, including seller-financed transactions, does not affect the unconditional nature of ownership

if the terms follow normal commercial practices and the owner retains control absent violations of the terms. In particular, CVE will evaluate ownership according to the following criteria for specific types of small business concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ownership of a partnership. In the case of a concern that is a partnership, at least 51 percent of every class of partnership interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans. The ownership must be reflected in the concern's partnership agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership of a limited liability company. In the case of a concern that is a limited liability company, at least 51 percent of each class of member interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ownership of a corporation. In the case of a concern that is a corporation, at least 51 percent of each class of voting stock outstanding and 51 percent of the aggregate of all stock outstanding must be unconditionally owned by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stock options' effect on ownership. In determining unconditional ownership, CVE will disregard any unexercised stock options or similar agreements held by veterans or service-disabled veterans. However, any unexercised stock options or similar agreements (including rights to convert non-voting stock or debentures into voting stock) held by non-veterans will be treated as exercised, except for any ownership interests that are held by investment companies licensed under part 107 of title 13, Code of Federal Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Profits and distributions. One or more veterans or service-disabled veterans must be entitled to receive:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 51 percent of the annual distribution of profits paid to the owners of a corporate, partnership, or LLC applicant or participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 51 percent of the net profits earned by a joint venture in which the applicant or participant is the lead concern;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 100 percent of the value of each share of stock owned by them in the event that the stock is sold; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At least 51 percent of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the unencumbered value of each share of stock owned in the event of dissolution of the corporation, partnership, or LLC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An eligible individual's ability to share in the profits of the concern should be commensurate with the extent of his/her ownership interest in that concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Change of ownership. (1) A participant may remain eligible after a change in its ownership or business structure, so long as one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans own and control it after the change and the participant files a new application identifying the new veteran owners or their new business interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A participant may remain eligible after a change in its ownership or business structure, so long as one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans own and control it after the change and the participant files a new application identifying the new veteran owners or their new business interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any participant that is performing contracts and desires to substitute one veteran owner for another shall submit a proposed novation agreement and supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.12 to the contracting officer prior to the substitution or change of ownership for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the transfer results from the death or incapacity due to a serious, long-term illness or injury of an eligible principal, prior approval is not required, but the concern must file a new application with contracting officer and CVE within 60 days of the change. Existing contracts may be performed to the end of the instant term. However, no options may be exercised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Continued eligibility of the participant with new ownership and the award of any new contracts require that CVE verify all eligibility requirements are met by the concern and the new owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Community property laws given effect. In determining ownership interests when an owner resides in any of the community property States or territories of the United States, CVE considers applicable State community property laws. If only one spouse claims veteran status, that spouse's ownership interest will be considered unconditionally held only to the extent it is vested by the community property laws.
