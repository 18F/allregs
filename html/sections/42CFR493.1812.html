                            <p class="depth0">If a laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CMS requires the laboratory to take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and may impose one or more alternative sanctions to help bring the laboratory into compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the findings of a revisit indicate that a laboratory has not eliminated the jeopardy, CMS suspends or limits the laboratory's CLIA certificate no earlier than 5 days after the date of notice of suspension or limitation. CMS may later revoke the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition, if CMS has reason to believe that the continuation of any activity by any laboratory (either the entire laboratory operation or any specialty or subspecialty of testing) would constitute a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may bring suit and seek a temporary injunction or restraining order against continuation of that activity by the laboratory, regardless of the type of CLIA certificate the laboratory has and of whether it is State-exempt.</p>
