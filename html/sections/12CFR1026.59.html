                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule--(1) Evaluation of increased rate. If a card issuer increases an annual percentage rate that applies to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, based on the credit risk of the consumer, market conditions, or other factors, or increased such a rate on or after January 1, 2009, and 45 days' advance notice of the rate increase is required pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2) or (g), the card issuer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evaluate the factors described in paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on its review of such factors, reduce the annual percentage rate

applicable to the consumer's account, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate reductions--(i) Timing. If a card issuer is required to reduce the rate applicable to an account pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the card issuer must reduce the rate not later than 45 days after completion of the evaluation described in paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicability of rate reduction. Any reduction in an annual percentage rate required pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any outstanding balances to which the increased rate described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section has been applied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> New transactions that occur after the effective date of the rate reduction that would otherwise have been subject to the increased rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Policies and procedures. A card issuer must have reasonable written policies and procedures in place to conduct the review described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing. A card issuer that is subject to paragraph (a) of this section must conduct the review described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section not less frequently than once every six months after the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Factors--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a card issuer must review either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The factors on which the increase in an annual percentage rate was originally based; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The factors that the card issuer currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010. For rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010, an issuer must consider the factors described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) when conducting the first two reviews required under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the rate increase subject to paragraph (a) of this section was based solely upon factors specific to the consumer, such as a decline in the consumer's credit risk, the consumer's delinquency or default, or a violation of the terms of the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rate increases due to delinquency. If an issuer increases a rate applicable to a consumer's account pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) based on the card issuer not receiving the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date, the issuer is not required to perform the review described in paragraph (a) of this section prior to the sixth payment due date after the effective date of the increase. However, if the annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's account is not reduced pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii), the card issuer must perform the review described in paragraph (a) of this section. The first such review must occur no later than six months after the sixth payment due following the effective date of the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Termination of obligation to review factors. The obligation to review factors described in paragraph (a) and (d) of this section ceases to apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the issuer reduces the annual percentage rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan to the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase, or, if the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase was a variable rate, to a variable rate determined by the same formula (index and margin) that was used to calculate the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the issuer reduces the annual percentage rate to a rate that is lower than the rate described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Acquired accounts--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to credit card accounts that have been acquired by the card issuer from another card issuer. A card issuer that complies with this section by reviewing the factors described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) must review the factors considered by the card issuer from which it acquired the accounts in connection with the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review of acquired portfolio. If, not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, a card issuer reviews all of the credit card accounts it

acquires in accordance with the factors that it currently considers in determining the rates applicable to its similar new credit card accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iii), the card issuer is required to conduct reviews described in paragraph (a) of this section only for rate increases that are imposed as a result of its review under this paragraph. See Sec. 1026.9 and 1026.55 for additional requirements regarding rate increases on acquired accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the card issuer is not required to conduct reviews in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section for any rate increases made prior to the card issuer's acquisition of such accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If as a result of the card issuer's review, an account is subject to, or continues to be subject to, an increased rate as a penalty, or due to the consumer's delinquency or default, the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions--(1) Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception. The requirements of this section do not apply to increases in an annual percentage rate that was previously decreased pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527, provided that such a rate increase is made in accordance with Sec. 1026.55(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Charged off accounts. The requirements of this section do not apply to accounts that the card issuer has charged off in accordance with loan-loss provisions.</p>
