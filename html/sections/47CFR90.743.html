                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All licensees seeking renewal of their authorizations at the end of their

license term must file a renewal application in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.949 of this chapter. Licensees must demonstrate, in their application, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They have provided ``substantial'' service during their past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined in this rule as service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service that just might minimally warrant renewal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They have substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of its current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an EA, Regional, or nationwide licensee, an explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable of the construction of new stations to meet changes in demand for service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of its investments in its system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Phase I non-nationwide licensees have license terms of 10 years, and therefore must meet these requirements 10 years from the date of initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy. Phase I nationwide licensees and all Phase II licensees have license terms of 10 years, and therefore must meet these requirements 10 years from the date of initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy.
