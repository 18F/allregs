Public safety licensees authorized to operate in the 758-775 MHz and 788-805 MHz bands may notify any licensee authorized to operate in the 746-757 MHz or 776-787 MHz bands that they wish to receive prior notification of the activation or modification of the licensee's base or fixed stations in their area. Thereafter, the 746-757 MHz or 776-787 MHz band licensee must provide the following information to the public safety licensee at least 10 business days before a new base or fixed station is activated or an existing base or fixed station is modified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective radiated power;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Antenna height; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Channels available for use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Purpose of prior notification. The prior coordination of base or fixed stations is for informational purposes only. Public safety licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed base or fixed station or to unilaterally require

changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allow a public safety licensee to advise the 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee whether it believes a proposed base or fixed station will generate unacceptable interference;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permit 746-757 and 776-787 MHz band licensees to make voluntary changes in base or fixed station parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the base or fixed station is activated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Public Safety Information Exchange. (1) Upon request by a 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee, public safety licensees authorized to operate radio systems in the 758-775 and 788-805 MHz bands shall provide the operating parameters of their radio system to the 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public safety licensees who perform the information exchange described in this section must notify the appropriate 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensees prior to any technical changes to their radio system.
