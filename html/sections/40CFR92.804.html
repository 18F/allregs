                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise specified, any person may apply for the exemptions allowed by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine that qualifies for a temporary exemption under this paragraph may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for a temporary exemption from the Administrator shall contain the identification required in Sec. 92.803 and information that demonstrates that the locomotives and or locomotive engines qualify for an exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond and/or exportation of the locomotive or locomotive engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exemption for repairs or alterations. Upon written approval by EPA, a person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The locomotive or locomotive engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing exemption. A nonconforming test locomotive or locomotive engine may be conditionally imported by a person subject to the requirements of Sec. 92.905. A test locomotive or locomotive engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer, and subsequently granted by EPA, concerning the locomotive or locomotive engine in accordance with Sec. 92.905 for a subsequent one-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Display exemptions. (i) A nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported under bond subject to the requirements of Sec. 92.906(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported under bond subject to the requirements of Sec. 92.906(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A display locomotive or locomotive engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of a locomotive or locomotive engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display locomotive or locomotive engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National security exemption. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, a locomotive or locomotive engine may be permanently imported into the United States under the national security exemption found at Sec. 92.908, if prior written approval for such permanent importation is obtained from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in Sec. 92.803 and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An application for exemption provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be mailed to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs

Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Imports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Incidental use exemption. Locomotives that are operated primarily outside of the United States, and that enter the United States temporarily from Canada or Mexico are exempt from the requirements and prohibitions of this part without application, provided that the operation within the United States is not extensive and is incidental to their primary operation.</p>
