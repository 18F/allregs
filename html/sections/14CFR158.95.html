It will not enter into any lease or use agreement with any air carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in part with revenue derived from a passenger facility charge if such agreement for such facility contains a carryover provision regarding a renewal option which, upon expiration of the original lease, would operate to automatically extend the term of such agreement with such carrier in preference to any potentially competing air carrier or foreign air carrier seeking to negotiate a lease or use agreement for such facilities.</p><p class="depth0">7. Competitive access. It agrees that any lease or use agreements between the public agency and any air carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in part with revenue derived from a passenger facility charge will contain a provision that permits the public agency to terminate the lease or use agreement if--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The air carrier or foreign air carrier has an exclusive lease or use agreement for existing facilities at such airport; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any portion of its existing exclusive use facilities is not fully utilized and is not made available for use by potentially competing air carriers or foreign air carriers.</p><p class="depth0">8.

Standards and specifications. It will carry out the project in accordance with FAA airport design, construction and equipment standards and specifications contained

in advisory circulars current on the date of project approval.</p><p class="depth2">10. Recordkeeping and Audit.
