                            <p class="depth0">Federal funding is available for reasonable and necessary  identifiable administrative costs of providing assistance and services  under this part only for those assistance and service programs set forth  in Sec. Sec. 400.203 through 400.205 for which Federal funding is  currently made available under the refugee program. A State may claim  only those costs that are determined to be reasonable and allowable as  defined by the Administration for Children and Families. Such costs may  include reasonable and necessary administrative costs incurred by local  resettlement agencies in providing assistance and services under a  public/private RCA program. Administrative costs may be   included in a State's claims against its quarterly grants for the  purposes set forth in Sec. Sec. 400.203 through 400.205 of this part.
