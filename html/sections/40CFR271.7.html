This statement shall include citations to the specific  statutes, administrative regulations and, where appropriate, judicial  decisions which demonstrate adequate authority. State statutes and  regulations cited by the State Attorney General or independent legal  counsel shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State statutes and  regulations at the   time the statement is signed and shall be fully effective by the time  the program is approved. To qualify as ``independent legal counsel'' the  attorney signing the statement required by this section must have full  authority to independently represent the State agency in court on all  matters pertaining to the State program.</p><p class="depth2">Note: EPA will supply States with an Attorney General's statement  format on request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a State seeks authority over activities on Indian lands,  the statement shall contain an appropriate analysis of the State's  authority.</p>
