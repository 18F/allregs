                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Administrative Law Judge as soon as practicable  after the parties have completed their submissions of proof, or after  the conclusion of an oral hearing if one is held, shall render the  initial decision, which he shall forthwith file with the Proceedings  Clerk, and a copy of which shall be served immediately by the  Proceedings Clerk upon each of the parties. The Proceedings Clerk shall  also serve a notice, to accompany the initial decision, of the effect of  a party's failure timely to appeal to the Commission the initial  decision, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and the  effect of a failure of a party who has been ordered to pay a reparation  award timely to file the documents required by Sec. 12.407(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of initial decision. In the initial decision the  Administrative Law Judge shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include a brief statement of his findings as to the facts, with  references to those portions of the record which support his findings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make a determination whether or not the respondent has violated  any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, or rule, regulation or  order thereunder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make a determination whether the complainant is liable to any  respondent who has made a counterclaim in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine the amount of damages, if any, that the complainant  has sustained as a result of respondent's violations, the amount of  punitive damages if warranted, and the amount, if any, for which  complainant is liable   to a respondent based on a counterclaim; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include an order directing either the respondent or the  complainant, depending upon whose liability is greater, to pay an amount  based on the difference in the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph  (b)(4) of this section, on or before a date fixed in the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and 12.315 of these rules, the Administrative Law Judge may, in  the initial decision, award costs (including the cost of instituting the  proceeding and, if appropriate, reasonable attorney's fees) and, if  warranted as a matter of law under the cirumstances of the particular  case, prejudgment interest, to the party in whose favor a judgment is  entered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of initial decision. The initial decision and order shall  become the final decision and order of the Commission, without further  order by the Commission, thirty (30) days after service thereof, except  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The initial decision shall not become the final decision as to a  party who shall have timely filed and perfected an appeal thereof to the  Commission, in accordance with Sec. 12.401 of these rules; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The initial decision shall not become final as to any party to  the proceeding if, within thirty (30) days after service of the initial  decision, the Commission itself shall have placed the case on its own  docket for review or stayed the effective date of the initial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of failure to file and perfect an appeal to the  Commission. Unless the Commission takes review of an initial decision on  its own motion, the timely filing and perfection of an appeal to the  Commission of the initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to  appellate judicial review of a final decision and order entered pursuant  to these rules.
