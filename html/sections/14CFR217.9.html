                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A waiver from any reporting requirement contained in Schedule T- 100(f) may be granted by the Department upon its own initiative, or upon  the submission of a written request of the air carrier to the Director,  Office of Airline Information, when such a waiver is in the public  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each request for waiver must demonstrate that: Existing  peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the  prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative  procedure or technique will result in substantially equivalent or more  accurate portrayal of the operations reported; and the application of  such alternative procedure will not adversely affect the uniformity in  reporting applicable to all air carriers.
