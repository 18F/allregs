                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The additional estate tax as defined in section 2011(d) does not apply to the transfer of the taxable estate of a citizen or resident of the United States dying during an induction period as defined in section 112(c)(5) (see paragraph (b) of this section) and while in active service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, if the decedent--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was killed in action while serving in a combat zone, as determined under section 112(c) (2) and (3) (see paragraph (c) of this section), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Died as a result of wounds, disease, or injury suffered while serving in such a combat zone and while in line of duty, by reason of a hazard to which he was subject as an incident of such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 112(c)(5) defines the term ``induction period'' as meaning any period during which individuals are liable for induction, for reasons other than

prior deferment, for training and service in the Armed Forces of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 112(c) (2) and (3) provides that service is performed in a combat zone only--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it is performed in an area which the President of the United States has designated by Executive order for purposes of section 112(c) as an area in which the Armed Forces of the United States are, or have, engaged in combat, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it is performed on or after the date designated by the President by Executive order as the date of the commencing of combatant activities in such zone and on or before the date designated by the President by Executive order as the date of termination of combatant activities in such zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the official record of the branch of the Armed Forces of which the decedent was a member at the time of his death states that the decedent was killed in action while serving in a combat zone, or that death resulted from wounds or injuries received or disease contracted while in line of duty in a combat zone, this fact shall, in the absence of evidence establishing to the contrary, be presumed to be established for the purposes of the exemption. Moreover, wounds, injuries or disease suffered while in line of duty will be considered to have been caused by a hazard to which the decedent was subjected as an incident of service as a member of the Armed Forces, unless the hazard which caused the wounds, injuries, or disease was clearly unrelated to such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person was in active service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States if he was at the time of his death actually serving in such forces. A member of the Armed Forces in active service in a combat zone who thereafter becomes a prisoner of war or missing in action, and occupies such status at death or when the wounds, disease, or injury resulting in death were incurred, is considered for purposes of this section as serving in a combat zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The exemption from tax granted by section 2201 does not apply to the basic estate tax as defined in section 2011(d).</p>
