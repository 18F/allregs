Appendix A to Part 58--Guidelines for Reviewing Applications for</p><p class="depth0">Compensation and Reimbursement of Expenses Filed Under 11 U.S.C. 330</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General Information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994  amended the responsibilities of the United States Trustees under 28  U.S.C. 586(a)(3)(A) to provide that, whenever they deem appropriate,  United States Trustees will review applications for compensation and  reimbursement of expenses under section 330 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11  U.S.C. 101, et seq. (``Code''), in accordance with procedural guidelines  (``Guidelines'') adopted by the Executive Office for United States  Trustees (``Executive Office''). The following Guidelines have been  adopted by the Executive Office and are to be uniformly applied by the  United States Trustees except when circumstances warrant different  treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The United States Trustees shall use these Guidelines in all  cases commenced on or after October 22, 1994.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Guidelines are not intended to supersede local rules of  court, but should be read as complementing the procedures set forth in  local rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in the Guidelines should be construed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To limit the United States Trustee's discretion to request  additional information necessary for the review of a particular  application or type of application or to refer any information provided  to the United States Trustee to any investigatory or prosecutorial  authority of the United States or a state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To limit the United States Trustee's discretion to determine  whether to file comments or objections to applications; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To create any private right of action on the part of any  person enforceable in litigation with the United States Trustee or the  United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recognizing that the final authority to award compensation and  reimbursement under section 330 of the Code is vested in the Court, the  Guidelines focus on the disclosure of information relevant to a proper  award under the law. In evaluating fees for professional services, it is  relevant to consider various factors including the following: the time  spent; the rates charged; whether the services were necessary to the  administration of, or beneficial towards the completion of, the case at  the time they were rendered; whether services were performed within a  reasonable time commensurate with the complexity, importance, and nature  of the problem, issue, or task addressed; and whether compensation is  reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by comparably  skilled practitioners in non-bankruptcy cases. The Guidelines thus  reflect standards and procedures articulated in section 330 of the Code  and Rule 2016 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure for awarding  compensation to trustees and to professionals employed under section 327  or 1103. Applications that contain the information requested in these  Guidelines will facilitate review by the Court, the parties, and the  United States Trustee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fee applications submitted by trustees are subject to the same  standard of review as are applications of other professionals and will  be evaluated according to the principles articulated in these  Guidelines. Each United States Trustee should establish whether and to  what extent trustees can deviate from the format specified in these  Guidelines without substantially affecting the ability of the United  States Trustee to review and comment on their fee applications in a  manner consistent with the requirements of the law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of Applications for Compensation and Reimbursement of  Expenses. All applications should include sufficient detail to  demonstrate compliance with the standards set forth in 11 U.S.C.  Sec. 330. The fee application should also contain sufficient information  about the case and the applicant so that the Court, the creditors, and  the United States Trustee can review it without searching for relevant  information in other documents. The following will facilitate review of  the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information about the Applicant and the Application. The  following information should be provided in every fee application:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Date the bankruptcy petition was filed, date of the order  approving employment, identity of the party represented, date services  commenced, and whether the applicant is seeking compensation under a  provision of the Bankruptcy Code other than section 330.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Terms and conditions of employment and compensation, source of  compensation, existence and terms controlling use of a retainer, and any  budgetary or other limitations on fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Names and hourly rates of all applicant's professionals and  paraprofessionals who billed time, explanation of any changes in hourly  rates from those previously charged, and statement of whether the  compensation is based on the customary compensation charged by  comparably skilled practitioners in cases other than cases under title  11.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the application is interim or final, and the dates of  previous orders on interim compensation or reimbursement of expenses  along with the amounts requested and the amounts allowed or disallowed,  amounts of all previous payments, and amount of any allowed fees and  expenses remaining unpaid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the person on whose behalf the applicant is employed has  been given the opportunity to review the application and   whether that person has approved the requested amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When an application is filed less than 120 days after the order  for relief or after a prior application to the Court, the date and terms  of the order allowing leave to file at shortened intervals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Time period of the services or expenses covered by the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Case Status. The following information should be provided to the  extent that it is known to or can be reasonably ascertained by the  applicant:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a chapter 7 case, a summary of the administration of the case  including all moneys received and disbursed in the case, when the case  is expected to close, and, if applicant is seeking an interim award,  whether it is feasible to make an interim distribution to creditors  without prejudicing the rights of any creditor holding a claim of equal  or higher priority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a chapter 11 case, whether a plan and disclosure statement  have been filed and, if not yet filed, when the plan and disclosure  statement are expected to be filed; whether all quarterly fees have been  paid to the United States Trustee; and whether all monthly operating  reports have been filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In every case, the amount of cash on hand or on deposit, the  amount and nature of accrued unpaid administrative expenses, and the  amount of unencumbered funds in the estate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any material changes in the status of the case that occur after  the filing of the fee application should be raised, orally or in  writing, at the hearing on the application or, if a hearing is not  required, prior to the expiration of the time period for objection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Summary Sheet. All applications should contain a summary or  cover sheet that provides a synopsis of the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Total compensation and expenses requested and any amount(s)  previously requested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Total compensation and expenses previously awarded by the  court;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name and applicable billing rate for each person who billed  time during the period, and date of bar admission for each attorney;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Total hours billed and total amount of billing for each person  who billed time during billing period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Computation of blended hourly rate for persons who billed time  during period, excluding paralegal or other paraprofessional time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Project Billing Format. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To facilitate effective review of  the application, all time and service entries should be arranged by  project categories. The project categories set forth in exhibit A should  be used to the extent applicable. A separate project category should be  used for administrative matters and, if payment is requested, for fee  application preparation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The United States Trustee has discretion to determine that the  project billing format is not necessary in a particular case or in a  particular class of cases. Applicants should be encouraged to consult  with the United States Trustee if there is a question as to the need for  project billing in any particular case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each project category should contain a narrative summary of  the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> a description of the project, its necessity and benefit to the  estate, and the status of the project including all pending litigation  for which compensation and reimbursement are requested;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> identification of each person providing services on the project;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> a statement of the number of hours spent and the amount of  compensation requested for each professional and paraprofessional on the  project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Time and service entries are to be reported in chronological  order under the appropriate project category.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Time entries should be kept contemporaneously with the services  rendered in time periods of tenths of an hour. Services should be noted  in detail and not combined or ``lumped'' together, with each service  showing a separate time entry; however, tasks performed in a project  which total a de minimis amount of time can be combined or lumped  together if they do not exceed .5 hours on a daily aggregate. Time  entries for telephone calls, letters, and other communications should  give sufficient detail to identify the parties to and the nature of the  communication. Time entries for court hearings and conferences should  identify the subject of the hearing or conference. If more than one  professional from the applicant firm attends a hearing or conference,  the applicant should explain the need for multiple attendees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reimbursement for Actual, Necessary Expenses. Any expense for  which reimbursement is sought must be actual and necessary and supported  by documentation as appropriate. Factors relevant to a determination  that the expense is proper include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the expense is reasonable and economical. For example,  first class and other luxurious travel mode or accommodations will  normally be objectionable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the requested expenses are customarily charged to non- bankruptcy clients of the applicant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether applicant has provided a detailed itemization of all  expenses including the date incurred, description of expense (e.g., type  of travel, type of fare, rate, destination), method of computation, and,  where relevant, name of the person incurring   the expense and purpose of the expense. Itemized expenses should be  identified by their nature (e.g., long distance telephone, copy costs,  messengers, computer research, airline travel, etc,) and by the month  incurred. Unusual items require more detailed explanations and should be  allocated, where practicable, to specific projects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether applicant has prorated expenses where appropriate  between the estate and other cases (e.g., travel expenses applicable to  more than one case) and has adequately explained the basis for any such  proration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether expenses incurred by the applicant to third parties are  limited to the actual amounts billed to, or paid by, the applicant on  behalf of the estate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether applicant can demonstrate that the amount requested for  expenses incurred in-house reflect the actual cost of such expenses to  the applicant. The United States Trustee may establish an objection  ceiling for any in-house expenses that are routinely incurred and for  which the actual cost cannot easily be determined by most professionals  (e.g., photocopies, facsimile charges, and mileage).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Whether the expenses appear to be in the nature  nonreimbursable overhead. Overhead consists of all continuous  administrative or general costs incident to the operation of the  applicant's office and not particularly attributable to an individual  client or case. Overhead includes, but is not limited to, word  processing, proofreading, secretarial and other clerical services, rent,  utilities, office equipment and furnishings, insurance, taxes, local  telephones and monthly car phone charges, lighting, heating and cooling,  and library and publication charges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Whether applicant has adhered to allowable rates for expenses  as fixed by local rule or order of the Court.</p><p class="depth4">Exhibit A--Project Categories</p><p class="depth4">Here is a list of suggested project categories for use in most  bankruptcy cases. Only one category should be used for a given activity.  Professionals should make their best effort to be consistent in their  use of categories, whether within a particular firm or by different  firms working on the same case. It would be appropriate for all  professionals to discuss the categories in advance and agree generally  on how activities will be categorized. This list is not exclusive. The  application may contain additional categories as the case requires. They  are generally more applicable to attorneys in chapter 7 and chapter 11,  but may be used by all professionals as appropriate.</p><p class="depth4">Asset Analysis and Recovery: Identification and review of potential  assets including causes of action and non-litigation recoveries.</p><p class="depth4">Asset Disposition: Sales, leases (Sec. 365 matters), abandonment and  related transaction work.</p><p class="depth4">Business Operations: Issues related to debtor-in-possession  operating in chapter 11 such as employee, vendor, tenant issues and  other similar problems.</p><p class="depth4">Case Administration: Coordination and compliance activities,  including preparation of statement of financial affairs; schedules; list  of contracts; United States Trustee interim statements and operating  reports; contacts with the United States Trustee; general creditor  inquiries.</p><p class="depth4">Claims Administration and Objections: Specific claim inquiries; bar  date motions; analyses, objections and allowances of claims.</p><p class="depth4">Employee Benefits/Pensions: Review issues such as severance,  retention, 401K coverage and continuance of pension plan.</p><p class="depth4">Fee/Employment Applicants: Preparation of employment and fee  applications for self or others; motions to establish interim  procedures.</p><p class="depth4">Fee/Employment Objections: Review of and objections to the  employment and fee applications of others.</p><p class="depth4">Financing: Matters under Secs. 361, 363 and 364 including cash  collateral and secured claims; loan document analysis.</p><p class="depth4">Litigation: There should be a separate category established for each  matter (e.g., XYZ Litigation).</p><p class="depth4">Meetings of Creditors: Preparing for and attending the conference of  creditors, the Sec. 341(a) meeting and other creditors' committee  meetings.</p><p class="depth4">Plan and Disclosure Statement: Formulation, presentation and  confirmation; compliance with the plan confirmation order, related  orders and rules; disbursement and case closing activities, except those  related to the allowance and objections to allowance of claims.</p><p class="depth4">Relief From Stay Proceedings: Matters relating to termination or  continuation of automatic stay under Sec. 362.</p><p class="depth4">The following categories are generally more applicable to  accountants and financial advisors, but may be used by all professionals  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth4">Accounting/Auditing: Activities related to maintaining and auditing  books of account, preparation of financial statements and account  analysis.</p><p class="depth4">Business Analysis: Preparation and review of company business plan;  development and review of strategies; preparation and review of cash  flow forecasts and feasibility studies.</p><p class="depth4">Corporate Finance: Review financial aspects of potential mergers,  acquisitions and disposition of company or subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth4">Data Analysis: Management information systems review, installation  and analysis, construction, maintenance and reporting of significant  case financial data, lease rejection, claims, etc.</p><p class="depth4">Litigation Consulting: Providing consulting and expert witness  services relating to various bankruptcy matters such as insolvency,  feasibility, avoiding actions, forensic accounting, etc.</p><p class="depth4">Reconstruction Accounting: Reconstructing books and records from  past transactions and bringing accounting current.</p><p class="depth4">Tax Issues: Analysis of tax issues and preparation of state and  federal tax returns.</p><p class="depth4">Valuation: Appraise or review appraisals of assets.
