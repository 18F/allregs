                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for activities that have the potential to result in serious injury or mortality, which must be authorized under Sec.  216.105, incidental harassment authorizations may be issued, following a 30-day public review period, to allowed activities that may result in only the incidental harassment of a small number of marine mammals. Each such incidental harassment authorization shall set forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permissible methods of taking by harassment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of an incidental harassment authorization will be based on a determination that the number of marine mammals taken by harassment will be small, will have a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal(s), and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of species or stocks for taking for subsistence uses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An incidental harassment authorization will be either issued or denied within 45 days after the close of the public review period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of issuance or denial of an incidental harassment authorization will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance of a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Incidental harassment authorizations will be valid for a period of time not to exceed 1 year but may be renewed for additional periods of time not to exceed 1 year for each reauthorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An incidental harassment authorization shall be modified, withdrawn, or suspended if, after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditions and requirements prescribed in the authorization are not being substantially complied with; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The authorized taking, either individually or in combination with other authorizations, is having, or may have, more than a negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock for subsistence uses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply if the Assistant Administrator determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A violation of any of the terms and conditions of an incidental harassment authorization shall subject the

holder and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the holder's incidental harassment authorization to penalties provided in the MMPA.</p>
