A plant or installation that operates a locomotive to switch or move cars for other entities, even if solely within the confines of the plant or installation, rather than for its own purposes or industrial processes, will not be considered a plant railroad because the performance of such activity makes the operation part of the general railroad system of transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Qualified means that a person has successfully completed all instruction, training, and examination programs required by both the employer and this part, and that the person, therefore, may reasonably be expected to proficiently perform his or her duties in compliance with all Federal railroad safety laws, regulations, and orders.</p><p class="depth0">Refresher training means periodic retraining required by an employer for each safety-related railroad employee to remain qualified.</p><p class="depth0">Safety-related duty means either a safety-related task or a knowledge-based prohibition that a person meeting the definition of a safety-related railroad employee is required to comply with, when such duty is covered by any Federal railroad safety law, regulation, or order.</p><p class="depth0">Safety-related railroad employee means an individual who is engaged or compensated by an employer to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Perform work covered under the hours of service laws found at 49 U.S.C. 21101, et seq.;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Perform work as an operating railroad employee who is not subject to the hours of service laws found at 49 U.S.C. 21101, et seq.;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> In the application of parts 213 and 214 of this chapter, inspect, install, repair, or maintain track, roadbed, and signal and communication systems, including a roadway worker or railroad bridge worker as defined in Sec. 214.7 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Inspect, repair, or maintain locomotives, passenger cars or freight cars;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Inspect, repair, or maintain other railroad on-track equipment when such equipment is in a service that constitutes a train movement under part 232 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Determine that an on-track roadway maintenance machine or hi-rail vehicle may be used in accordance with part 214, subpart D of this chapter, without repair of a non-complying condition;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Directly instruct, mentor, inspect, or test, as a primary duty, any person while that other person is engaged in a safety-related task; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> Directly supervise the performance of safety-related duties in connection with periodic oversight in accordance with Sec. 243.205.</p><p class="depth2">Safety-related task means a task that a person meeting the definition of a safety-related railroad employee performs, when such task is covered by any Federal railroad safety law, regulation, or order.</p><p class="depth2">Task-based training means a type of formal training with a primary focus on teaching the skills necessary to perform specific tasks that require some degree of neuromuscular coordination.</p><p class="depth2">Tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation means a tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operation conducted only on track used exclusively for that purpose (i.e., there is no freight, intercity passenger, or commuter passenger railroad operation on the track).</p>
