A transfer or pledge of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities effected under this paragraph shall have priority over any transfer, pledge, or other interest, theretofore or thereafter effected or perfected under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or any other manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A transfer or pledge of transferable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities, or any interest therein, which is maintained by a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) in a book-entry account under this subpart, including securities in book-entry form under Sec. 1901.506(b)(1)(iii) is effected, and a pledge is perfected by any means that would be effective under applicable law to effect a transfer or to effect and perfect a pledge of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities, or any interest therein, if the securities were maintained by the Reserve bank in bearer definitive form. For purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities maintained by a Reserve bank shall, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be deemed to be maintained in bearer definitive form. A Reserve bank maintaining book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities, either in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States, is not a bailee for the purposes of notification of pledges of these securities under this paragraph, or a third person in possession for the purposes of acknowledgment of transfers thereof under this paragraph. Where transferable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities are recorded on the books of a depositary (a bank, banking institution, financial firm, or similar party, which regularly accepts in the course of its business FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities as a custodial service for customers, and maintains accounts in the names of such customers reflecting ownership of or interest in such securities) for account of the pledgor or transferor thereof and such securities are on deposit with a Reserve bank in a book-entry account hereunder, such depositary shall, for purposes of perfecting a pledge of such securities or effecting delivery of such securities to a purchaser under applicable provisions of law, be the bailee to which notification of the pledge of the securities may be given or the third person in possession from which acknowledgment of the holding of the securities for the purchaser may be obtained. A Reserve bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph and any such notice or advice shall have no effect. A Reserve bank may continue to deal with its depositor in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, notwithstanding any transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No filing or recording with a public recording office or officer shall be necessary or effective with respect to any transfer or pledge of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities or any interest therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A Reserve bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions, convert book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities into definitive FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions. No such conversion shall affect existing interest in such FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A transfer of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities within a Federal Reserve Bank shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Reserve bank not inconsistent with this subpart. The transfer of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities by

a Reserve bank may be made through a telegraphic transfer procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All requests for transfer or withdrawal must be made prior to the maturity or date of call of the securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Withdrawal of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities.

A Reserve bank which has received FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities and effected pledges, made entries regarding them, or transferred or delivered them according to the instructions of its depositor is not liable for conversion or for participation in breach of fiduciary duty even though the depositor had no right to dispose of or take other action in respect of the securities. A Reserve bank shall be fully discharged of its obligations under this subpart by the delivery of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities in definitive form to its depositor or upon the order of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other depositary (other than a Reserve bank) may obtain FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities in definitive form only by causing the depositor of the Reserve bank to order the withdrawal thereof from the Reserve bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Registered securities.
