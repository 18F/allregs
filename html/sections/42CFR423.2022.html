For  expedited hearings, the ALJ may orally provide notice of the hearing to  the enrollee and other potential participants but oral notice must be  followed by an equivalent written notice within 1 calendar day of the  oral notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice of hearing contains a  statement of the specific issues to be decided and will inform the  enrollee that he or she may designate a person to represent him or her  during the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice must include an explanation of the procedures for  requesting a change in the time or place of the hearing, a reminder  that, if the enrollee fails to appear at the scheduled hearing without  good cause, the ALJ may dismiss the hearing request, and   other information about the scheduling and conduct of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The enrollee will also be told if his or her appearance or that  of any other witness is scheduled by video-teleconferencing, telephone,  or in person. If the ALJ has scheduled the enrollee to appear at the  hearing by video-teleconferencing, the notice of hearing will advise  that the scheduled place for the hearing is a video-teleconferencing  site and explain what it means to appear at the hearing by video- teleconferencing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The notice advises the enrollee that if he or she objects to  appearing by video-teleconferencing or telephone, and wishes instead to  have his or her hearing at a time and place where he or she may appear  in person before the ALJ, he or she must follow the procedures set forth  at Sec. 423.2020(i) for notifying the ALJ of his or her objections and  for requesting an in-person hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acknowledging the notice of hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the enrollee or his  or her representative does not acknowledge receipt of the notice of  hearing, the ALJ hearing office attempts to contact the enrollee for an  explanation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the enrollee states that he or she did not receive the notice  of hearing, an amended notice is sent to him or her by certified mail  or, if available, fax or e-mail. See Sec. 423.2052 for the procedures  the ALJ follows in deciding if the time or place of a scheduled hearing  will be changed if an enrollee does not respond to the notice of  hearing).</p>
