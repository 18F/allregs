                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies the information that must be in your  application, unless we ask you to include less information under Sec.   1042.201(c). We may require you to provide additional information to  evaluate your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Describe the engine family's specifications and other basic  parameters of the engine's design and emission controls. List the fuel  type on which your engines are designed to operate (for example, ultra  low-sulfur diesel fuel). List each distinguishable engine configuration  in the engine family. For each engine configuration, list the maximum  engine power and the range of values for maximum engine power resulting  from production tolerances, as described in Sec.  1042.140.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explain how the emission control system operates. Describe in  detail all system components for controlling exhaust emissions,  including any auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) you add to the  engine. Identify the part number of each component you describe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Summarize your cost effectiveness analysis used to demonstrate  your system will meet the availability criteria of Sec.  1042.815.  Identify the maximum allowable costs for vessel modifications to meet  the these criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Describe the engines you selected for testing and the reasons  for selecting them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used,  including the duty cycle(s) and the corresponding engine applications.  Also describe any special or alternate test procedures you used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Describe how you operated the emission-data engine before  testing, including the duty cycle and the number of engine operating  hours used to stabilize emission levels. Explain why you   selected the method of service accumulation. Describe any scheduled  maintenance you did.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls  within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065. See Sec.   1042.801 if your certification is based on the use of special fuels or  additives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Identify the engine family's useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Include the maintenance and warranty instructions you will give  to the owner/operator (see Sec. Sec.  1042.120 and 1042.125).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Include the emission-related installation instructions you will  provide if someone else installs your engines in a vessel (see Sec.   1042.130).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Describe your emission control information label (see Sec.   1042.830).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Identify the engine family's deterioration factors and describe  how you developed them (see Sec.  1042.245). Present any emission test  data you used for this.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> State that you operated your emission-data engines as described  in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and  test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Present emission data for HC, NOX, PM, and CO as  required by Sec.  1042.820. Show emission figures before and after  applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors  for each pollutant and for each engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Report all test results, including those from invalid tests,  whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of  subpart F of this part. If you measure CO2, report those  emission levels. We may ask you to send other information to confirm  that your tests were valid under the requirements of this part and 40  CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Describe all adjustable operating parameters (see Sec.   1042.115(d)), including production tolerances. Include the following in  your description of each parameter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nominal or recommended setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The intended physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The limits or stops used to establish adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For Category 1 engines, information showing why the limits,  stops, or other means of inhibiting adjustment are effective in  preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings  outside your intended physically adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For Category 2 engines, propose a range of adjustment for each  adjustable parameter, as described in Sec.  1042.115(d). Include  information showing why the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting  adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in- use engines to settings outside your proposed adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine  family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts  of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Include the information required by other subparts of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Include other applicable information, such as information  specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for  exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service  on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or  employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States  related to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> If you are not the original manufacturer of the engine, include  a summary of your contact with the original manufacturer of the engine  and provide to us any documentation provided to you by the original  manufacturer.</p>
