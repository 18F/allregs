An electronic trading facility  relying upon the exemption set forth in this section, with respect to  agreements, contracts or transactions that are not significant price  discovery contracts, shall not represent to any person that it is  registered with, designated, recognized, licensed or approved by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Significant price discovery contracts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for  significant price discovery determination. The Commission may determine,  in its discretion, that an electronic trading facility operating a  market in reliance on the exemption set forth in this section performs a  significant price discovery function for transactions in the cash market  for a commodity underlying any agreement, contract or transaction  executed or traded on the facility. In making such a determination, the  Commission shall consider, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Price linkage. The extent to which the agreement, contract or  transaction uses or otherwise relies on a daily or final settlement  price, or other major price parameter, of a contract or contracts listed  for trading on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market,  or a significant price discovery contract traded on an electronic  trading facility, to value a position, transfer or convert a position,  cash or financially settle a position, or close out a position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Arbitrage. The extent to which the price for the agreement,  contract or transaction is sufficiently related to the price of a  contract or contracts listed for trading on or subject to the rules of a  designated contract market, or a significant price discovery contract or  contracts trading on or subject to the rules of an electronic trading  facility, so as to permit market participants to effectively arbitrage  between the markets by simultaneously maintaining positions or executing  trades in the contracts on a frequent and recurring basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Material price reference. The extent to which, on a frequent  and recurring basis, bids, offers, or transactions in a commodity are  directly based on, or are determined by referencing, the prices  generated by agreements, contracts or transactions being traded or  executed on the electronic trading facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Material liquidity. The extent to which the volume of  agreements, contracts or transactions in the commodity being traded on  the electronic trading facility is sufficient to have a material effect  on other agreements, contracts or transactions listed for trading on or  subject to the rules of a   designated contract market or an electronic trading facility operating  in reliance on the exemption set forth in this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other material factors. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notification of possible significant price discovery contract  conditions. An electronic trading facility operating in reliance on the  exemption set forth in this section shall promptly notify the  Commission, and such notification shall be accompanied by supporting  information or data concerning any contract that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Averaged five trades per day or more over the most recent  calendar quarter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For which the exchange sells its price information regarding  the contract to market participants or industry publications; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whose daily closing or settlement prices on 95 percent or more  of the days in the most recent quarter were within 2.5 percent of the  contemporaneously determined closing, settlement or other daily price of  another agreement, contract or transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedure for significant price discovery determination. Before  making a final price discovery determination under this paragraph, the  Commission shall publish notice in the Federal Register that it intends  to undertake a determination with respect to whether a particular  agreement, contract or transaction performs a significant price  discovery function and to receive written data, views and arguments  relevant to its determination from the electronic trading facility and  other interested persons. Any such written data, views and arguments  shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, in the form and  manner specified by the Commission, within 30 calendar days of  publication of notice in the Federal Register or within such other time  specified by the Commission. After prompt consideration of all relevant  information, the Commission shall, within a reasonable period of time  after the close of the comment period, issue an order explaining its  determination whether the agreement, contract or transaction executed or  traded by the electronic trading facility performs a significant price  discovery function under the criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i)  through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Compliance with core principles. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Following the issuance of  an order by the Commission that the electronic trading facility executes  or trades an agreement, contract or transaction that performs a  significant price discovery function, the electronic trading facility  must demonstrate, with respect to that agreement, contract or  transaction, compliance with the Core Principles set forth in this  section and the applicable provisions of this part. If the Commission's  order represents the first time it has determined that one of the  electronic trading facility's agreements, contracts or transactions  performs a significant price discovery function, the facility must  submit a written demonstration of compliance with the Core Principles  within 90 calendar days of the date of the Commission's order. For each  subsequent determination by the Commission that the electronic trading  facility has an additional agreement, contract or transaction that  performs a significant price discovery function, the facility must  submit a written demonstration of compliance with the Core Principles  within 30 calendar days of the date of the Commission's order. Attention  is directed to appendix B of this part for guidance on and acceptable  practices for complying with the Core Principles. Submissions  demonstrating how the electronic trading facility complies with the Core  Principles with respect to its significant price discovery contract must  be filed with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC  headquarters. Submissions must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A written certification that the significant price discovery  contract(s) complies with the Act and regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A copy of the electronic trading facility's rules (as defined in  Sec. 40.1 of this chapter) and any technical manuals, other guides or  instructions for users of, or participants in, the market, including  minimum financial standards for members or market participants.  Subsequent rule changes must be certified by the electronic trading  facility pursuant to section   5c(c) of the Act and Sec. 40.6 of this chapter. The electronic trading  facility also may request Commission approval of any rule changes  pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act and Sec. 40.5 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the trading system, algorithm, security and  access limitation procedures with a timeline for an order from input  through settlement, and a copy of any system test procedures, tests  conducted, test results and contingency or disaster recovery plans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A copy of any documents pertaining to or describing the  electronic trading system's legal status and governance structure,  including governance fitness information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An executed or executable copy of any agreements or contracts  entered into or to be entered into by the electronic trading facility,  including partnership or limited liability company, third-party  regulatory service, or member or user agreements, that enable or empower  the electronic trading facility to comply with a Core Principle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A copy of any manual or other document describing, with  specificity, the manner in which the trading facility will conduct trade  practice, market and financial surveillance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> To the extent that any of the items in paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A)  through (F) of this section raise issues that are novel, or for which  compliance with a Core Principle is not self-evident, an explanation of  how that item satisfies the applicable Core Principle or Principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The electronic trading facility must identify with  particularity information in the submission that will be subject to a  request for confidential treatment pursuant to Sec. 145.09 of this  chapter. The electronic trading facility must follow the procedures  specified in Sec. 40.8 of this chapter with respect to any information  in its submission for which confidential treatment is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determination of compliance with core principles. The Commission  shall take into consideration differences between cleared and uncleared  significant price discovery contracts when reviewing the implementation  of the Core Principles by an electronic trading facility. The electronic  facility has reasonable discretion in accounting for differences between  cleared and uncleared significant price discovery contracts when  establishing the manner in which it complies with the Core Principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Information relating to compliance with core principles. Upon  request by the Commission, an electronic trading facility trading a  significant price discovery contract shall file with the Commission a  written demonstration, containing such supporting data, information and  documents, in the form and manner and within such time as the Commission  may specify, that the electronic trading facility is in compliance with  one or more Core Principles as specified in the request, or that is  otherwise requested by the Commission to enable the Commission to  satisfy its obligations under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Enforceability. An agreement, contract or transaction entered  into on or pursuant to the rules of an electronic trading facility  trading or executing a significant price discovery contract shall not be  void, voidable, subject to rescission or otherwise invalidated or  rendered unenforceable as a result of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A violation by the electronic trading facility of the provisions  set forth in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any Commission proceeding to alter or supplement a rule, term  or condition under section 8a(7) of the Act, to declare an emergency  under section 8a(9) of the Act, or any other proceeding the effect of  which is to alter, supplement or require an electronic trading facility  to adopt a specific term or condition, trading rule or procedure, or to  take or refrain from taking a specific action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Procedures for vacating a determination of a significant price  discovery function--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By the electronic trading facility. An  electronic trading facility that executes or trades an agreement,  contract or transaction that the Commission has determined performs a  significant price discovery function under paragraph (d)(3) of this  section may petition the Commission to vacate that determination. The  petition shall demonstrate that the agreement, contract or transaction  no longer performs a   significant price discovery function under the criteria specified in  paragraph (d)(1), and has not done so for at least the prior 12 months.  An electronic trading facility shall not petition for a vacation of a  significant price discovery determination more frequently than once  every 12 months for any individual contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By the Commission. The Commission may, on its own initiative,  begin vacation proceedings if it believes that an agreement, contract or  transaction has not performed a significant price discovery function for  at least the prior 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedure. Before making a final determination whether an  agreement, contract or transaction has ceased to perform a significant  price discovery function, the Commission shall publish notice in the  Federal Register that it intends to undertake such a determination and  to receive written data, views and arguments relevant to its  determination from the electronic trading facility and other interested  persons. Written submissions shall be filed with the Secretary of the  Commission in the form and manner specified by the Commission, within 30  calendar days of publication of notice in the Federal Register, or  within such other time specified by the Commission. After consideration  of all relevant information, the Commission shall issue an order  explaining its determination whether the agreement, contract or  transaction has ceased to perform a significant price discovery function  and, if so, vacating its prior order. If such an order issues, and the  Commission subsequently determines, on its own initiative or after  notification by the electronic trading facility, that the agreement,  contract or transaction that was subject to the vacation order again  performs a significant price discovery function, the electronic trading  facility must comply with the Core Principles within 30 calendar days of  the date of the Commission's order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic vacation of significant price discovery  determination. Regardless of whether a proceeding to vacate has been  initiated, any significant price discovery contract that has no open  interest and in which no trading has occurred for a period of 12  complete and consecutive calendar months shall, without further  proceedings, no longer be considered to be a significant price discovery  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Commission review. The Commission shall, at least annually,  evaluate as appropriate agreements, contracts or transactions conducted  on an electronic trading facility in reliance on the exemption set forth  in this section to determine whether they serve a significant price  discovery function as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.  [77 FR 66336, Nov. 2, 2012]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 36--Guidance on Significant Price Discovery</p><p class="depth0">Contracts</p><p class="depth0">1. There are four factors that the Commission must consider, as  appropriate, in making a determination that a contract is performing a  significant price discovery function. The four factors prescribed by the  statute are: Price Linkage; Arbitrage; Material Price Reference; and  Material Liquidity.</p><p class="depth0">2. Not all listed factors must be present to support a determination  that a contract performs a significant price discovery function.  Moreover, the statutory language neither prioritizes the factors nor  specifies the degree to which a significant price discovery contract  must conform to the various factors. Congress has indicated that it  intends that the Commission should not make a determination that an  agreement, contract or transaction performs a significant price  discovery function on the basis of the Price Linkage factor unless the  agreement, contract or transaction also has sufficient volume to impact  other regulated contracts or to become an independent price reference or  benchmark that is regularly utilized by the public. The Commission  believes that the Arbitrage and Material Price Reference factors can be  considered separately from each other. That is, the Commission could  make a determination that a contract serves a significant price  discovery function based on the presence of one of these factors and the  absence of the other. The presence of any of these factors, however,  would not necessarily be sufficient to establish the contract as a  significant price discovery contract. The fourth factor, Liquidity,  would be considered in conjunction with the arbitrage and linkage  factors as a significant amount of liquidity presumably would be  necessary for a contract to perform a significant price discovery  function in conjunction with these factors.</p><p class="depth0">3. These factors do not lend themselves to a mechanical checklist or  formulaic analysis. Accordingly, this guidance is intended to illustrate  which factors, or combinations   of factors, the Commission will look to when determining that a contract  is performing a significant price discovery function, and under what  circumstances the presence of a particular factor or factors would be  sufficient to support such a determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> MATERIAL LIQUIDITY--The extent to which the volume of  agreements, contracts or transactions in the commodity being traded on  the electronic trading facility is sufficient to have a material effect  on other agreements, contracts or transactions listed for trading on or  subject to the rules of a designated contract market, or an electronic  trading facility operating in reliance on the exemption set forth in  this section.</p><p class="depth0">1. Liquidity is a broad concept that captures the ability to  transact immediately with little or no price concession. Traditionally,  objective measures of trading such as volume or open interest have been  used as measures of liquidity. So, for example, a market in which trades  occur multiple times per minute at prices that differ by only fractions  of a cent normally would be considered highly liquid, since presumably a  trader could quickly execute a trade at a price that was approximately  the same as the price for other recently executed trades. Other factors  also will affect the characterization of liquidity, such as whether a  large trade--e.g., 100 contracts versus 1 contract--could be executed  without a significant price concession. For example, having to wait a  day to sell 1000 bushels of corn may be considered an illiquid market  while waiting a day to sell a home may be considered quite liquid. Thus,  quantifying the levels of immediacy and price concession that would  define material liquidity may differ from one market or commodity to  another.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Commission believes that material liquidity alternatively can  be identified by the impact liquidity exhibits through observed prices.  In markets where material liquidity exists, a more or less continuous  stream of prices can be observed and the prices should be similar. For  example, if the trading of a contract occurs on average five times a  day, there will be on average five observed prices for the contract per  day. If the market is liquid in terms of traders having to make little  in the way of price concessions to execute these trades, the prices of  this contract should be similar to those observed for similar or related  contracts traded in liquid markets elsewhere. Thus, in making  determinations that contracts have material liquidity, the Commission  will look to transaction prices, both in terms of how often prices are  observed and the extent to which observed prices tend to correlate with  other contemporaneous prices.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Commission anticipates that material liquidity will  frequently be a consideration in evaluating whether a contract is a  significant price discovery contract; however, there may be  circumstances in which other factors so dominate the conclusion that a  contract is serving a significant price discovery function that a  finding of material liquidity in the contract would not be necessary.  Circumstances in which this might arise are discussed with respect to  the assessment of other factors below.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finally, material liquidity itself would not be sufficient to  make a determination that a contract is a significant price discovery  contract, but combined with other factors it can serve as a guidepost  indicating which contracts are functioning as significant price  discovery contracts. As further discussed below, material liquidity, as  reflected through the prices of linked or arbitraged contracts, will be  a primary consideration in determining whether such contracts are  significant price discovery contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> PRICE LINKAGE--The extent to which the agreement, contract or  transaction uses or otherwise relies on a daily or final settlement  price, or other major price parameter, of a contract or contracts listed  for trading on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market,  or a significant price discovery contract traded on an electronic  trading facility, to value a position, transfer or convert a position,  cash or financially settle a position, or close out a position.</p><p class="depth0">1. A price-linked contract is a contract that relies on a contract  traded on another trading facility to settle, value or otherwise offset  the price-linked contract. The link may involve a one-to-one linkage, in  that the value of the linked contract is based on a single contract's  price, or it may involve multiple contracts. An example of a multiple  contract linkage might be where the settlement price is calculated as an  index of prices obtained from a basket of contracts traded on other  exchanges.</p><p class="depth0">2. For a linked contract, the mere fact that a contract is linked to  another contract will not be sufficient to support a determination that  a contract performs a significant price discovery function. To assess  whether such a determination is warranted, the Commission will examine  the relationship between transaction prices of the linked contract and  the prices of the referenced contract(s). The Commission believes that  where material liquidity exists, prices for the linked contract would be  observed to be substantially the same as or move substantially in  conjunction with the prices of the referenced contract(s). Where such  price characteristics are observed on an ongoing basis, the Commission  would expect to determine that the linked contract is a significant  price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0">3. As an example, where the Commission has observed price linkage,  it will next consider whether transactions were occurring on   a daily basis for the linked contract in material volumes. (Conversely,  where volume has increased noticeably in a particular contract, the  Commission would look for linkage) The ultimate level of volume that  would be considered material for purposes of deeming a contract a  significant price discovery contract will likely differ from one  contract to another depending on the characteristics of the underlying  commodity and the overall size of the physical market in which it is  traded. At a minimum, however, the Commission will consider a linked  contract which has volume equal to 5% of the volume of trading in the  contract to which it is linked to have sufficient volume potentially to  be deemed a significant price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0">4. In combination with this volume level, the Commission will also  examine the relationship between prices of the linked contract and the  contract to which it is linked to determine whether a contract is  serving a significant price discovery function. As a threshold, the  Commission will consider a 2.5 percent price range for 95 percent of  contemporaneously determined closing, settlement, or other daily prices  over the most recent quarter to be sufficiently close for a linked  contract potentially to be deemed a significant price discovery  contract. For example, if, over the most recent quarter, it was found  that 95 percent of the closing, settlement, or other daily prices of the  contract, which have been calculated using transaction prices, were  within 2.5 percent of the contemporaneously determined closing,  settlement, or other daily prices of a contract to which it was linked,  the Commission potentially would consider the contract to perform a  significant price discovery function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ARBITRAGE CONTRACTS--The extent to which the price for the  agreement, contract or transaction is sufficiently related to the price  of a contract or contracts listed for trading on or subject to the rules  of a designated contract market or a significant price discovery  contract or contracts trading on or subject to the rules of an  electronic trading facility, so as to permit market participants to  effectively arbitrage between the markets by simultaneously maintaining  positions or executing trades in the contracts on a frequent and  recurring basis.</p><p class="depth0">1. Arbitrage contracts are those contracts that can be combined with  other contracts to exploit expected economic relationships in  anticipation of a profit. In assessing whether a contract can be  incorporated into an arbitrage strategy, the Commission will weigh the  terms and conditions of a contract in comparison to contracts that  potentially could be used in an arbitrage strategy; will consult with  industry or other sources regarding a contract's viability in an  arbitrage strategy; and will rely on direct observation confirming the  use of a contract in arbitrage strategies.</p><p class="depth0">2. As with linked contracts, the mere fact that a contract could be  employed in an arbitrage strategy will not be sufficient to make a  determination that a contract is a significant price discovery contract.  In addition, the level of liquidity will be considered. To assess  whether designation as a significant price discovery contract is  warranted, the Commission will examine the relationship between  transaction prices of an arbitrage contract and the prices of the  contract(s) to which it is related. The Commission believes that where  material liquidity exists, prices for the arbitrage contract would be  observed to move substantially in conjunction with the prices of the  related contract(s) to which it is economically linked. Where such price  characteristics are observed on an ongoing basis, it is likely that the  linked contract performs a significant price discovery function.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Commission will apply the same threshold liquidity and price  relationship standards for arbitrage contracts as it does for linked  contracts. That is, the Commission will view the average of five trades  per day or more threshold as the level of activity that would  potentially meet the material volume criterion. With respect to prices,  the Commission will consider an arbitrage contract potentially to be a  significant price discovery contract if, over the most recent quarter,  greater than 95 percent of the closing or settlement prices of the  contract, which have been calculated using transaction prices, fall  within 2.5 percent of the closing or settlement price of the contract or  contracts to which it could be arbitraged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> MATERIAL PRICE REFERENCE--The extent to which, on a frequent and  recurring basis, bids, offers or transactions in a commodity are  directly based on, or are determined by referencing, the prices  generated by agreements, contracts or transactions being traded or  executed on the electronic trading facility.</p><p class="depth0">1. The Commission will rely on one of two sources of evidence-- direct or indirect--to determine that the price of a contract was being  used as a material price reference and, therefore, serving a significant  price discovery function. The primary source of direct evidence is that  cash market bids, offers or transactions are directly based on, or  quoted at a differential to, the prices generated on the market on a  frequent and recurring basis. The Commission expects that normally only  contracts with material liquidity will be referenced by the cash market;  however, the Commission notes that it may be possible for a contract to  have very low liquidity and yet still be used as a price reference. In  such cases, the simple fact that participants in the underlying cash  market broadly have elected to use the contract price as a price  reference would be a strong indicator that the contract is a significant  price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0">2. In evaluating a contract's price discovery role as a directly  referenced price source, the Commission will perform an analysis to  determine whether cash market participants are quoting bid or offer  prices or entering into transactions at prices that are set either  explicitly or implicitly at a differential to prices established for the  contract. Cash market prices are set explicitly at a differential to the  contract being traded on the electronic trading facility when, for  instance, they are quoted in dollars and cents above or below the  reference contract's price. Cash market prices are set implicitly at a  differential to a contract being traded on the electronic trading  facility when, for instance, they are arrived at after adding to, or  subtracting from the contract being traded on the electronic trading  facility, but then quoted or reported at a flat price. The Commission  will also consider whether cash market entities are quoting cash prices  based on a contract being traded on the electronic trading facility on a  frequent and recurring basis.</p><p class="depth0">3. The second source of evidence is that the price of the contract  is being routinely disseminated in widely distributed industry  publications--or offered by the ECM itself for some form of  remuneration--and consulted on a frequent and recurring basis by  industry participants in pricing cash market transactions. As with  contract prices that are directly incorporated into cash market prices,  the Commission assumes that industry publications choose to publish  prices because of the value they transfer to industry participants for  the purpose of formulating prices in the cash market.</p><p class="depth0">4. In applying this criterion, consideration will be given to  whether prices established by a contract being traded on the electronic  trading facility are reported in a widely distributed industry  publication. In making this determination, the Commission will consider  the reputation of the publication within the industry, how frequently it  is published, and whether the information contained in the publication  is routinely consulted by industry participants in pricing cash market  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">5. Under a Material Price Reference analysis, the Commission expects  that material liquidity in the contract likely will be the primary  motivation for a publisher to publish particular prices. In other words,  the fact that the price of a contract is being used as a reference by  industry participants suggests, prima facie, that the contract performs  a significant price discovery function. But the Commission recognizes  that trading levels could nonetheless be low for the contract while  still serving a significant price discovery function and that evidence  of routine publication and consultation by industry participants may be  sufficient to establish the contract as a significant price discovery  contract. On the other hand, while cash market participants may  regularly refer to published prices of a particular contract when  establishing cash market prices, it may be the case that the contract  itself is a niche market for a specialized grade of the commodity or for  delivery at a minor geographic location. In such cases, the Commission  will look to such measures as trading volume, open interest, and the  significance of the underlying cash market to make a determination that  a contract is functioning as a significant price discovery contract. If  an examination of trading in the contract were to reveal that true price  discovery was occurring in other more broadly defined contracts and that  this contract was itself simply reflective of those broader contracts,  it is less likely the Commission will deem the contract a significant  price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0">6. Because price referencing normally occurs out of the view of the  electronic trading facility, the Commission may have difficulty  ascertaining the extent to which cash market participants actually  reference or consult a contract's price when transacting. The Commission  expects, however, that as a contract begins to be relied upon to set a  reference price, market participants will be increasingly willing to  purchase price information. To the extent, then, that an electronic  trading facility begins to sell its price information regarding a  contract to market participants or industry publications, the contract  will meet a threshold standard to indicate that the contract potentially  is a significant price discovery contract.

Appendix B to Part 36--Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in,</p><p class="depth0">Compliance With Core Principles</p><p class="depth0">1. This appendix provides guidance on complying with the core  principles set forth in this part, both initially and on an ongoing  basis. The guidance is provided in paragraph (a) following each core  principle and can be used to demonstrate to the Commission core  principle compliance under Sec. 36.3(d)(4). The guidance for each core  principle is illustrative only of the types of matters an electronic  trading facility may address, as applicable, and is not intended to be  used as a mandatory checklist. Addressing the issues and questions set  forth in this guidance will help the Commission in its consideration of  whether the electronic trading facility is in compliance with the core  principles. A submission pursuant to Sec. 36.3(d)(4) should include an  explanation or other form of documentation demonstrating that the  electronic trading facility complies with the core principles.</p><p class="depth0">2. Acceptable practices meeting selected requirements of the core  principles are set forth in paragraph (b) following each core principle.  Electronic trading facilities on which significant price discovery  contracts are traded or executed that follow the specific practices  outlined under paragraph (b) for any core principle in this appendix  will meet the selected requirements of the applicable core principle.  Paragraph (b) is for illustrative purposes only, and does not state the  exclusive means for satisfying a core principle.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE I--CONTRACTS NOT READILY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPULATION.  The electronic trading facility shall list only significant price  discovery contracts that are not readily susceptible to manipulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. Upon determination by the Commission that a contract  listed for trading on an electronic trading facility is a significant  price discovery contract, the electronic trading facility must self- certify the terms and conditions of the significant price discovery  contract under Sec. 36.3(d)(4) within 90 calendar days of the date of  the Commission's order if the contract is the electronic trading  facility's first significant price discovery contract; or 30 days from  the date of the Commission's order if the contract is not the electronic  trading facility's first significant price discovery contract. Once the  Commission determines that a contract performs a significant price  discovery function, subsequent rule changes must be self-certified to  the Commission by the electronic trading facility pursuant to Sec. 40.6  of this chapter or submitted to the Commission for review and approval  pursuant to Sec. 40.5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices. Guideline No. 1, 17 CFR part 40, appendix  A may be used as guidance in meeting this core principle for significant  price discovery contracts.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE II--MONITORING OF TRADING. The electronic trading  facility shall monitor trading in significant price discovery contracts  to prevent market manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the  delivery of cash-settlement process through market surveillance,  compliance and disciplinary practices and procedures, including methods  for conducting real-time monitoring of trading and comprehensive and  accurate trade reconstructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. An electronic trading facility on which significant  price discovery contracts are traded or executed should, with respect to  those contracts, demonstrate a capacity to prevent market manipulation  and have trading and participation rules to detect and deter abuses. The  facility should seek to prevent market manipulation and other trading  abuses through a dedicated regulatory department or by delegation of  that function to an appropriate third party. An electronic trading  facility also should have the authority to intervene as necessary to  maintain an orderly market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An acceptable trade monitoring  program. An acceptable trade monitoring program should facilitate, on  both a routine and non-routine basis, arrangements and resources to  detect and deter abuses through direct surveillance of each significant  price discovery contract. Direct surveillance of each significant price  discovery contract will generally involve the collection of various  market data, including information on participants' market activity.  Those data should be evaluated on an ongoing basis in order to make an  appropriate regulatory response to potential market disruptions or  abusive practices. For contracts with a substantial number of  participants, an effective surveillance program should employ a much  more comprehensive large trader reporting system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authority to collect information and documents. The electronic  trading facility should have the authority to collect information and  documents in order to reconstruct trading for appropriate market  analysis. Appropriate market analysis should enable the electronic  trading facility to assess whether each significant price discovery  contract is responding to the forces of supply and demand. Appropriate  data usually include various fundamental data about the underlying  commodity, its supply, its demand, and its movement through market  channels. Especially important are data related to the size and  ownership of deliverable supplies--the existing supply and the future or  potential supply--and to the pricing of the deliverable commodity  relative to the futures price and relative to the similar, but non- deliverable, kinds of the commodity. For cash-settled contracts, it is  more appropriate to pay attention to the availability and pricing of the  commodity making up the index to which the contract will be settled, as  well as monitoring the continued suitability of the methodology for  deriving the index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ability to assess participants' market activity and power. To  assess participants' activity and potential power in a market,  electronic trading facilities, with respect to significant price  discovery contracts, at a minimum should have routine access to the  positions and trading of its participants and, if applicable, should  provide for such access through its agreements with its third-party  provider of clearing services.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE III--ABILITY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION. The electronic  trading facility shall establish and enforce rules that allow the  electronic trading facility to obtain any necessary information to  perform any of the functions set forth in this subparagraph, provide the  information to the Commission upon request, and have the capacity to  carry out such international information-sharing agreements as the  Commission may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. An electronic trading facility on which significant  price discovery contracts are traded or executed should, with respect to  those contracts, have the ability and authority to collect information  and documents on both a routine and non-routine basis, including the  examination of books and records kept by participants. This includes  having arrangements and resources for recording full data entry and  trade details and safely storing audit trail data. An electronic trading  facility should have systems sufficient to enable it to use the  information for purposes of assisting in the prevention of participant  and market abuses through reconstruction of trading and providing  evidence of any violations of the electronic trading facility's rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The goal of an audit trail is to  detect and deter market abuse. An effective contract audit trail should  capture and retain sufficient trade-related information to permit  electronic trading facility staff to detect trading abuses and to  reconstruct all transactions within a reasonable period of time. An  audit trail should include specialized electronic surveillance programs  that identify potentially abusive trades and trade patterns. An  acceptable audit trail must be able to track an order from time of entry  into the trading system through its fill. The electronic trading  facility must create and maintain an electronic transaction history  database that contains information with respect to transactions executed  on each significant price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An acceptable audit trail should include the following: original  source documents, transaction history, electronic analysis capability,  and safe storage capability. An acceptable audit trail system would  satisfy the following practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Original source documents. Original source documents include  unalterable, sequentially identified records on which trade execution  information is originally recorded. For each order (whether filled,  unfilled or cancelled, each of which should be retained or  electronically captured), such records reflect the terms of the order,  an account identifier that relates back to the account(s) owner(s), and  the time of order entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transaction history. A transaction history consists of an  electronic history of each transaction, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All the data that are input into the trade entry or matching  system for the transaction to match and clear;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Timing and sequencing data adequate to reconstruct trading; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The identification of each account to which fills are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Electronic analysis capability. An electronic analysis  capability permits sorting and presenting data included in the  transaction history so as to reconstruct trading and to identify  possible trading violations with respect to market abuse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Safe storage capability. Safe storage capability provides for a  method of storing the data included in the transaction history in a  manner that protects the data from unauthorized alteration, as well as  from accidental erasure or other loss. Data should be retained in the  form and manner specified by the Commission or, where no acceptable  manner of retention is specified, in accordance with the recordkeeping  standards of Sec. 1.31 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arrangements and resources for the disclosure of the obtained  information and documents to the Commission upon request. The electronic  trading facility should maintain records of all information and  documents related to each significant price discovery contract in a form  and manner acceptable to the Commission. Where no acceptable manner of  maintenance is specified, records should be maintained in accordance  with the recordkeeping standards of Sec. 1.31 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The capacity to carry out appropriate information-sharing  agreements as the Commission may require. Appropriate information- sharing agreements could be established with other markets or the  Commission can act in conjunction with the electronic trading facility  to carry out such information sharing.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE IV--POSITION LIMITATIONS OR ACCOUNTABILITY. The  electronic trading facility shall adopt, where necessary and  appropriate, position limitations or position accountability for  speculators in significant price discovery contracts, taking into  account positions in other agreements, contracts and transactions that  are treated by a derivatives clearing organization, whether registered  or not registered, as fungible with such significant price discovery  contracts to reduce the potential threat of market manipulation or  congestion, especially during trading in the delivery month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices for uncleared trades. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acceptable practices for cleared trades--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. In  order to diminish potential problems arising from excessively large  speculative positions, and to facilitate orderly liquidation of expiring  contracts, an electronic trading facility relying on the exemption set  forth in this section should adopt rules that set position limits or  accountability levels on traders' cleared positions in significant price  discovery contracts. These position limit rules specifically may exempt  bona fide hedging; permit other exemptions; or set limits differently by  market, delivery month or time period. For the purpose of evaluating a  significant price discovery contract's speculative-limit program for  cleared positions, the Commission will consider the specified position  limits or accountability   levels, aggregation policies, types of exemptions allowed, methods for  monitoring compliance with the specified limits or levels, and  procedures for dealing with violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accounting for cleared trades--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Speculative-limit levels  typically should be set in terms of a trader's combined position  involving cleared trades in a significant price discovery contract, plus  positions in agreements, contracts and transactions that are treated by  a derivatives clearing organization, whether registered or not  registered, as fungible with such significant price discovery contract.  (This circumstance typically exists where an exempt commercial market  lists a particular contract for trading but also allows for positions in  that contract to be cleared together with positions established through  bilateral or off-exchange transactions, such as block trades, in the  same contract. Essentially, both the on-facility and off-facility  transactions are considered fungible with each other.) In this  connection, the electronic trading facility should make arrangements to  ensure that it is able to ascertain accurate position data for the  market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For significant price discovery contracts that are traded on a  cleared basis, the electronic trading facility should apply position  limits to cleared transactions in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on spot-month positions. Spot-month limits should be  adopted for significant price discovery contracts to minimize the  susceptibility of the market to manipulation or price distortions,  including squeezes and corners or other abusive trading practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contracts economically equivalent to an existing contract. An  electronic trading facility that lists a significant price discovery  contract that is economically-equivalent to another significant price  discovery contract or to a contract traded on a designated contract  market should set the spot-month limit for its significant price  discovery contract at the same level as that specified for the  economically-equivalent contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contracts that are not economically equivalent to an existing  contract. There may not be an economically-equivalent significant price  discovery contract or economically-equivalent contract traded on a  designated contract market. In this case, the spot-month speculative  position limit should be established in the following manner. The spot- month limit for a physical delivery market should be based upon an  analysis of deliverable supplies and the history of spot-month  liquidations. The spot-month limit for a physical-delivery market is  appropriately set at no more than 25 percent of the estimated  deliverable supply. In the case where a significant price discovery  contract has a cash settlement provision, the spot-month limit should be  set at a level that minimizes the potential for price manipulation or  distortion in the significant price discovery contract itself; in  related futures and options contracts traded on a designated contract  market; in other significant price discovery contracts; in other  fungible agreements, contracts and transactions; and in the underlying  commodity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Position accountability for non-spot-month positions. The  electronic trading facility should establish for its significant price  discovery contracts non-spot individual month position accountability  levels and all-months-combined position accountability levels. An  electronic trading facility may establish non-spot individual month  position limits and all-months-combined position limits for its  significant price discovery contracts in lieu of position accountability  levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. Position accountability provisions provide a means  for an exchange to monitor traders' positions that may threaten orderly  trading. An acceptable accountability provision sets target  accountability threshold levels that may be exceeded, but once a trader  breaches such accountability levels, the electronic trading facility  should initiate an inquiry to determine whether the individual's trading  activity is justified and is not intended to manipulate the market. As  part of its investigation, the electronic trading facility may inquire  about the trader's rationale for holding a position in excess of the  accountability levels. An acceptable accountability provision should  provide the electronic trading facility with the authority to order the  trader not to further increase positions. If a trader fails to comply  with a request for information about positions held, provides  information that does not sufficiently justify the position, or  continues to increase contract positions after a request not to do so is  issued by the facility, then the accountability provision should enable  the electronic trading facility to require the trader to reduce  positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contracts economically equivalent to an existing contract. When  an electronic trading facility lists a significant price discovery  contract that is economically equivalent to another significant price  discovery contract or to a contract traded on a designated contract  market, the electronic trading facility should set the non-spot  individual month position accountability level and all-months-combined  position accountability level for its significant price discovery  contract at the same levels, or lower, as those specified for the  economically-equivalent contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contracts that are not economically equivalent to an existing  contract. For significant price discovery contracts that are not  economically equivalent to an existing contract, the trading facility  shall adopt non-spot individual month and all-months-combined position  accountability levels that are   no greater than 10 percent of the average combined futures and delta- adjusted option month-end open interest for the most recent calendar  year. For electronic trading facilities that choose to adopt non-spot  individual month and all-months-combined position limits in lieu of  position accountability levels for their significant price discovery  contracts, the limits should be set in the same manner as the  accountability levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Contracts economically equivalent to an existing contract with  position limits. If a significant price discovery contract is  economically equivalent to another significant price discovery contract  or to a contract traded on a designated contract market that has adopted  non-spot or all-months-combined position limits, the electronic trading  facility should set non-spot month position limits and all-months- combined position limits for its significant price discovery contract at  the same (or lower) levels as those specified for the economically- equivalent contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Account aggregation. An electronic trading facility should have  aggregation rules for significant price discovery contracts that apply  to accounts under common control, those with common ownership, i.e.,  where there is a ten percent or greater financial interest, and those  traded according to an express or implied agreement. Such aggregation  rules should apply to cleared transactions with respect to applicable  speculative position limits. An electronic trading facility will be  permitted to set more stringent aggregation policies. An electronic  trading facility may grant exemptions to its price discovery contracts'  position limits for bona fide hedging (as defined in Sec. 1.3(z) of  this chapter) and may grant exemptions for reduced risk positions, such  as spreads, straddles and arbitrage positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Implementation deadlines. An electronic trading facility with a  significant price discovery contract is required to comply with Core  Principle IV within 90 calendar days of the date of the Commission's  order determining that the contract performs a significant price  discovery function if such contract is the electronic trading facility's  first significant price discovery contract, or within 30 days of the  date of the Commission's order if such contract is not the electronic  trading facility's first significant price discovery contract. For the  purpose of applying limits on speculative positions in newly-determined  significant price discovery contracts, the Commission will permit a  grace period following issuance of its order for traders with cleared  positions in such contracts to become compliant with applicable position  limit rules. Traders who hold cleared positions on a net basis in the  electronic trading facility's significant price discovery contract must  be at or below the specified position limit level no later than 90  calendar days from the date of the electronic trading facility's  implementation of position limit rules, unless a hedge exemption is  granted by the electronic trading facility. This grace period applies to  both initial and subsequent price discovery contracts. Electronic  trading facilities should notify traders of this requirement promptly  upon implementation of such rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Enforcement provisions. The electronic trading facility should  have appropriate procedures in place to monitor its position limit and  accountability provisions and to address violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An electronic trading facility with significant price discovery  contracts should use an automated means of detecting traders' violations  of speculative limits or exemptions, particularly if the significant  price discovery contracts have large numbers of traders. An electronic  trading facility should monitor the continuing appropriateness of  approved exemptions by periodically reviewing each trader's basis for  exemption or requiring a reapplication. An automated system also should  be used to determine whether a trader has exceeded applicable non-spot  individual month position accountability levels and all-months-combined  position accountability levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An electronic trading facility should establish a program for  effective enforcement of position limits for significant price discovery  contracts. Electronic trading facilities should use a large trader  reporting system to monitor and enforce daily compliance with position  limit rules. The Commission notes that an electronic trading facility  may allow traders to periodically apply to the electronic trading  facility for an exemption and, if appropriate, be granted a position  level higher than the applicable speculative limit. The electronic  trading facility should establish a program to monitor approved  exemptions from the limits. The position levels granted under such hedge  exemptions generally should be based upon the trader's commercial  activity in related markets including, but not limited to, positions  held in related futures and options contracts listed for trading on  designated contract markets, fungible agreements, contracts and  transactions, as determined by a derivatives clearing organization.  Electronic trading facilities may allow a brief grace period where a  qualifying trader may exceed speculative limits or an existing exemption  level pending the submission and approval of appropriate justification.  An electronic trading facility should consider whether it wants to  restrict exemptions during the last several days of trading in a  delivery month. Acceptable procedures for obtaining and granting  exemptions include a requirement that the electronic trading facility  approve a specific maximum higher level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An acceptable speculative limit program should have specific  policies for taking   regulatory action once a violation of a position limit or exemption is  detected. The electronic trading facility policies should consider  appropriate actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Violation of Commission rules. A violation of position limits  for significant price discovery contracts that have been self-certified  by an electronic trading facility is also a violation of section 4a(e)  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE V--EMERGENCY AUTHORITY. The electronic trading  facility shall adopt rules to provide for the exercise of emergency  authority, in consultation or cooperation with the Commission, where  necessary and appropriate, including the authority to liquidate open  positions in significant price discovery contracts and to suspend or  curtail trading in a significant price discovery contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. An electronic trading facility on which significant  price discovery contracts are traded should have clear procedures and  guidelines for decision-making regarding emergency intervention in the  market, including procedures and guidelines to avoid conflicts of  interest while carrying out such decision-making. An electronic trading  facility on which significant price discovery contracts are executed or  traded should also have the authority to intervene as necessary to  maintain markets with fair and orderly trading as well as procedures for  carrying out the intervention. Procedures and guidelines should include  notifying the Commission of the exercise of the electronic trading  facility's regulatory emergency authority, explaining how conflicts of  interest are minimized, and documenting the electronic trading  facility's decision-making process and the reasons for using its  emergency action authority. Information on steps taken under such  procedures should be included in a submission of a certified rule and  any related submissions for rule approval pursuant to part 40 of this  chapter, when carried out pursuant to an electronic trading facility's  emergency authority. To address perceived market threats, the electronic  trading facility on which significant price discovery contracts are  executed or traded should, among other things, be able to impose  position limits in the delivery month, impose or modify price limits,  modify circuit breakers, call for additional margin either from market  participants or clearing members (for contracts that are cleared through  a clearinghouse), order the liquidation or transfer of open positions,  order the fixing of a settlement price, order a reduction in positions,  extend or shorten the expiration date or the trading hours, suspend or  curtail trading on the electronic trading facility, order the transfer  of contracts and the margin for such contracts from one market  participant to another, or alter the delivery terms or conditions or, if  applicable, should provide for such actions through its agreements with  its third-party provider of clearing services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE VI--DAILY PUBLICATION OF TRADING INFORMATION. The  electronic trading facility shall make public daily information on  price, trading volume, and other trading data to the extent appropriate  for significant price discovery contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. An electronic trading facility, with respect to  significant price discovery contracts, should provide to the public  information regarding settlement prices, price range, volume, open  interest, and other related market information for all applicable  contracts as determined by the Commission on a fair, equitable and  timely basis. Provision of information for any applicable contract can  be through such means as provision of the information to a financial  information service or by timely placement of the information on the  electronic trading facility's public Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices. Compliance with Sec. 16.01 of this  chapter, which is mandatory, is an acceptable practice that satisfies  the requirements of Core Principle VI.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE VII--COMPLIANCE WITH RULES.

The  arrangements and resources should facilitate the direct supervision of  the market and the analysis of data collected. Trade practice  surveillance programs may be carried out by the electronic trading  facility itself or through delegation or contracting-out to a third  party. If the electronic trading facility on which significant price  discovery contracts are executed or traded delegates or contracts-out  the trade practice surveillance responsibility to a third party, such  third party should have the capacity and authority to carry out such  programs, and the electronic trading facility should retain appropriate  supervisory authority over the third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An electronic trading facility on which significant price  discovery contracts are executed or traded should have arrangements,  resources and authority for effective rule enforcement. The Commission  believes that this should include the authority and ability to  discipline and limit or suspend the activities of a market participant  as well as the authority and ability to terminate the activities of a  market participant pursuant to   clear and fair standards. The electronic trading facility can satisfy  this criterion for market participants by expelling or denying such  person's future access upon a determination that such a person has  violated the electronic trading facility's rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices. An acceptable trade practice surveillance  program generally would include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance of data reflecting the details of each transaction  executed on the electronic trading facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Electronic analysis of this data routinely to detect potential  trading violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate and thorough investigative analysis of these and  other potential trading violations brought to the electronic trading  facility's attention; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prompt and effective disciplinary action for any violation that  is found to have been committed.

See, e.g., 17  CFR part 8.</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE VIII--CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. The electronic trading  facility on which significant price discovery contracts are executed or  traded shall establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of  interest in the decision-making process of the electronic trading  facility and establish a process for resolving such conflicts of  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The means to address conflicts of interest in the  decision-making of an electronic trading facility on which significant  price discovery contracts are executed or traded should include methods  to ascertain the presence of conflicts of interest and to make decisions  in the event of such a conflict. In addition, the Commission believes  that the electronic trading facility on which significant price  discovery contracts are executed or traded should provide for  appropriate limitations on the use or disclosure of material non-public  information gained through the performance of official duties by board  members, committee members and electronic trading facility employees or  gained through an ownership interest in the electronic trading facility  or its parent organization(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All electronic trading facilities on which significant price  discovery contracts are traded bear special responsibility to regulate  effectively, impartially, and with due consideration of the public  interest, as provided in section 3 of the Act. Under Core Principle  VIII, they are also required to minimize conflicts of interest in their  decision-making processes. To comply with this core principle,  electronic trading facilities on which significant price discovery  contracts are traded should be particularly vigilant for such conflicts  between and among any of their self-regulatory responsibilities, their  commercial interests, and the several interests of their management,  members, owners, market participants, other industry participants and  other constituencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">CORE PRINCIPLE IX--ANTITRUST CONSIDERATIONS. Unless necessary or  appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Act, the electronic trading  facility, with respect to any significant price discovery contracts,  shall endeavor to avoid adopting any rules or taking any actions that  result in any unreasonable restraints of trade or imposing any material  anticompetitive burden on trading on the electronic trading facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guidance. An electronic trading facility, with respect to a  significant price discovery contract, may at any time request that the  Commission consider under the provisions of section 15(b) of the Act any  of the electronic trading facility's rules, which may be trading  protocols or policies, operational rules, or terms or conditions of any  significant price discovery contract. The Commission intends to apply  section 15(b) of the Act to its consideration of issues under this core  principle in a manner consistent with that previously applied to  contract markets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable practices.
