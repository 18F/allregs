                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Information filing is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for filing carrier manifest. Carriers transporting  goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands to  foreign countries; from the United States or Puerto Rico to the U.S.  Virgin Islands; or between the United States and Puerto Rico may not be  granted clearance and may not depart until complete manifests or other  required documentation (for ocean, air, and rail carriers) have been  delivered to CBP Port Director in accordance with all applicable  requirements under CBP regulations. The CBP may require any document it  determines necessary to ensure compliance with U.S. export control laws,  such as: bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions,  manifest, train consist, or other commercial loading documents. The  required documents shall contain the appropriate AES proof of filing  citations, covering all cargo for which the EEI is required; or  exemption legends, covering cargo for which EEI need not be filed by the  regulations of this part. Such annotation shall be without material  change or amendment of proof of filing citations or exemption and  exclusion legends as   provided to the carrier by the USPPI or its authorized agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vessels. Vessels transporting goods as specified (except vessels  exempted by paragraph (a)(4) of this section) shall file a complete  manifest. Manifests may be filed via paper or electronically through the  AES Vessel Transportation Module as provided in CBP Regulations, 19 CFR  4.63 and 4.76.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bunker fuel. The manifest (including vessels taking bunker fuel  to be laden aboard vessels on the high seas) clearing for foreign  countries shall show the quantities and values of bunker fuel taken  aboard at that port for fueling use of the vessel, apart from such  quantities as may have been laden on vessels as cargo.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Coal and fuel oil. The quantity of coal shall be reported in  metric tons (1000 kgs or 2240 pounds), and the quantity of fuel oil  shall be reported in barrels of 158.98 liters (42 gallons). Fuel oil  shall be described in such manner as to identify diesel oil as  distinguished from other types of fuel oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aircraft. Aircraft transporting goods shall file a complete  manifest in accordance with all applicable requirements under CBP  regulations. The manifest shall be filed with the CBP Port Director at  the CBP port of exit. For shipments from the United States to Puerto  Rico, the manifests shall be filed with the CBP Port Director at the  port where the goods are unladen in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rail carriers. Rail carriers transporting goods shall file a car  manifest or train consist with CBP Port Director at the border port of  export in accordance with 19 CFR 123.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Carriers not required to file manifests. Carriers allowed to  file incomplete manifests under applicable CBP regulations are required,  upon request, to present to the CBP Port Director the proof of filing  citation, exemption or exclusion legends for each shipment, prior to  departure of the vessel, aircraft, train, truck or other means of  conveyance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Penalties. Failure of the carrier to file a manifest as required  constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part and renders such  carrier subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Partially exported shipments. Except as provided in paragraph  (c) of this section, when a carrier identifies, prior to filing the  manifest, that a portion of the goods covered by a single EEI  transaction has not been exported on the intended carrier, it shall be  noted on the manifest submitted to CBP. The carrier shall notify the  USPPI or the authorized agent of changes to the commodity data, and the  USPPI or the authorized agent shall electronically transmit the  corrections, cancellations, or amendments as soon as they are known in  accordance with Sec. 30.9. Failure by the carrier to correct the  manifest constitutes a violation of the provisions of the regulations in  this part and renders the carrier subject to the penalties provided for  in Subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Split shipments. When a shipment is divided by the carrier and  is covered by a single EEI transmission, the split shipment procedure  provided in Sec. 30.28 shall be followed by the carrier in delivering  manifests with the proof of filing citation or exemption legend to the  CBP Port Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attachment of commercial documents. The manifest shall carry a  notation that values stated are as presented on the bills of lading,  cargo lists, export shipping documents or other commercial documents.  The bills of lading, cargo lists, export shipping documents or other  commercial documents shall be securely attached to the manifest in such  a manner as to constitute one document and otherwise comply with CBP  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exempt items. For any item for which EEI is not required by the  regulations in this part, a notation on the manifest shall be made by  the carrier as to the basis for the exemption. In cases where a manifest  is not required and EEI is not required, an oral declaration to CBP Port  Director shall be made as to the basis for the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proof of filing citations and exemption legends. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as  noted in Sec. 30.4(b)(2), ocean, rail, truck and air exporting carriers  shall not load cargo that does not have all proof of filing citations,  exemption, exclusion legends, or postdeparture citations as provided for  in Appendix D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, ocean, rail, truck and air  exporting carriers are subject to the penalties provided for in subpart  H of this part if the exporting carrier;  [73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16381, Mar. 14, 2013]</p>
