When the arrangement is such that an employee in extra board, pool, or chain gang service gets the equivalent of full-time work, his lack of remuneration on any non-work day shall, subject to the provisions of Sec. 332.2(b), be considered as due solely to the application to him of a mileage or work restriction.</p>
