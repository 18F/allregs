                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of section 206 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 487) authorize the Administrator of General Services to establish and maintain a uniform Federal Catalog System to identify and classify personal property under the control of Federal agencies. Under this law each Federal agency is required to utilize the uniform Federal Catalog System, except as the Administrator of General Services shall otherwise provide, taking into consideration efficiency, economy, and other interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act (chapter 145, title 10, U.S. Code) authorizes the Secretary of Defense to develop a single supply catalog system for the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Both laws require that the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Defense shall coordinate the cataloging activities of GSA and the Department of Defense to avoid unnecessary duplication.
