                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. FAS allocates funds in a manner that effectively supports the strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. In deciding whether a proposed project will contribute to the effective creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets, FAS seeks to identify those projects that would demonstrate a clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy by market or product and a

program effectiveness time line against which results can be measured at specific intervals using quantifiable product or country or region goals. These performance indicators are part of FAS' resource allocation strategy to fund applicants which can demonstrate performance based on a long-term strategic plan and address the performance measurement objectives of the GPRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval criteria. FAS will consider a number of factors when reviewing proposed projects, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ability of the organization to provide an experienced U.S.-based staff with technical and international trade expertise to ensure adequate development, supervision, and execution of the proposed project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The organization's willingness to contribute resources, including cash and goods and services of the U.S. industry and foreign third parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The conditions or constraints affecting the level of U.S. exports and market share for the agricultural commodities and products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The degree to which the proposed project is likely to contribute to the creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The degree to which the strategic plan is coordinated with other private or U.S. government-funded market development projects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Past program results and evaluations, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Previous Cooperator program funding.</p>
