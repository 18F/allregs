This multitrack processing system does  not lessen agency responsibility to exercise due diligence in processing  requests in the most expeditious manner possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ERS shall process requests in each track on a ``first-in, first- out'' basis, unless there are unusual circumstances as set forth in  Sec. 1.16 of this title, or the requester is entitled to expedited  processing as set forth in Sec. 1.9 of this title.</p>
