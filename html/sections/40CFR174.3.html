                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in FIFRA. In  addition, the following terms have the meaning set forth in this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Active ingredient means a pesticidal substance that is intended to  be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and  the genetic material necessary for the production of such a pesticidal  substance.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States  Environmental Protection Agency or his/her delegate.</p><p class="depth0">Bridging crosses between plants means the utilization of an  intermediate plant in a cross to produce a viable zygote between the  intermediate plant and a first plant, in order to cross the plant  resulting from that zygote with a third plant that would not otherwise  be able to produce viable zygotes from the fusion of its gametes with  those of the first plant. The result of the bridging cross is the mixing  of genetic material of the first and third plant through the formation  of an intermediate zygote.</p><p class="depth0">Cell fusion means the fusion in vitro of two or more cells or  protoplasts.</p><p class="depth0">Conventional breeding of plants means the creation of progeny  through either: The union of gametes, i.e., syngamy, brought together  through processes such as pollination, including bridging crosses  between plants and wide crosses, or vegetative reproduction. It does not  include use of any of the following technologies: Recombinant DNA; other  techniques wherein the genetic material is extracted from an organism  and introduced into the genome of the recipient plant through, for  example, micro-injection, macro-injection, micro-encapsulation; or cell  fusion.</p><p class="depth0">EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0">Exudate means a substance gradually discharged or secreted across  intact cellular membranes or cell walls and present in the intercellular  spaces or on the exterior surfaces of the plant.</p><p class="depth0">FFDCA means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321  et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">FIFRA means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,  as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Food includes articles used for food or drink by humans or other  animals.</p><p class="depth0">Food plant means a plant which either in part or in toto, is used as  food.</p><p class="depth0">Genetic material necessary for the production means both: Genetic  material that encodes a substance or leads to the production of a  substance; and regulatory regions. It does not include noncoding,  nonexpressed nucleotide sequences.</p><p class="depth0">Genome means the sum of the heritable genetic material in the plant,  including genetic material in the nucleus and organelles.</p><p class="depth0">In a living plant means inside the living plant, on the surface of  the living plant, or as an exudate from the living plant.</p><p class="depth0">Inert ingredient, means any substance, such as a selectable marker,  other than the active ingredient, where the substance is used to confirm  or ensure the presence of the active ingredient, and includes the  genetic material necessary for the production of the substance, provided  that genetic material is intentionally introduced into a living plant in  addition to the active ingredient.</p><p class="depth0">Living plant means a plant, plant organ, or plant part that is  alive, viable, or dormant. Examples of plant parts include, but are not  limited to, seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and pollen.</p><p class="depth0">Noncoding, nonexpressed nucleotide sequences means the nucleotide  sequences are not transcribed and are not involved in gene expression.  Examples of noncoding, nonexpressed nucleotide sequences include, but  are not limited to, linkers, adapters, homopolymers, and sequences of  restriction enzyme recognition sites.</p><p class="depth0">Nucleic acids means ribosides or deoxyribosides of adenine, thymine,  guanine, cytosine, and uracil; polymers   of the deoxyribose-5'-monophosphates of thymine, cytosine, guanine, and  adenine linked by successive 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds (also known as  deoxyribonucleic acid); and polymers of the ribose-5'-monophosphates of  uracil, cytosine, guanine, and adenine linked by successive 3'-5'  phosphodiester bonds (also known as ribonucleic acid). The term does not  apply to nucleic acid analogues (e.g., dideoxycytidine), or polymers  containing nucleic acid analogues.</p><p class="depth0">Pesticidal substance, means a substance that is intended to be  produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, for a  pesticidal purpose, during any part of a plant's life cyle (e.g., in the  embryo, seed, seedling, mature plant).</p><p class="depth0">Plant, for plant-incorporated protectants, means an organism  classified using the 5-kingdom classification system of Whittaker in the  kingdom Plantae. This includes, but is not limited to, bryophytes such  as mosses, pteridophytes such as ferns, gymnosperms such as conifers,  and angiosperms such as most major crop plants.</p><p class="depth0">Plant-incorporated protectant means a pesticidal substance that is  intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce  thereof, and the genetic material necessary for production of such a  pesticidal substance. It also includes any inert ingredient contained in  the plant, or produce thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Produce thereof, when used with respect to plants containing plant-  incorporated protectants only, means a product of a living plant  containing a plant-incorporated protectant, where the pesticidal  substance is intended to serve a pesticidal purpose after the product  has been separated from the living plant. Examples of such products  include, but are not limited to, agricultural produce, grains, and  lumber. Products such as raw agricultural commodities bearing pesticide  chemical residues are not ``produce thereof'' when the residues are not  intended to serve a pesticidal purpose in the produce.</p><p class="depth0">Recipient plant means the living plant in which the plant- incorporated protectant is intended to be produced and used.</p><p class="depth0">Recombinant DNA means the genetic material has been manipulated in  vitro through the use of restriction endonucleases and/or other enzymes  that aid in modifying genetic material, and subsequently introduced into  the genome of the plant.</p><p class="depth0">Regulatory region means genetic material that controls the  expression of the genetic material that encodes a pesticidal substance  or leads to the production of a pesticidal substance. Examples of  regulatory regions include, but are not limited to, promoters,  enhancers, and terminators.</p><p class="depth0">Sexually compatible, when referring to plants, means a viable zygote  is formed only through the union of two gametes through conventional  breeding.</p><p class="depth0">Source means the donor of the genetic material that encodes a  pesticidal substance or leads to the production of a pesticidal  substance.</p><p class="depth0">Vegetative reproduction means either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> In seed plants, reproduction by apomixis, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> In other plants, reproduction by fragmentation, or division of  the somatic body.</p><p class="depth2">Wide crosses means to facilitate the formation of viable zygotes  through the use of surgical alteration of the plant pistil, bud  pollination, mentor pollen, immunosuppressants, in vitro fertilization,  pre-pollination and post-pollination hormone treatments, manipulation of  chromosome numbers, embryo culture, or ovary and ovule cultures.</p>
