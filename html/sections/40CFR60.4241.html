                                Sec. 60.4241  What are my compliance requirements if I am a   in the voluntary certification program or a manufacturer of equipment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">containing such engines?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers of stationary SI internal combustion engines with  a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) that do not use  gasoline and are not rich burn engines that use LPG can choose to  certify their engines to the emission standards in Sec. 60.4231(d) or  (e), as applicable, under the voluntary certification program described  in this subpart. Manufacturers who certify their engines under the  voluntary certification program must meet the requirements as specified  in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. In addition,  manufacturers of stationary SI internal combustion engines who choose to  certify their engines under the voluntary certification program, must  also meet the requirements as specified in Sec. 60.4247.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturers of engines other than those certified to standards  in 40 CFR part 90 or 40 CFR part 1054 must certify their stationary SI  ICE using the certification procedures required in 40 CFR part 1048,  subpart C, and must follow the same test procedures that apply to large  SI nonroad engines under 40 CFR part 1048, but must use the D-1 cycle of  International Organization of Standardization 8178-4: 1996(E)  (incorporated by reference, see 40 CFR 60.17) or the test cycle  requirements specified in Table 3 to 40 CFR 1048.505, except that Table  3 of 40 CFR 1048.505 applies to high load engines only. Stationary SI  internal combustion engine manufacturers who certify their stationary SI  ICE with a maximum engine power less than or equal to 30 KW (40 HP) with  a total displacement less than or equal to 1,000 cc to the certification  emission standards and other requirements for new nonroad SI engines in  40 CFR part 90 or 40 CFR part 1054, and manufacturers of emergency  engines that are greater than 25 HP and less than 130 HP who meet the  Phase 1 standards in 40 CFR 90.103, applicable to class II engines, must  certify their stationary SI ICE using the certification procedures  required in 40 CFR part 90, subpart B, or 40 CFR part 1054, subpart C,  as applicable, and must test their engines as specified in those parts.  Manufacturers of equipment containing stationary SI internal combustion  engines meeting the provisions of 40 CFR part 1054 must meet the  provisions of 40 CFR part 1060, subpart C, to the extent they apply to  equipment manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification of stationary SI ICE to the emission standards  specified in Sec. 60.4231(d) or (e), as applicable, is voluntary, but  manufacturers who decide to certify are subject to all of the  requirements indicated in this subpart with regard to the engines  included in   their certification. Manufacturers must clearly label their stationary  SI engines as certified or non-certified engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> or (e), as applicable, must certify their  engines for operation using fuel that meets the definition of pipeline- quality natural gas. The fuel used for certifying stationary SI natural  gas engines must meet the definition of pipeline-quality natural gas as  described in Sec. 60.4248. In addition, the manufacturer must provide  information to the owner and operator of the certified stationary SI  engine including the specifications of the pipeline-quality natural gas  to which the engine is certified and what adjustments the owner or  operator must make to the engine when installed in the field to ensure  compliance with the emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, as  applicable, must certify their engines for operation using fuel that  meets the specifications in 40 CFR 1065.720.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Manufacturers may certify their engines for operation using  gaseous fuels in addition to pipeline-quality natural gas; however, the  manufacturer must specify the properties of that fuel and provide  testing information showing that the engine will meet the emission  standards specified in Sec. 60.4231(d) or (e), as applicable, when  operating on that fuel. The manufacturer must also provide instructions  for configuring the stationary engine to meet the emission standards on  fuels that do not meet the pipeline-quality natural gas definition. The  manufacturer must also provide information to the owner and operator of  the certified stationary SI engine regarding the configuration that is  most conducive to reduced emissions where the engine will be operated on  gaseous fuels with different quality than the fuel that it was certified  to.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A stationary SI engine manufacturer may certify an engine family  solely to the standards applicable to landfill/digester gas engines as  specified in Sec. 60.4231(d) or (e), as applicable, but must certify  their engines for operation using landfill/digester gas and must add a  permanent label stating that the engine is for use only in landfill/ digester gas applications. The label must be added according to the  labeling requirements specified in 40 CFR 1048.135(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For purposes of this subpart, when calculating emissions of  volatile organic compounds, emissions of formaldehyde should not be  included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> For engines being certified to the voluntary certification  standards in Table 1 of this subpart, the VOC measurement shall be made  by following the procedures in 40 CFR 1065.260 and 1065.265 in order to  determine the total NMHC emissions by using a flame-ionization detector  and non-methane cutter. As an alternative to the nonmethane cutter,  manufacturers may use a gas chromatograph as allowed under 40 CFR  1065.267 and may measure ethane, as well as methane, for excluding such  levels from the total VOC measurement.
