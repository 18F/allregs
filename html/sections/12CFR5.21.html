                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, and 2901 et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Licensing requirements. A Federal mutual savings association must file an application, notice, or other filing as prescribed by this section when adopting or amending its charter or bylaws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section describes the procedures and requirements governing charters and bylaws for Federal mutual savings associations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, Sec. Sec. 5.8 through 5.11 shall not apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Charter form. Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a Federal mutual savings association shall have a charter in the following form. A charter for a Federal mutual savings bank shall substitute the term ``savings bank'' for ``association.'' The term ``trustee'' may be substituted for the term ``director.'' Associations adopting this charter with existing borrower members must grandfather those borrower members who were members as of the date of issuance of the new charter by the OCC. Such borrowers shall have one vote for the period of time such borrowings are in existence.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Mutual Charter</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Corporate title. The full corporate title of the Federal savings association is ------.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Office. The home office shall be located in ------ [city, state].</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Duration. The duration of the association is perpetual.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Purpose and powers. The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal mutual savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'').</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Capital. The association may raise capital by accepting payments on savings and demand accounts and by any other means authorized by the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Members. All holders of the association's savings, demand, or other authorized accounts are members of the association. In the consideration of all questions requiring action by the members of the association, each holder of an account shall be permitted to cast one vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the member's account. No member, however, shall cast more than 1,000 votes. All accounts shall be nonassessable.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7. Directors. The association shall be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen persons, as fixed in the association's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">Section 8. Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings. The association shall maintain for the purpose of meeting losses the amount of capital required by section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and by regulations of the OCC. The association shall distribute net earnings on its accounts on such basis and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may from time to time be authorized by the OCC: Provided, That the association may establish minimum-balance requirements for accounts to be eligible for distribution of

earnings. All holders of accounts of the association shall be entitled to equal distribution of assets, pro rata to the value of their accounts, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Moreover, in any such event, or in any other situation in which the priority of such accounts is in controversy, all such accounts shall, to the extent of their withdrawal value, be debts of the association having the same priority as the claims of general creditors of the association not having priority (other than any priority arising or resulting from consensual subordination) over other general creditors of the association.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9. Amendment of charter. Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment shall be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by the members at a legal meeting. Any other amendment, addition, change, or repeal of this charter must be approved by the OCC prior to approval by the members at a legal meeting, and shall be effective upon filing with the OCC in accordance with regulatory procedures.

A Federal mutual savings association may amend its charter by substituting any number of votes per member between 1 and 1000 in section 6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reissuance of charter. A Federal mutual savings association that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the OCC. Such request for reissuance should be filed at the appropriate OCC licensing office and contain signatures required under paragraph (e) of this section, together with such supporting documents as may be needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Availability of chartering documents. A Federal mutual savings association shall cause a true copy of its charter and bylaws and all amendments thereto to be available to accountholders at all times in each office of the savings association, and shall upon request deliver to any accountholders a copy of such charter and bylaws or amendments thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Bylaws for Federal mutual savings associations--(1) In general. A Federal mutual savings association shall operate under bylaws that contain provisions that comply with all requirements specified by the OCC in this paragraph and that are not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, the association's charter, and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations provided that, a bylaw provision inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph may be adopted with the approval of the OCC. Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the votes cast by the members at a legal meeting or a majority of the association's board of directors. The bylaws for a Federal mutual savings bank shall substitute the term ``savings bank'' for ``association''. The term ``trustee'' may be substituted for the term ``director''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. The following requirements are applicable to Federal mutual savings associations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual meetings of members. (A) An association shall provide for and conduct an annual meeting of its members for the election of directors and at which any other business of the association may be conducted. Such meeting shall be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate, and at a date and time within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At each annual meeting, the officers shall make a full report of the financial condition of the association and of its progress for the preceding year and shall outline a program for the succeeding year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special meetings of members. Procedures for calling any special meeting of the members and for conducting such a meeting shall be set forth in the bylaws. The board of directors of the association or the holders of 10 percent or more of the voting capital shall be entitled to call a special meeting. For purposes of this paragraph, ``voting capital'' means FDIC-insured deposits as of the voting record date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notice of meeting of members. Notice specifying the date, time, and place of the annual or any special meeting and adequately describing any

business to be conducted shall be published for two successive weeks immediately prior to the week in which such meeting shall convene in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or county in which the principal place of business of the association is located, or mailed postage prepaid at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the date on which such meeting shall convene to each of its members of record. A similar notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each of the offices of the association during the 14 days immediately preceding the date on which such meeting shall convene. The bylaws may permit a member to waive in writing any right to receive personal delivery of the notice. When any meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjournment and reconvening of the meeting shall be given as in the case of the original meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fixing of record date. The bylaws shall provide for the fixing of a record date and a method for determining from the books of the association the members entitled to vote. Such date shall be not more than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. The same determination shall apply to any adjourned meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Member quorum. Any number of members present and voting, represented in person or by proxy, at a regular or special meeting of the members shall constitute a quorum. A majority of all votes cast at any meeting of the members shall determine any question, unless otherwise required by regulation. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Members present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Voting by proxy. Procedures shall be established for voting at any annual or special meeting of the members by proxy pursuant to the rules and regulations of the OCC. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the member. All proxies with a term greater than eleven months or solicited at the expense of the association must run to the board of directors as a whole, or to a committee appointed by a majority of such board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Communications between members. Provisions relating to communications between members shall be consistent with Sec. 144.8 of this chapter. No member, however, shall have the right to inspect or copy any portion of any books or records of a Federal mutual savings association containing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A list of depositors in or borrowers from such association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Their addresses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Individual deposit or loan balances or records; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any data from which such information could be reasonably constructed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Number of directors, membership. The bylaws shall set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors shall be not fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OCC. Each director of the association shall be a member of the association. Directors may be elected for periods of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified, but if a staggered board is chosen, provision shall be made for the election of approximately one-third or one-half of the board each year, as appropriate. State-chartered savings banks converting to Federal savings banks may include alternative provisions for the election and term of office of directors so long as such provisions are authorized by the OCC, and provide for compliance with the standard provisions of this paragraph no later than six years after the conversion to a Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Meetings of the board. The board of directors shall determine the place, frequency, time, procedure for notice, which shall be at least 24 hours unless waived by the directors, and waiver of notice for all regular and special meetings. The board also may permit telephonic or electronic participation at meetings. The bylaws may provide for action to be taken without a meeting if unanimous written consent is obtained for such action. A majority of the authorized directors shall constitute a

quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Officers, employees and agents. (A) The bylaws shall contain provisions regarding the officers of the association, their functions, duties, and powers. The officers of the association shall consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom shall be elected annually by the board of directors. Such other officers and assistant officers and agents as may be deemed necessary may be elected or appointed by the board of directors or chosen in such other manner as may be prescribed in the bylaws. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person, except the offices of president and secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any officer may be removed by the board of directors with or without cause, but such removal, other than for cause, shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. Termination for cause, for purposes of this Sec. Sec. 5.21 and 5.22, shall include termination because of the person's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order, or material breach of any provision of an employment contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Vacancies, resignation or removal of directors. In the event of a vacancy on the board, the board of directors may, by their affirmative vote, fill such vacancy, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve only until the next election of directors by the members. The bylaws shall set out the procedure for the resignation of a director. Directors may be removed only for cause, as defined in Sec. 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Powers of the board. The board of directors shall have the power to exercise any and all of the powers of the association not expressly reserved by the charter to the members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Nominations for directors. The bylaws shall provide that nominations for directors may be made at the annual meeting by any member and shall be voted upon, except, however, the bylaws may require that nominations by a member must be submitted to the secretary and then prominently posted in the principal place of business, at least 10 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. However, if such provision is made for prior submission of nominations by a member, then the bylaws must provide for a nominating committee, which, except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity, must submit nominations to the secretary and have such nominations similarly posted at least 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> New business. The bylaws shall provide procedures for the introduction of new business at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Amendment. Bylaws may include any provision for their amendment that would be consistent with applicable law, rules, and regulations and adequately addresses its subject and purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Amendments shall be effective:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After approval by a majority vote of the authorized board, or by a majority of the vote cast by the members of the association at a legal meeting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After receipt of any applicable regulatory approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When an association fails to meet its quorum requirement, solely due to vacancies on the board, the bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of a majority of the sitting board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Miscellaneous. The bylaws may also address any other subjects necessary or appropriate for effective operation of the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form of filing--(i) Application requirement. (A) Any bylaw amendment shall be submitted to the appropriate OCC licensing office for OCC approval if it would render more difficult or discourage a merger, proxy contest, the assumption of control by a mutual account holder of the association, or the

removal of incumbent management; involve a significant issue of law or policy, including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or officer liability; or be inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph or with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or the association's charter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, bylaw provisions that adopt the language of the OCC's model or optional bylaws, if adopted without change, and filed with the OCC within 30 days after adoption, are effective upon adoption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing requirement. If the proposed bylaw amendment does not involve a provision that would be covered by paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section, then the association shall submit the amendment to the appropriate OCC licensing office at least 30 days prior to the date the bylaw amendment is to be adopted by the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Corporate governance procedures. A Federal mutual association may elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of the laws of the state where the main office of the institution is located, provided that such procedures may be elected only to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and safety and soundness, and such procedures are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal mutual association shall designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body of law selected for its corporate governance procedures, and shall file a copy of such bylaws, which are effective upon adoption, within 30 days after adoption. The submission shall indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effectiveness. Any bylaw amendment filed pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section shall automatically be effective 30 days from the date of filing of such amendment, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting such amendment. This automatic effective date does not apply if, prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, the OCC notifies the association that such amendment is rejected or that such amendment requires an application to be filed pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of subsequent charter or bylaw change. Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal mutual savings association to engage in any transaction shall be determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect.
