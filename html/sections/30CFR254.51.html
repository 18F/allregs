                            <p class="depth0">You may modify an existing response plan covering a lease or facility on the OCS to include a lease or facility in State waters located seaward of the coast line. Since this plan would cover more than one lease or facility, it would be considered a Regional Response Plan. You should refer to Sec.  254.3 and contact the appropriate regional BSEE office if you have any questions on how to prepare this Regional Response Plan.</p>
