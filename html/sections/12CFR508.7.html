Thereafter, the record shall be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Following the introduction of all evidence, the petitioner and the representative of the Office of Enforcement shall have an opportunity for oral argument; however, the parties may jointly waive the right to oral argument, and, in lieu thereof, elect to submit written argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All oral testimony and oral argument shall be recorded, and transcripts made available to the petitioner upon payment of the cost thereof. A copy of the transcript shall be sent directly to the presiding officer, who shall have

authority to correct the record sua sponte or upon the motion of any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The parties may, in writing, jointly waive an oral hearing and instead elect a hearing upon a written record in which all evidence and argument would be submitted to the presiding officer in documentary form and statements of individuals would be made by affidavit.
