The apportioned package bid on a license is an estimate of the price of an individual license included in a package of licenses in an auction with combinatorial (package) bidding. Apportioned package bids shall be determined by the Commission according to a methodology it establishes in advance of each auction with combinatorial bidding. The apportioned package bid on a license included in a package shall be used in place of the amount of an individual bid on that license when the bid amount is needed to determine the size of a designated entity bidding credit (see Sec. 1.2110(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(4)), a new entrant bidding credit (see Sec. 73.5007 of this chapter), a bid withdrawal or default payment obligation (see Sec. 1.2104(g)), a tribal land bidding credit limit (see Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)), or a size-based bidding credit unjust enrichment payment obligation (see Sec. 1.2111(b), (c)(2) and (c)(3)), or for any other determination required by the Commission's rules or procedures.</p>
