If the option described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is used, a pressure leak check is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calibration of all analyzers (see Secs. 92.119 through 92.122).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Check of the analysis system response time (see paragraph (c) of this section). If the option described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used, a response time check is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Leak checks--(1) Vacuum side leak check. (i) Any location within the analysis system where a vacuum leak could affect the test results must be checked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side is 0.5 percent of the in-use flow rate for the portion of the system being checked. the analyzer flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the in-use flow rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and valve V2 may be excluded from the leak check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pressure side leak check. (i) The maximum allowable leakage rate on the pressure side in 5 percent of the in-use flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Option: If the flow rate for each flow meter is equal to or greater than the flow rate recorded in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then a pressure side leak check is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> System response time; check procedure. (1) After any major change in the system, check the system response time by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stabilize the operating temperature of the sample line, sample pump, and heated filters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Introduce an HC span gas into the sampling system at the sample probe or valve V2 at atmospheric pressure. Simultaneously, start the time measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the HC instrument response is 95 percent of the span gas concentration used, stop the time measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the elapsed time is more than 20.0 seconds, make necessary adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Repeat with the CO, CO2, and NOX instruments and span gases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Option. If the following parameters are determined, the initial system response time may be generally applied to future checks:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Analyzer and bypass flow rates. (A) Determine by experimentation the minimum analyzer and bypass flow rates individually and in combination that will produce a response time as close as possible to 20.0 seconds per paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Record the highest minimum flow rate for each flow meter as determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capillary flow analyzers. This procedure is applicable only to analyzers that have sample capillaries such as the HFID and CL analyzers. It is also assumed that the system has sample/span valves that perform the function of valves V9 and V13 in.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Operate the analyzer(s) at the in-use capillary pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjust the bypass flow rate to the flow rate recorded in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Measure and record the response time from the sample/span valve(s) per paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The response time required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section can be determined by switching from the ``sample'' position to the ``span'' position of the sample/span valve and observing the analyzer response on a chart recorder. Normally, the ``sample'' position would select a ``room air'' sample and the ``span'' position would select a span gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Adjust the bypass flow rate to the normal in-use value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Measure and record the response time from the sample/span valve(s) per paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Determine the slowest response time (step in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section or step in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section) and add 2 seconds to it.</p>
