                                Sec. 416.641  Who is liable if your representative payee misuses
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A representative payee who misuses your benefits is responsible  for paying back misused benefits. We will make every reasonable effort  to obtain restitution of misused benefits so that we can repay these  benefits to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether or not we have obtained restitution from the misuser, we  will repay benefits in cases when we determine that a representative  payee misused benefits and the representative payee is an organization  or an individual payee serving 15 or more beneficiaries. When we make  restitution, we will pay you or your alternative representative payee an  amount equal to the misused benefits less any amount we collected from  the misuser and repaid to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether or not we have obtained restitution form the misuser, we  will repay benefits in cases when we determine that an individual  representative payee serving 14 or fewer beneficiaries misused benefits  and our negligent failure in the investigation or monitoring of that  representative payee results in the misuse. When we make restitution, we  will pay you or your alternative representative payee an amount equal to  the misused benefits less any amount we collected from the misuser and  repaid to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term ``negligent failure'' used in this subpart means that  we failed to investigate or monitor a representative payee or that we  did investigate or monitor a representative payee but did not follow  established procedures in our investigation or monitoring. Examples of  our negligent failure include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We did not follow our established procedures in this subpart  when investigating, appointing, or monitoring a representative payee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We did not investigate timely a reported allegation of misuse;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We did not take the steps necessary to prevent the issuance of  payments to the representative payee after it was determined that the  payee misused benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Our repayment of misused benefits under these provisions does  not alter the representative payee's liability and responsibility as  described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any amounts that the representative payee misuses and does not  refund will be treated as an overpayment to that representative payee.  See subpart E of this part.  [69 FR 60239, Oct. 7, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 61409, Oct. 18, 2006]</p>
