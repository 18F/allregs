An operating month, as defined in Sec.  63.2872, is any calendar month in which a source processes a listed  oilseed, excluding any entire calendar month in which the source  operated under an initial startup period subject to Sec. 63.2850(c)(2)  or (d)(2) or a malfunction period subject to Sec. 63.2850(e)(2).  Equation 1 of this section follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12AP01.001</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equation 1 of this section can also be expressed as a function  of total solvent loss as shown in Equation 2 of this section.
