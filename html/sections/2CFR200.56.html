                                Sec. 200.56  Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A;)) costs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Indirect (F&A;) costs means those costs incurred for a common or  joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily  assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without  effort disproportionate to the results achieved. To facilitate equitable  distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may  be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect (F&A;) costs.  Indirect (F&A;) cost pools must be distributed to benefitted cost  objectives on bases that will produce an equitable result in  consideration of relative benefits derived.
