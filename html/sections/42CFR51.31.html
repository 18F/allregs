The P&A; system shall not implement a  policy or practice restricting the remedies which may be sought on  behalf of individuals with mental illness or compromising the authority  of the P&A; system to pursue such remedies through litigation, legal  action or other forms of advocacy. However, this requirement does not  prevent the P&A; system from placing limitations on case or client  acceptance criteria developed as part of the annual priorities.  Prospective clients must be informed of any such limitations at the time  they request service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wherever possible, the program should establish an ongoing  presence in residential mental health care or treatment facilities, and  relevant hospital units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Program activities should be carried out in a manner which  allows program staff to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interact regularly with those individuals who are current or  potential recipients of protection and advocacy services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interact regularly with staff providing care or treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtain information and review records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Communicate with family members, social and community service  workers and others involved in providing care or treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A P&A; system may support or provide training, including related   travel expenses, for individuals with mental illness, family members of  such individuals, and other persons who are not program staff,  contractors, or board or council members, to increase knowledge about  protection and advocacy issues, to enhance leadership capabilities, or  to promote Federal-State and intra-State cooperation on matter related  to mental health system improvement. Decisions concerning the selection  of individuals to receive such training shall be made in accordance with  established policies, procedures and priorities of the P&A; system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A P&A; system may monitor, evaluate and comment on the  development and implementation of Federal, State and local laws,  regulations, plans, budgets, levies, projects, policies and hearings  affecting individuals with mental illness as a part of federally funded  advocacy activities.
