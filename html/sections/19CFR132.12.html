                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preliminary review before opening. When it is anticipated that a quota will be filled at the opening of the quota period, entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, with estimated duties attached, shall not be presented before 12 noon Eastern Standard Time in all time zones. However, an entry summary for consumption, or withdrawal for consumption, for merchandise which has arrived within the Customs territory of the United States may be submitted for preliminary review without deposit of estimated duties within a time period before the opening approved by the port director. Submission of these documents before opening will not accord the merchandise quota priority or status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Simultaneous presentation. Special arrangements shall be made so that all entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, for quota merchandise may be presented at the exact moment of the opening of the quota in all time zones. All importers prepared to present entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, when the quota opens shall be given equal opportunity to do so. All entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, presented in proper form (including those submitted for review before opening of the quota period if accompanied by the deposit of estimated duties) shall be considered to have been presented simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proration of quantities. (1) The quantities on all entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, submitted simultaneously shall be prorated by Headquarters against the quota quantity admissible to determine the percentage to be allocated to each importer under the quota. Merchandise in excess of the quota shall be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 132.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The quantities on all entry summaries for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, submitted simultaneously shall be prorated by Headquarters against the quota quantity admissible to determine the percentage to be allocated to each importer under the quota.

The time of presentation for quota purposes, in that event, shall be the exact moment of the opening of the quota provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An adjusted entry summary for consumption, or withdrawal for consumption, with estimated duties attached, is deposited within 5 working days after Headquarters authorizes release of the merchandise, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The importer takes delivery of the merchandise within 15 working days after release is authorized.
