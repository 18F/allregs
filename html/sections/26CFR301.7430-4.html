                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a))</em> and  incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in  Sec. 301.7430-3(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Costs described--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The costs described in this  paragraph are the reasonable and necessary amount of costs incurred by  the taxpayer to present the taxpayer's position with respect to the  merits of the tax controversy or the recovery of reasonable  administrative costs. These costs include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any administrative fees or similar charges imposed by the  Internal Revenue Service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reasonable expenses of expert witnesses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable costs of any study, analysis, engineering report,  test or project that is necessary for, and incurred in preparation of,  the taxpayer's case; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of a  representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) in  connection with the administrative proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Representative and specially qualified representative--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Representative. A representative is a person compensated for services  rendered in connection with the administrative proceeding, who is  authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax  Court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, a specially qualified  representative is a representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of  this section) possessing a distinctive knowledge or a unique and  specialized skill that is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer  in the proceeding. Examples of a unique and specialized skill or  distinctive knowledge would be an identifiable practice specialty such  as patent law or knowledge of a foreign law or language where such  specialty or knowledge is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer  in the proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, neither knowledge of  tax law nor experience in representing taxpayers before the Internal  Revenue Service is considered distinctive knowledge or a unique and  specialized skill. An extraordinary level of general representational  knowledge and ability that is useful in all proceedings is not  considered, in and of itself, distinctive knowledge or a unique and  specialized skill. Specially qualified representatives also do not  include those who have a distinctive knowledge of the underlying subject  matter of the controversy in circumstances where such distinctive  knowledge could reasonably be supplied through the use of an expert, or  could readily be obtained through literature pertaining to the subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on fees for a representative--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except  as otherwise provided in this section, fees described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv) of this section that are recoverable under section 7430 and  the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may not  exceed, in the case of proceedings commenced after July 30, 1996, $110  per hour increased by a cost of living adjustment (and if appropriate, a  special factor adjustment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost of living adjustment. The Internal Revenue Service will  make a cost of living adjustment to the $110 per hour limitation for  fees incurred in any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1996.  The cost of living adjustment will be an amount equal to $110 multiplied  by the cost of living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for  the calendar year (substituting ``calendar year 1995'' for ``calendar  year 1992'' in section 1(f)(3)(B)). If the dollar limitation as adjusted  by this cost of living increase is not a multiple of $10, the dollar  amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 (rounding up if  the amount is a multiple of $5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Percentage adjustment. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A)  of this section, the base year for determining the cost of living  adjustment is the calendar year 1986. The cost of living adjustment for  fees incurred in any calendar year subsequent to 1986 is the percentage  (if any) by which the yearly average CPI--U for the calendar year  immediately prior to the year in which the fees are incurred exceeds the  January CPI--U for the calendar year 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special factor adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If the presence of  a special factor is demonstrated by the taxpayer, the amount  reimbursable is the amount of reasonable fees paid or incurred by the  taxpayer in connection with the proceeding for the services of a  representative as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(iii)</em>. The novelty and  difficulty of the issues, the undesirability of the case, the work and  the ability of counsel, the results obtained, and customary fees and  awards in other cases, are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of  litigation and do not constitute special factors for the purpose of  increasing the $110 per hour limitation. The limited availability of a  specially qualified representative for the proceeding does constitute a  special factor justifying an increase in the $110 per hour limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limited availability. Unless disputed by the Internal Revenue  Service, limited availability of a specially qualified representative is  established by demonstrating that a specially qualified representative  for the proceeding is not available at the $110 per hour rate (as  adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). Initially, this showing  may be made by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by  the taxpayer's counsel, that in a   case similar to the taxpayer's, a specially qualified representative  that practices within a reasonable distance from the taxpayer's  principal residence or principal office would normally charge a client  similar to the taxpayer at a rate in excess of this amount. If the  Internal Revenue Service challenges this initial showing, the taxpayer  may submit additional evidence to establish the limited availability of  a specially qualified representative at the rate specified above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Example. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer A is represented by B, a CPA and attorney with an  LL.M. Degree in Taxation with Highest Honors and who regularly handles  cases dealing with TEFRA partnership issues. B represents A in an  administrative proceeding involving TEFRA partnership issues and subject  to the provisions of this section. Assuming the taxpayer qualifies for  an award of reasonable administrative costs by meeting the requirements  of section 7430, the amount of the award attributable to the fees of B  may not exceed the $110 per hour limitation (as adjusted for the cost of  living), absent a special factor. Under these facts alone, B is not a  specially qualified representative since even extraordinary knowledge of  the tax laws does not constitute distinctive knowledge or a unique and  specialized skill constituting a special factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certain costs excluded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs not incurred in an  administrative proceeding. Costs that are not reasonable administrative  costs for purposes of section 7430 include any costs incurred in  connection with a proceeding that is not an administrative proceeding  within the meaning of Sec. 301.7430-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding but not  reasonable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Costs incurred in an administrative  proceeding that are incurred on or after the administrative proceeding  date, and that are otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section,  are not recoverable unless they are reasonable in both nature and  amount. For example, costs normally included in the hourly rate of the  representative by the custom and usage of the representative's  profession, when billed separately, are not recoverable separate and  apart from the representative's hourly rate. Such costs typically  include costs such as secretarial and overhead expenses. In contrast,  costs which are normally billed separately may be reasonable  administrative costs that may be recoverable in addition to the  representative's hourly rate. Therefore, necessary costs incurred for  travel; expedited mail delivery; messenger service; expenses while on  travel; long distance telephone calls; and necessary copying fees  imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, any court, bank or other third  party, when normally billed separately from the representative's hourly  rate, may be reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special Rule for Expert Witness' Fees on Issue of Prevailing  Market Rates. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the  taxpayer may initially establish a limited availability of specially  qualified representatives for the proceeding by submission of an  affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's representative.  The Internal Revenue Service may endeavor to rebut the affidavit  submitted on this issue by demonstrating either that a specially  qualified representative was not necessary to represent the taxpayer in  the proceeding, that the taxpayer's representative is not a specially  qualified representative or that the prevailing rate for specially  qualified representatives does not exceed $110 per hour (as adjusted for  an increase in the cost of living). Unless the Internal Revenue Service  endeavors to demonstrate that the prevailing rate for specially  qualified representatives does not exceed $110 per hour (as adjusted for  an increase in the cost of living), fees for expert witnesses used to  establish prevailing market rates are not included in the term  reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Litigation costs. Litigation costs are not reasonable  administrative costs because they are not incurred in connection with an  administrative proceeding. Litigation costs include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of  a petition with the United States Tax Court or in connection with the  commencement of any other court proceeding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Costs incurred after the filing of a petition with the United  States Tax   Court or after the commencement of any other court proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30- day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office  conference. At the conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters  at issue. The Internal Revenue Service then issues a notice of  deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A discontinues A's  administrative efforts and files a petition with the Tax Court. A's  costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a  petition with the Tax Court are litigation costs and not reasonable  administrative costs. Furthermore, A's costs incurred before the  administrative proceeding date (date of the notice of deficiency as set  forth in Sec. 301.7430-3(c)(3)), are not reasonable administrative  costs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that after A  receives the notice of deficiency, A recontacts Appeals. Again, A's  costs incurred before the administrative proceeding date, the date of  the notice of deficiency as set forth in Sec. 301.7430-3(c)(3), are not  reasonable administrative costs. A's costs incurred in recontacting and  working with Appeals after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, and  up to and including the time of filing of the petition, are reasonable  administrative costs. A's costs incurred in connection with the filing  of a petition with the Tax Court are not reasonable administrative costs  because those costs are litigation costs. Similarly, A's costs incurred  after the filing of the petition are not reasonable administrative  costs, as those are litigation costs.
