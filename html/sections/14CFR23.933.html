Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this type of failure is extremely remote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each system must have a means to prevent the engine from producing

more than idle thrust when the reversing system malfunctions; except that it may produce any greater thrust that is shown to allow directional control to be maintained, with aerodynamic means alone, under the most critical reversing condition expected in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For propeller reversing systems.

Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this type of failure is extremely remote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each system must be designed so that no single failure, likely combination of failures or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust under any operating condition. Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this type of failure is extremely remote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be shown by failure analysis, or testing, or both, for propeller systems that allow the propeller blades to move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is substantially less than the normal flight, low-pitch position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made to show compliance with Sec. 35.21 for the type certification of the propeller and associated installation components. Credit will be given for pertinent analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller manufacturers.
