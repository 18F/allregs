For external dosimeter  measurements, this includes an evaluation of the dosimeter response to  the radiation types (gamma, x-ray, neutron, beta, or other charged  particle) and the associated energy spectrum. For internal exposure, the  methods used to analyze bioassay samples will be reviewed to determine  their ability to detect the radionuclides present in the work  environment. An analysis of the monitoring or exchange frequencies for  the monitoring programs will also be conducted to determine the  potential for undetected dose.</p>
