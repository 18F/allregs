Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. The ONRR may require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as well as when the contract was executed.</p><p class="depth2">Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.</p><p class="depth2">BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.</p><p class="depth2">Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal.

Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation.
