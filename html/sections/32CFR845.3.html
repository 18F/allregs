                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for provision of counsel, provision of bail, or payment  of expenses will ordinarily be made by the defendant or accused through  appropriate channels to the officer exercising general court-martial  jurisdiction over him. This officer shall determine whether the request  meets the criteria prescribed herein and, based upon such determination,  shall take final action approving or disapproving the request. Within  their geographical areas of responsibility, major commands in the  interest of obtaining prompt and effective legal service may appoint as  approval authority, instead of the officer exercising general court- martial jurisdiction, any subordinate officer having responsibility in a  particular country for personnel subject to foreign criminal  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the criteria prescribed below, an officer  exercising approved authority may, in his discretion, deny a request for  the provision of counsel, provision of bail or payment of expenses,  where the otherwise eligible requestor is in an absent without leave or  deserter status at the time of the request, or otherwise is not then  subject to United States military control, and there is no reasonable  basis for the belief that the requestor will return to United States  military control at the conclusion of the proceedings of service of an  adjudged sentence, if any.</p>
