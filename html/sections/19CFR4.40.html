Parts of the hull and fittings recovered from a vessel which arrived in the United States in the course of navigation and was wrecked in the waters of the United States or was dismantled in this country are free of duties and import taxes, but if such articles are recovered from vessels outside the waters of the United States and brought into a United States port, they shall be treated as imported merchandise.</p>
