The FDIC may request additional  information at any time during processing of the filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Processing. The FDIC will provide the applicant with written  notification of the final action as soon as the decision is rendered.  [67 FR 79247, Dec. 27, 2002. Redesignated at 71 FR 20526, Apr. 21, 2006]</p>
