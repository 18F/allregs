                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the procedures for motor vehicle  manufacturers and NHTSA to follow in the determination of whether any  light duty truck lines that have or are likely to have a low theft rate  have major parts interchangeable with a majority of the covered major  parts of a passenger motor vehicle line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. These procedures apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each manufacturer that produces--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least one passenger motor vehicle line identified in 49 CFR  541.3(a)(1) and (2) that has been or will be introduced into commerce in  the United States, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one light duty truck line that has been or will be  introduced into commerce in the United States and that the manufacturer  identifies as likely to have a theft rate below the median theft rate;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each of those likely sub-median theft rate light duty truck  lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each light duty truck line that a  manufacturer identifies under appendix C of part 541 of this chapter as  having or likely to have a theft rate below the median rate, the  manufacturer identifies how many and which of the major parts of that  line will be interchangeable with the covered major parts of any of its  passenger motor vehicle lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the manufacturer concludes that a light duty truck line that  has or is likely to have a theft rate below the median theft rate has  major parts that are interchangeable with a majority of the covered  major parts of a passenger motor vehicle line, the manufacturer  determines whether all the vehicles of those lines with sub-median or  likely sub-median theft rates will account for more than 90 percent of  the total annual production of all of the manufacturer's lines with  those interchangeable parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer submits its evaluations and conclusions made  under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, together with the  underlying factual information, to NHTSA not less than 15 months before  the date of introduction. During this period, the manufacturer may  request a meeting with the agency to further explain the bases for its  evaluations and conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 90 days after its receipt of the manufacturer's  submission under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, NHTSA considers that  submission, if any, and independently makes, on a preliminary basis, the  determinations of those light duty truck lines with sub-median or likely  sub-median theft rates which should or should not be subject to Sec.  541.5 of this chapter. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of the  agency's preliminary determinations, together with the factual  information considered by the agency in making them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider any of its  preliminary determinations made under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.  The manufacturer must submit its request to the agency within 30 days of  its receipt of the letter under paragraph (c)(4) of this section  informing it of the agency's evaluations and preliminary determinations.  The request must include the facts and arguments underlying the  manufacturer's objections to the agency's preliminary determinations.  During this 30-day period, the manufacturer may also request a meeting  with the agency to discuss those objections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each of the agency's preliminary determinations made under  paragraph (c)(4) of this section becomes final 45 days after the agency  sends the letter   specified in that paragraph unless a request for reconsideration has  been received in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If  such a request has been received, the agency makes its final  determinations within 60 days of its receipt of the request. NHTSA  informs the manufacturer by letter of those determinations and its  response to the request for reconsideration.  [69 FR 17968, Apr. 6, 2004]</p>
