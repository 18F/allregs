Receipt of such request does not commit FMCS to provide its services. FMCS has the discretion to determine whether or not to perform grievance mediation, as such service may not be appropriate in all cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The guidelines for FMCS grievance mediation are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parties shall submit a joint request, signed by both parties requesting FMCS assistance.

No record, stenographic or tape recordings of the meetings will be made. The mediators notes are confidential and content shall not be revealed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The mediator shall conduct the mediation conference utilizing all of the customary techniques associated with mediation including the use of separate caucuses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The mediator had no authority to compel resolution of the grievance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In the event that no settlement is reached during the mediation conference, the mediator may provide the parties either in separate or joint session with an oral advisory opinion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If either party does not accept an advisory opinion, the matter may then proceed to arbitration in the manner form provided in their collective bargaining agreement. Such arbitration hearings will be held as if the grievance mediation effort had not taken place. Nothing said or done by the parties or the mediator during the grievance mediation session can be used during arbitration proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When the parties choose the FMCS grievance mediation procedure, they have agreed to abide by these guidelines established by FMCS, and it is understood that the parties and the grievant shall hold FMCS and the mediator appointed by the Service to conduct the mediation conference harmless of any claim of damages arising from the mediation process.
