                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply--</p><p class="depth0">Actually paid means that the costs must be actually incurred by the Part D sponsor and must be net of any direct or indirect remuneration (including discounts, charge backs or rebates, cash discounts, free goods contingent on a purchase agreement, up-front payments, coupons, goods in kind, free or reduced-price services, grants, or other price concessions or similar benefits offered to some or all purchasers) from any source (including manufacturers, pharmacies, enrollees, or any other person) that would serve to decrease the costs incurred under the Part D plan. Direct and indirect remuneration includes discounts, chargebacks or rebates, cash discounts, free goods contingent on a purchase agreement, up-front payments, coupons, goods in kind, free or reduced-price services, grants, or other price concessions or similar benefits from manufacturers, pharmacies or similar entities obtained by an intermediary contracting organization with which the Part D plan sponsor has contracted, regardless of whether the intermediary contracting organization retains all or a portion of the direct and indirect remuneration or passes the entire direct and indirect remuneration to the Part D plan sponsor and regardless of the terms of the contract between the plan sponsor and the intermediary contracting organization.</p><p class="depth0">Administrative costs means costs incurred by a Part D sponsor in complying with the requirements of this Part for a coverage year and that are not drug costs incurred to purchase or reimburse the purchase of Part D drugs. Administrative costs include amounts paid by the Part D sponsor to an intermediary contracting organization for covered Part D drugs dispensed to enrollees in the sponsor's Part D plan that differ from the amount paid by the intermediary contracting organization to a pharmacy or other entity that is the final dispenser of the covered Part D drugs. For example, any

profit or loss retained by an intermediary contracting organization (through discounts, rebates, or other direct or indirect price concessions) when negotiating prices with dispensing entities is considered an administrative cost.</p><p class="depth0">Allowable reinsurance costs means the subset of gross covered prescription drug costs actually paid that are attributable to basic prescription drug coverage for covered Part D drugs only and that are actually paid by the Part D sponsor or by (or on behalf of) an enrollee under the Part D plan. The costs for any Part D plan offering enhanced alternative coverage must be adjusted not only to exclude any costs attributable to benefits beyond basic prescription drug coverage, but also to exclude any costs determined to be attributable to increased utilization over the standard prescription drug coverage as the result of the insurance effect of enhanced alternative coverage in accordance with CMS guidelines on actuarial valuation.</p><p class="depth0">Allowable risk corridor costs means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The subset of costs incurred under a Part D plan (not including administrative costs, but including dispensing fees) that are attributable to basic prescription drug coverage only and that are incurred and actually paid by the Part D sponsor to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A dispensing pharmacy or other dispensing provider (whether directly or through an intermediary contracting organization) under the Part D plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The parties listed in Sec. 423.464(f)(1) of this part with which the Part D sponsor must coordinate benefits, including other Part D plans, as the result of any reconciliation process developed by CMS under Sec. 423.464 of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> An enrollee (or third party paying on behalf of the enrollee) to indemnify the enrollee when the reimbursement is associated with obtaining drugs under the Part D plan; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> These costs must be based upon imposition of the maximum amount of copayments permitted under Sec. 423.782 of this part. The costs for any Part D plan offering enhanced alternative coverage must be adjusted not only to exclude any costs attributable to benefits beyond basic prescription drug coverage, but also to exclude any prescription drug coverage costs determined to be attributable to increased utilization over standard prescription drug coverage as the result of the insurance effect of enhanced alternative coverage in accordance with CMS guidelines on actuarial valuation.</p><p class="depth0">Coverage year means a calendar year in which covered Part D drugs are dispensed if the claim for those drugs (and payment on the claim) is made not later than 3 months after the end of the year</p><p class="depth0">Gross covered prescription drug costs mean those actually paid costs incurred under a Part D plan, excluding administrative costs, but including dispensing fees, during the coverage year. They equal the sum of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The share of actual costs (as defined by Sec. 423.100 of this part) actually paid by the Part D plan that is received as reimbursement by the pharmacy, or other dispensing entity, reimbursement paid to indemnify an enrollee when the reimbursement is associated with an enrollee obtaining covered Part D drugs under the Part D plan, or payments made by the Part D sponsor to other parties listed in Sec. 423.464(f)(1) of this part with which the Part D sponsor must coordinate benefits, including other Part D plans, or as the result of any reconciliation process developed by CMS under Sec. 423.464 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Nominal cost-sharing paid by or on behalf of an enrollee which is associated with drugs that would otherwise be covered Part D drugs, as defined in Sec. 423.100 of this part, but are instead paid for, with the exception of said nominal cost-sharing, by a patient assistance program providing assistance outside the Part D benefit, provided that documentation of such nominal cost-sharing has been submitted to the Part D plan consistent with the plan processes and instructions for the submission of such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> All amounts paid under the Part D plan by or on behalf of an enrollee (such as the deductible, coinsurance, cost sharing, or amounts between the initial coverage limit and the out-of-pocket threshold) in order to obtain Part D drugs that are covered under

the Part D plan. If an enrollee who is paying 100 percent cost sharing (as a result of paying a deductible or because the enrollee is between the initial coverage limit and the out-of-pocket threshold) obtains a covered Part D drug at a lower cost than is available under the Part D plan, such cost-sharing will be considered an amount paid under the plan by or on behalf of an enrollee under the previous sentence of this definition, if the enrollee's costs are incurred costs as defined under Sec. 423.100 of this part and documentation of the incurred costs has been submitted to the Part D plan consistent with plan processes and instructions for the submission of such information. These costs are determined regardless of whether the coverage under the plan exceeds basic prescription drug coverage.</p><p class="depth2">Target amount means the total amount of payments (from both CMS and by or on behalf of enrollees) to a Part D plan for the coverage year for all standardized bid amounts as risk adjusted under Sec. 423.329(b)(1) of this part, less the administrative expenses (including return on investment) assumed in the standardized bids.
