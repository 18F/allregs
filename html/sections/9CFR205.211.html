                                Sec. 205.211  Applicability of court decisions under the UCC.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Court decisions under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), about  the scope of the ``farm products'' exception in Section 9-307(1)  thereof, and interpreting the terms therein, particularly ``person  engaged in farming operations'' which is not defined in the Section, are  applicable to an extent in interpreting the Section. The basis of this  is the legislative intent of the Section to pre-empt State laws  reflecting that ``farm products'' exception, as shown in the House  Committee Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-271, Part 1, September 13,  1985, at pages 108 et seq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> That UCC Section 9-307(1) reads as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A buyer in ordinary course of business (subsection (9) of  Section 1-201) other than a person buying farm products from a person  engaged in farming operations takes free of a security interest created  by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even  though the buyer knows of its existence. (emphasis added)    Sec. 205.212  ``Buyer in ordinary course of business'' and ``security interest.''</p><p class="depth0">The terms ``buyer in ordinary course of business'' and ``security  interest'' are defined in subsections (c) (1) and (7). There are  differences between those definitions and the UCC definitions of the  same terms. In interpreting those differences, the following would be  pertinent:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The legislative intent discussed above in Sec. 205.211, to pre- empt State laws reflecting the ``farm products'' exception; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> that  certain persons take free and clear of certain interests of a ``secured  lender'' ``when the seller fails to repay the lender,'' unless such  persons have information about such interests made available to them as  provided in the Section.</p>
