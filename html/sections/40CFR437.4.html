Alternatively, a multiple  wastestream subcategory facility may certify that it provides equivalent  treatment as defined in Sec. 437.2(h) for the applicable waste and  monitor for compliance with the applicable set of multiple wastestream  subcategory limitations after mixing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facilities subject to one or more subpart of this part must  monitor for compliance with the applicable subpart after treatment and  before mixing of the waste with wastes of any other subpart,  uncontaminated storm water, or wastewater subject to another effluent  limitation or standard in subchapter N. If, however, the facility can  demonstrate to the receiving POTW or permitting authority the capability  of achieving the effluent limitation or standard for each subpart after  treatment and before mixing with other wastestreams, the facility may  monitor for compliance after mixing. In the case of a facility which  elects to comply with the applicable set of multiple wastestream  subcategory limitations or standards, it is only subject to one subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a CWT facility treats any waste receipt that contains  cyanide at a concentration higher than 136 mg/L, the CWT facility must  monitor for cyanide after cyanide treatment and before dilution with  other wastestreams. If, however, the facility can demonstrate to the  receiving POTW or permitting authority the capability of achieving the  cyanide limitation or standard after cyanide treatment and before mixing  with other wastestreams, the facility may monitor for compliance after  mixing.</p>
