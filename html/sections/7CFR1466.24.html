In accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, an applicant applying as a joint operation or legal entity must provide a list of all members of the legal entity and joint operation and associated embedded entities, along with the members' social security numbers and percentage interest in the joint operation or legal entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contracts with Indian Tribes are not subject to payment or contract limitations. Indian Tribes will certify in writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive more than the payment limitation. Certification provided at the time of enrollment will cover the entire contract period. The Tribal entity must also provide, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment limitations apply to individual Tribal member(s) when applying and subsequently being granted a contract as an individual(s). American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual Tribal member that is identified utilizing a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax identification number will utilize only that identifier for all contracts to which the individual Tribal member receives a payment directly or indirectly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To be eligible to receive a payment, all legal entities or persons applying, either alone or as part of a joint operation, must provide a tax identification number and percentage interest in the legal entity.

Eligibility for advance payment is contingent upon the requirement that the participant must obtain an NRCS approved practice design prior to approval of the advance payment. Advance funds paid to program participants must be expended within 90 days from receipt of funds or returned to NRCS within a reasonable time as determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Before NRCS will approve and issue any EQIP payment, the participant must certify that the conservation practice has been completed in accordance with contract requirements, and NRCS or an approved TSP must certify that the practice has been carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS FOTG technical standards.</p>
