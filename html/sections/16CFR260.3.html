                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following general principles apply to all environmental  marketing claims, including those described in Sec. Sec. 260.4 through  240.16. Claims should comport with all relevant provisions of these  guides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Qualifications and disclosures. To prevent deceptive claims,  qualifications and disclosures should be clear, prominent, and  understandable. To make disclosures clear and prominent, marketers  should use plain language and sufficiently large type, should place  disclosures in close proximity to the qualified claim, and should avoid  making inconsistent statements or using distracting elements that could  undercut or contradict the disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distinction between benefits of product, package, and service.  Unless it is clear from the context, an environmental marketing claim  should specify whether it refers to the product, the product's  packaging, a service, or just to a portion of the product, package, or  service. In general, if the environmental attribute applies to all but  minor, incidental components of a product or package, the marketer need  not qualify the claim to identify that fact. However, there may be  exceptions to this general principle. For example, if a marketer makes  an unqualified recyclable claim, and the presence of the incidental  component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, the  claim would be deceptive.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A plastic package containing a new shower curtain is  labeled ``recyclable'' without further elaboration. Because the context  of the claim does not make clear whether it refers to the plastic  package or   the shower curtain, the claim is deceptive if any part of either the  package or the curtain, other than minor, incidental components, cannot  be recycled.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A soft drink bottle is labeled ``recycled.'' The bottle  is made entirely from recycled materials, but the bottle cap is not.  Because the bottle cap is a minor, incidental component of the package,  the claim is not deceptive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Overstatement of environmental attribute. An environmental  marketing claim should not overstate, directly or by implication, an  environmental attribute or benefit. Marketers should not state or imply  environmental benefits if the benefits are negligible.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: An area rug is labeled ``50% more recycled content than  before.'' The manufacturer increased the recycled content of its rug  from 2% recycled fiber to 3%. Although the claim is technically true, it  likely conveys the false impression that the manufacturer has increased  significantly the use of recycled fiber.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A trash bag is labeled ``recyclable'' without  qualification. Because trash bags ordinarily are not separated from  other trash at the landfill or incinerator for recycling, they are  highly unlikely to be used again for any purpose. Even if the bag is  technically capable of being recycled, the claim is deceptive since it  asserts an environmental benefit where no meaningful benefit exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Comparative claims. Comparative environmental marketing claims  should be clear to avoid consumer confusion about the comparison.  Marketers should have substantiation for the comparison.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: An advertiser notes that its glass bathroom tiles contain  ``20% more recycled content.'' Depending on the context, the claim could  be a comparison either to the advertiser's immediately preceding product  or to its competitors' products. The advertiser should have  substantiation for both interpretations. Otherwise, the advertiser  should make the basis for comparison clear, for example, by saying ``20%  more recycled content than our previous bathroom tiles.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: An advertiser claims that ``our plastic diaper liner has  the most recycled content.'' The diaper liner has more recycled content,  calculated as a percentage of weight, than any other on the market,  although it is still well under 100%. The claim likely conveys that the  product contains a significant percentage of recycled content and has  significantly more recycled content than its competitors. If the  advertiser cannot substantiate these messages, the claim would be  deceptive.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: An advertiser claims that its packaging creates ``less  waste than the leading national brand.'' The advertiser implemented the  source reduction several years ago and supported the claim by  calculating the relative solid waste contributions of the two packages.  The advertiser should have substantiation that the comparison remains  accurate.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4: A product is advertised as ``environmentally  preferable.'' This claim likely conveys that the product is  environmentally superior to other products. Because it is highly  unlikely that the marketer can substantiate the messages conveyed by  this statement, this claim is deceptive. The claim would not be  deceptive if the marketer accompanied it with clear and prominent  language limiting the environmental superiority representation to the  particular attributes for which the marketer has substantiation,  provided the advertisement's context does not imply other deceptive  claims. For example, the claim ``Environmentally preferable: contains  50% recycled content compared to 20% for the leading brand'' would not  be deceptive.</p>
