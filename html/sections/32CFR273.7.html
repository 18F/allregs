This property does not require transport to a DLA Disposition Services site. Authorized excess DoD property is transferred between the RCP account and the DLA Disposition Services account (SC4402).

For example, HP will be processed on HW disposal service contracts. Other property will be downgraded to scrap, demilitarized, processed for A/D, or disposed of through a DLA Disposition Services service contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites minimize processing delays as much as possible. In the event a site is unable to physically accept the property at the desired time and location due to workload, generating activities may retain the property for processing in-place, seek another DLA Disposition Services site, or hold the property until the DLA Disposition Services site is able to receive the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accept and process nonsalable materiel that has no reutilization, transfer, donation, or sale value but is not otherwise restricted from disposal by U.S. law or Federal or military regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that disposition is by the most economical and practical method; for example, donation in lieu of A/D or through a service contract that meets minimum legal requirements for disposal of the specific types of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites may not accept (either physically or on its account) and no reutilization or sale service will be given for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Radioactive waste, items, devices, or materiel (all materiel that is radioactive).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unsalable materiel of a non-hazardous nature.

If refuse and trash, when properly segregated, possesses RTDS potential, disposition may be accomplished via DLA Disposition Services, recycling provisions of refuse collection contracts, in-house refuse operations, or QRPs as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The DLA Disposition Services site operating as a tenant on an installation will notify the host activity when unauthorized shipments are received at the DLA Disposition Services site (including off-site shipments) of radioactive items, classified material, nuclear weapons-related materiel, and classified and unclassified information systems security material (CRYPTO/COMSEC). The host activity will be responsible for retrieving and securing any radioactive items, classified items and unclassified information systems security material (CRYPTO/COMSEC) immediately upon request of the DLA Disposition Services site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites will not accept scrap accumulations that are contaminated or commingled with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> MPPEH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> MLI that require DEMIL (DEMIL Codes C, D, E and F) and MLI that require mutilation (DEMIL Code B).

When scrap piles are being built by the DLA Disposition Services site, the same principles apply. Scrap generated from explosive and incendiary items and chemical ammunition is dangerous and will not be commingled with other types of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Documentation for disposal through DLA Disposition Services. (1) Use DoD automated information systems to the extent practical to prepare documentation for excess, surplus, or scrap DoD property or FEPP.

If the property remains at the generating activity site for receipt-in-place and an inventory discrepancy surfaces, the generating activity will research and provide a report of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property in accordance with procedures in DoD 7000.14-R Volume 12, Chapter 7.

DLA Disposition Services sites will honor these requests. Otherwise, items will not be removed from batchlots.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites are responsible for ensuring official receipt copies are returned accessible to generating activities (electronically or hard copy). They must provide tracing assistance for any DTID receipt copy not received by the generating activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Identification, barcoding, and storage requirements. (1) Usable property, transferred to a DLA Disposition Services site or received in original location, must be clearly identified with barcode labels. The labels will be affixed to property from time of receipt (physically or receipt-in-place) until final removal and will correspond with accountability records.

The pocket reference is formatted alphabetically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Barcoded labels are not required for scrap accumulations. However, both the generating activity and DLA Disposition Services accounting records must correspond with the scrap identifications and weights.

(1) Correct accounting for all excess property, surplus property, and FEPP by both the Military Departments and DLA Disposition Services sites is critical.

DLA Disposition Services' accountability system will incorporate the requirements of DoD Directive 8320.02, 15 CFR parts 730 through 799, and DLA Regulation 7500.1, ``Accountability and Responsibility for Government Property

This includes property returned to a DLA Disposition Services site from a joint commercial sales partner that has been confirmed as mis-described or as containing only basic material content value. Similar items received within a 12-month period that have a history of being nonsalable may be downgraded to scrap at ESD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When a DLA Disposition Services site determines obsolete printed materials have no RTD potential and only scrap market value, these items will be downgraded to scrap upon receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When end items are turned in as scrap and are reclaimed or disassembled for their usable components, the DLA Disposition Services site's records will be adjusted to reflect the acquisition cost (estimated, if not known) of the components removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Scrap accounting is calculated by weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Estimated weight may be used for receiving scrap if scales are not available or if weighing is impractical. Disposition of scrap for sale or demanufacturing must be weighed to provide accurate accounting and reconciliation with the DLA Disposition Services accountable record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The acceptable degree of accuracy of estimation is 25 percent for property processed by the ton, and 10 percent for property processed by the pound. Overages and shortages discovered on release of property that exceed allowable tolerances will be adjusted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> High value scrap must be weighed at the time of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Calibration and maintenance of weigh scales.

maintained, repaired, and calibrated annually or more often if required by State or local laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DoD activities, including DLA Disposition Services sites with scales used for receipts and disposition of scrap, will ensure weigh scales under their jurisdiction are

Inventory accuracy of at least 90 percent will be maintained for all usable property, except DEMIL required property, HP, and pilferable or sensitive property.
