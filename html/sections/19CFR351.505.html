                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of a loan, a benefit exists  to the extent that the amount a firm pays on the government-provided  loan is less than the amount the firm would pay on a comparable  commercial loan(s) that the firm could actually obtain on the market.  See section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act. In making the comparison called  for in the preceding sentence, the Secretary normally will rely on  effective interest rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Comparable commercial loan'' defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Comparable''  defined. In selecting a loan that is ``comparable'' to the government- provided loan, the Secretary normally will place primary emphasis on  similarities in the structure of the loans (e.g., fixed interest rate v.  variable interest rate), the maturity of   the loans (e.g., short-term v. long-term), and the currency in which the  loans are denominated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Commercial'' defined. In selecting a ``commercial'' loan, the  Secretary normally will use a loan taken out by the firm from a  commercial lending institution or a debt instrument issued by the firm  in a commercial market. Also, the Secretary will treat a loan from a  government-owned bank as a commercial loan, unless there is evidence  that the loan from a government-owned bank is provided on non-commercial  terms or at the direction of the government. However, the Secretary will  not consider a loan provided under a government program, or a loan  provided by a government-owned special purpose bank, to be a commercial  loan for purposes of selecting a loan to compare with a government- provided loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Long-term loans. In selecting a comparable loan, if the  government-provided loan is a long-term loan, the Secretary normally  will use a loan the terms of which were established during, or  immediately before, the year in which the terms of the government- provided loan were established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Short-term loans. In making the comparison required under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the government-provided loan is a  short-term loan, the Secretary normally will use an annual average of  the interest rates on comparable commercial loans during the year in  which the government-provided loan was taken out, weighted by the  principal amount of each loan. However, if the Secretary finds that  interest rates fluctuated significantly during the period of  investigation or review, the Secretary will use the most appropriate  interest rate based on the circumstances presented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Could actually obtain on the market'' defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  In selecting a comparable commercial loan that the recipient ``could  actually obtain on the market,'' the Secretary normally will rely on the  actual experience of the firm in question in obtaining comparable  commercial loans for both short-term and long-term loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the firm has no comparable commercial loans. If the firm  did not take out any comparable commercial loans during the period  referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(2)(iv) of this section, the  Secretary may use a national average interest rate for comparable  commercial loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception for uncreditworthy companies. If the Secretary finds  that a firm that received a government-provided long-term loan was  uncreditworthy, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the  Secretary normally will calculate the interest rate to be used in making  the comparison called for by paragraph (a)(1) of this section according  to the following formula:  ib = [(1 - qn)(1 + if)\n\ / (1 -  pn)]\1/n\ - 1,  where:  n = the term of the loan; ib = the benchmark interest rate for uncreditworthy</p><p class="depth0">companies; if = the long-term interest rate that would be paid by a</p><p class="depth0">creditworthy company; pn = the probability of default by an uncreditworthy company</p><p class="depth0">within n years; and qn = the probability of default by a creditworthy company</p><p class="depth0">within n years.   ``Default'' means any missed or delayed payment of interest and/or  principal, bankruptcy, receivership, or distressed exchange. For values  of pn, the Secretary will normally rely on the average  cumulative default rates reported for the Caa to C-rated category of  companies in Moody's study of historical default rates of corporate bond  issuers. For values of qn, the Secretary will normally rely  on the average cumulative default rates reported for the Aaa to Baa- rated categories of companies in Moody's study of historical default  rates of corporate bond issuers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Uncreditworthiness--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The Secretary will consider  a firm to be uncreditworthy if the Secretary determines that, based on  information available at the time of the government-provided loan, the  firm could not have obtained long-term loans from conventional  commercial sources. The Secretary will determine uncreditworthiness on a  case-by-case basis, and may, in appropriate circumstances, focus its  creditworthiness analysis on the project being financed rather than the  company as a whole. In   making the creditworthiness determination, the Secretary may examine,  among other factors, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The receipt by the firm of comparable commercial long-term  loans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The present and past financial health of the firm, as reflected  in various financial indicators calculated from the firm's financial  statements and accounts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The firm's recent past and present ability to meet its costs and  fixed financial obligations with its cash flow; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Evidence of the firm's future financial position, such as market  studies, country and industry economic forecasts, and project and loan  appraisals prepared prior to the agreement between the lender and the  firm on the terms of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significance of long-term commercial loans. In the case of  firms not owned by the government, the receipt by the firm of comparable  long-term commercial loans, unaccompanied by a government-provided  guarantee, will normally constitute dispositive evidence that the firm  is not uncreditworthy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Significance of prior subsidies. In determining whether a firm  is uncreditworthy, the Secretary will ignore current and prior subsidies  received by the firm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Discount rate. When the creditworthiness of a firm is  considered in connection with the allocation of non-recurring benefits,  the Secretary will rely on information available in the year in which  the government agreed to provide the subsidy conferring a non-recurring  benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Long-term variable rate loans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a  long-term variable rate loan, the Secretary normally will make the  comparison called for by paragraph (a)(1) of this section by relying on  a comparable commercial loan with a variable interest rate. The  Secretary then will compare the variable interest rates on the  comparable commercial loan and the government-provided loan for the year  in which the terms of the government-provided loan were established. If  the comparison shows that the interest rate on the government-provided  loan was equal to or higher than the interest rate on the comparable  commercial loan, the Secretary will not consider the government-provided  loan as having conferred a benefit. If the comparison shows that the  interest rate on the government-provided loan was lower, the Secretary  will consider the government-provided loan as having conferred a  benefit, and, if the other criteria for a countervailable subsidy are  satisfied, will calculate the amount of the benefit in accordance with  paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. If the Secretary is unable to make the comparison  described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section or if the comparison  described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section would yield an  inaccurate measure of the benefit, the Secretary may modify the method  described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allegations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allegation of uncreditworthiness required.  Normally, the Secretary will not consider the uncreditworthiness of a  firm absent a specific allegation by the petitioner that is supported by  information establishing a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that  the firm is uncreditworthy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Government-owned banks. The Secretary will not investigate a  loan provided by a government-owned bank absent a specific allegation  that is supported by information reasonably available to petitioners  indicating that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The loan meets the specificity criteria in accordance with  section 771(5A) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A benefit exists within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time of receipt of benefit. In the case of loans described in  paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(4) of this section, the Secretary  normally will consider a benefit as having been received in the year in  which the firm otherwise would have had to make a payment on the  comparable commercial loan. In the case of a loan described in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit  as having been received in the year in which the firm receives the  proceeds of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of benefit to a particular time period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Short- term loans. The   Secretary will allocate (expense) the benefit from a short-term loan to  the year(s) in which the firm is due to make interest payments on the  loan. In no event may the present value (in the year of receipt of the  loan) of the amounts calculated under the preceding sentence exceed the  principal of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Long-term fixed-rate loans with concessionary interest rates.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Secretary  normally will calculate the subsidy amount to be assigned to a  particular year by calculating the difference in interest payments for  that year, i.e., the difference between the interest paid by the firm in  that year on the government-provided loan and the interest the firm  would have paid on the comparison loan. However, in no event may the  present value (in the year of receipt of the loan) of the amounts  calculated under the preceding sentence exceed the principal of the  loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Long-term fixed-rate loans with different repayment schedules-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculation of present value of benefit. Where the government- provided loan and the loan to which it is compared under paragraph (a)  of this section are both long-term, fixed-interest rate loans, but have  different grace periods or maturities, or where the shapes of the  repayment schedules differ, the Secretary will determine the total  benefit by calculating the present value, in the year that repayment  would begin on the comparable commercial loan, of the difference between  the amount that the firm is to pay on the government-provided loan and  the amount that the firm would have paid on the comparison loan. In no  event may the total benefit calculated under the preceding sentence  exceed the principal of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of annual benefit. With respect to the benefit  calculated under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary will  determine the portion of that benefit to be assigned to a particular  year by using the formula set forth in Sec. 351.524(d)(1) and the  following parameters:  Ak = the amount countervailed in year k, y = the present value of the benefit (see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this</p><p class="depth0">section), n = the number of years in the life of the loan, d = the interest rate on the comparison loan selected under paragraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of this section, and k = the year of allocation, where the year that repayment would begin on</p><p class="depth0">the comparable commercial loan = 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Long-term variable interest rate loans. In the case of a  government-provided long-term variable-rate loan, the Secretary normally  will determine the amount of the benefit attributable to a particular  year by calculating the difference in payments for that year, i.e., the  difference between the amount paid by the firm in that year on the  government-provided loan and the amount the firm would have paid on the  comparison loan. However, in no event may the present value (in the year  of receipt of the loan) of the amounts calculated under the preceding  sentence exceed the principal of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contingent liability interest-free loans--(1) Treatment as  loans. In the case of an interest-free loan, for which the repayment  obligation is contingent upon the company taking some future action or  achieving some goal in fulfillment of the loan's requirements, the  Secretary normally will treat any balance on the loan outstanding during  a year as an interest-free, short-term loan in accordance with  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. However, if the event  upon which repayment of the loan depends will occur at a point in time  more than one year after the receipt of the contingent liability loan,  the Secretary will use a long-term interest rate as the benchmark in  accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(2) of this section. In no  event may the present value (in the year of receipt of the contingent  liability loan) of the amounts calculated under this paragraph exceed  the principal of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment as grants. If, at any point in time, the Secretary  determines that the event upon which repayment depends is not a viable  contingency, the Secretary will treat the outstanding balance of the  loan as a grant received in the year in which this condition manifests  itself.</p>
