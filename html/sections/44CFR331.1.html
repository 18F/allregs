                            <p class="depth0">Success of the national defense program depends upon efficient use of all of our resources, including the labor force and production facilities, which are preserved through utilizing the skills of both management and labor. A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.</p>
