                            <p class="depth0">Success of the national defense program depends upon efficient use  of all of our resources, including the labor force and production  facilities, which are preserved through utilizing the skills of both  management and labor. A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to  encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers  in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting  in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When  large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens  are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing,  transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment  develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to  the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and  unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it  is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to  the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate  procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.</p>
