                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Counterfeit mark defined. A ``counterfeit mark'' is a spurious  mark that is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a  mark registered on the Principal Register of the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Detention. CBP may detain any article of domestic or foreign  manufacture imported into the United States that bears a mark suspected  of being a counterfeit version of a mark that is registered with the  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and is recorded with CBP pursuant to  subpart A of this part. The detention will be for a period of up to  thirty days from the date on which the merchandise is presented for  examination. The 30-day time period may be extended for up to an  additional thirty days for good cause shown by the importer. In  accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1499, if after the detention period and any  authorized extensions the article is not released the article will be  deemed excluded for the purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice to importer of detention and possible disclosure. Within  five days (excluding weekends and holidays) from the date of a decision  to detain, CBP will notify the importer in writing of the detention. The  notice will inform the importer that a disclosure of information  concerning the detained merchandise may be made to the owner of the mark  to assist CBP in determining whether any marks are counterfeit, unless  the importer presents information within seven days of the notification  (excluding weekends and holidays) establishing to CBP's satisfaction  that the detained merchandise does not bear a counterfeit mark. CBP may  disclose information appearing on the merchandise and/or its retail  packaging, images (including photographs) of the merchandise and/or its  retail packaging in its condition as presented for examination, or a  sample of the merchandise and/or its retail packaging in its condition  as presented for examination. The release (disclosure) of a sample is  subject to the bond and return requirements of paragraph (c) of this  section. Where the importer does not timely provide information or the  information provided is insufficient for CBP to determine that the  merchandise does not bear a counterfeit mark, CBP may proceed with the  disclosure to the owner of the mark, and will so notify the importer.  Disclosure under this section may include any serial numbers, dates of  manufacture, lot codes, batch numbers, universal product codes, or other  identifying marks appearing on the merchandise or its retail packaging,  in alphanumeric or other formats.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice to owner of the mark and disclosure of information. From  the time merchandise is presented for examination until the time a  notice of detention is issued, CBP may disclose to the owner of the mark  any of the following   information in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an  imported article bears a counterfeit mark. Once a notice of detention is  issued, CBP will disclose to the owner of the mark the following  information, if available, within thirty days (excluding weekends and  holidays) from the date of detention:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of importation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The port of entry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The description of the merchandise from the entry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The quantity involved; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The country of origin of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during  examination, testing, or other use.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during examination, testing, or  other use.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Seizure. Upon a determination by CBP, made any time after the  merchandise has been presented for examination, that an article of  domestic or foreign manufacture imported into the United States bears a  counterfeit mark, CBP will seize such merchandise and, in the absence of  the written consent of the owner of the mark, forfeit the seized  merchandise in accordance with the customs laws. When merchandise is  seized under this section, CBP will disclose to the owner of the mark  the following information, if available, within thirty days (excluding  weekends and holidays) from the date of the notice of seizure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of importation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The port of entry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The description of the merchandise from the entry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The quantity involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The name and address of the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The country of origin of the merchandise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The name and address of the exporter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The name and address of the importer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> was (damaged/destroyed/lost)  during examination, testing, or other use.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consent of the mark owner; failure to make appropriate  disposition. The owner of the mark, within thirty days from notification  of seizure, may provide written consent to the importer allowing the  importation of the seized merchandise in its condition as imported or  its exportation, entry after obliteration of the mark, or other  appropriate disposition. Otherwise, the merchandise will be disposed of  in accordance with Sec. 133.52 of this part, subject to the importer's  right to petition for relief from forfeiture under the provisions of  part 171 of this chapter.
