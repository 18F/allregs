The public agency must provide notice to the parents of a child with a disability, in accordance with Sec. 300.503, that describes any evaluation procedures the agency proposes to conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conduct of evaluation. In conducting the evaluation, the public agency must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about the child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The content of the child's IEP, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child, to participate in appropriate activities);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability and for determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other evaluation procedures.
