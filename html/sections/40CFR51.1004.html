The Administrator may extend the attainment date to the extent the Administrator determines appropriate, for a period no greater than 10 years from the date of designation, considering the severity of nonattainment and the availability and feasibility of pollution control measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the SIP submittal for each of its nonattainment areas, the State must submit an attainment demonstration justifying its proposed attainment date. For each nonattainment area, the Administrator will approve an attainment date at the same time the Administrator approves the attainment demonstration for the area, consistent with the attainment date timing provision of section 172(a)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon a determination by EPA that an area designated nonattainment for the PM2.5 NAAQS has attained the standard, the requirements for such

area to submit attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the PM2.5 NAAQS shall be suspended until such time as: the area is redesignated to attainment, at which time the requirements no longer apply; or EPA determines that the area has violated the PM2.5 NAAQS, at which time the area is again required to submit such plans.</p>
