The port director may require an extra copy or copies of Form 7512 to be furnished for use in connection with delivery of the merchandise to the carrier named in the entry.

A charge shall be made against the continuous bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.64 of this chapter, if on file, or if a continuous bond is not on file, a single entry bond containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.64 shall be required as in the case of residue cargo for foreign ports.
