The destruction,  absence of, or respondent's failure to provide research records  adequately documenting the questioned research is evidence of research  misconduct where the institution or HHS establishes by a preponderance  of the evidence that the respondent intentionally, knowingly, or  recklessly had research records and destroyed them, had the opportunity  to maintain the records but did not do so, or maintained the records and  failed to produce them in a timely manner and that the respondent's  conduct constitutes a significant departure from accepted practices of  the relevant research community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The respondent has the burden of going forward with and the  burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any and all  affirmative defenses raised. In determining whether HHS or the  institution has carried the burden   of proof imposed by this part, the finder of fact shall give due  consideration to admissible, credible evidence of honest error or  difference of opinion presented by the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving  by a preponderance of the evidence any mitigating factors that are  relevant to a decision to impose administrative actions following a  research misconduct proceeding.</p>
