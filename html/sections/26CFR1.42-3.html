                                Sec.  1.42-3  Treatment of buildings financed with proceeds from a section 721 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA).

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treatment under sections 42(i) and 42(b). A below market loan funded in

whole or in part with funds from an Affordable Housing Program established under section 721 of FIRREA is not, solely by reason of the Affordable Housing Program funds, a below market Federal loan as defined in section 42(i)(2)(D). Thus, any building with respect to which the proceeds of the loan are used during the tax year is not, solely by reason of the Affordable Housing Program funds, treated as a federally subsidized building for that tax year and subsequent tax years for purposes of determining the applicable percentage for the building under section 42(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. The rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are effective for loans made after August 8, 1989.
