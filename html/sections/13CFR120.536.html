Except as otherwise provided in a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement with a Lender or an Agreement with a CDC, SBA must give its prior written consent before a Lender or CDC takes any of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increases the principal amount of a loan above that authorized by SBA at loan origination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confers a Preference on the Lender or CDC or engages in an activity that creates a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compromises the principal balance of a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Takes title to any property in the name of SBA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Takes title to environmentally contaminated property, or takes over operation and control of a business that handles hazardous substances or hazardous wastes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transfers, sells or pledges more than 90% of a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Takes any action for which prior written consent is required by a Loan Program Requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions by CDCs only (other than PCLP CDCs).

For all servicing/liquidation actions not requiring SBA's prior written consent, Lenders and CDCs must document the justifications for their decisions and retain these and supporting documents in their file for future SBA review to determine if the actions taken by the Lender or CDC were prudent, commercially reasonable, and complied with all Loan Program Requirements.
