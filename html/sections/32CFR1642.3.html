Support may be  financial assistance, personal care or companionship. If financial  assistance is the basis of support, the registrant's contribution must  be a substantial portion of the necessities of the dependent. Under most  circumstances 40 to 50% of the cost of the necessities may be considered  substantial. If that determination is affirmative, the board will  determine whether the registrant's induction would result in extreme  hardship to his wife when she is the only dependent, or whether the  registrant's deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s),  grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for  support, or because his wife and his child(ren), parent(s),  grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for  support. A deferment is advisable whenever the registrant's induction  would result in hardship to his dependents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The registrant's classification shall be determined on the basis  of the written information in his file, oral   statements, if made by the registrant at his personal appearance before  a board, and oral statements, if made by the registrant's witnesses at  his personal appearances.
