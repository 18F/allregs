                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule in the case of gifts made on or before December 31, 1976. (1)(i) Subject to the conditions and limitations provided in section 1015(d), as added by the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, the basis (as determined under section 1015(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1015-1) of property acquired by gift is increased by the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift of such property. Under section 1015(d)(1)(A), such increase in basis applies to property acquired by gift on or after September 2, 1958 (the date of enactment of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958). Under section 1015(d)(1)(B), such increase in basis applies to property acquired by gift before September 2, 1958, and not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before such date. If section 1015(d)(1)(A) applies, the basis of the property is increased as of the date of the gift regardless of the date of payment of the gift tax. For example, if the property was acquired by gift on September 8, 1958, and sold by the donee on October 15, 1958, the basis of the property would be increased (subject to the limitation of section 1015(d)) as of September 8, 1958 (the date of the gift), by the amount of gift tax applicable to such gift even though such tax was not paid until March 1, 1959. If section 1015(d)(1)(B) applies, any increase in the basis of the property due to gift tax paid (regardless of date of payment) with respect to the gift is made as of September 2, 1958. Any increase in basis under section 1015(d) can be no greater than the amount by which the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift exceeds the basis of such property in the hands of the donor at the time of the gift. See paragraph (b) of this section for rules for determining the amount of gift tax paid in respect of property transferred by gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Subject to the conditions and limitations provided in section 1015(d), as added by the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, the basis (as determined under section 1015(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1015-1) of property acquired by gift is increased by the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift of such property.

See paragraph (b) of this section for rules for determining the amount of gift tax paid in respect of property transferred by gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to property acquired by gift before September 2, 1958, the provisions of section 1015(d) and this section do not apply if, before such date, the donee has sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of such property. The phrase sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of includes the surrender of a stock certificate for corporate assets in complete or partial liquidation of a corporation pursuant to section 331. It also includes the exchange of property for property of a like kind such as the exchange of one apartment house for another. The phrase does not, however, extend to transactions which are mere changes in form. Thus, it does not include a transfer of assets to a corporation in exchange for its stock in a transaction with respect to which no gain or loss would be recognizable for income tax purposes under section 351. Nor does it include an exchange of stock or securities in a corporation for stock or securities in the same corporation or another corporation in a transaction such as a merger, recapitalization, reorganization, or other transaction described in section 368(a) or 355, with respect to which no gain or loss is recognizable for income tax purposes under section 354 or 355. If a binding contract for the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property is entered into, the property is considered as sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of on the effective date of the contract, unless the contract is not subsequently carried out substantially in accordance with its terms. The effective date of a contract is normally the date it is entered into (and not the date it is consummated, or the date legal title to the property passes) unless the contract specifies a different effective date. For purposes of this subdivision, in determining whether a transaction comes within the phrase sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, if a transaction would be treated as a mere change in the form of the property if it occurred in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, it will be so treated if the transaction occurred in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1938, A purchased a business building at a cost of $120,000. On September 2, 1958, at which time the property had an adjusted basis in A's hands of $60,000, he gave the property to his nephew, B. At the time of the gift to B, the property had a fair market value of $65,000 with respect to which A paid a gift tax in the amount of $7,545. The basis of the property in B's hands at the time of

the gift, as determined under section 1015(a) and Sec. 1.1015-1, would be the same as the adjusted basis in A's hands at the time of the gift, or $60,000. Under section 1015(d) and this section, the basis of the building in B's hands as of the date of the gift would be increased by the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to such gift, limited to an amount by which the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift exceeded the basis of the property in the hands of A at the time of gift, or $5,000. Therefore, the basis of the property in B's hands immediately after the gift, both for determining gain or loss on the sale of the property, would be $65,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C purchased property in 1938 at a cost of $100,000. On October 1, 1952, at which time the property had an adjusted basis of $72,000 in C's hands, he gave the property to his daughter, D. At the date of the gift to D, the property had a fair market value of $85,000 with respect to which C paid a gift tax in the amount of $11,745. On September 2, 1958, D still held the property which then had an adjusted basis in her hands of $65,000. Since the excess of the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift to D over the adjusted basis of the property in C's hands at such time is greater than the amount of gift tax paid, the basis of the property in D's hands would be increased as of September 2, 1958, by the amount of the gift tax paid, or $11,745. The adjusted basis of the property in D's hands, both for determining gain or loss on the sale of the property, would then be $76,745 ($65,000 plus $11,745).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On December 31, 1951, E gave to his son, F, 500 shares of common stock of the X Corporation which shares had been purchased earlier by E at a cost of $100 per share, or a total cost of $50,000. The basis in E's hands was still $50,000 on the date of the gift to F. On the date of the gift, the fair market value of the 500 shares was $80,000 with respect to which E paid a gift tax in the amount of $10,695. In 1956, the 500 shares of X Corporation stock were exchanged for 500 shares of common stock of the Y Corporation in a reorganization with respect to which no gain or loss was recognized for income tax purposes under section 354. F still held the 500 shares of Y Corporation stock on September 2, 1958. Under such circumstances, the 500 shares of X Corporation stock would not, for purposes of section 1015(d) and this section, be considered as having been sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by F before September 2, 1958. Therefore, the basis of the 500 shares of Y Corporation stock held by F as of such date would, by reason of section 1015(d) and this section, be increased by $10,695, the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift to F of the X Corporation stock.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On November 15, 1953, G gave H property which had a fair market value of $53,000 and a basis in the hands of G of $20,000. G paid gift tax of $5,250 on the transfer. On November 16, 1956, H gave the property to J who still held it on September 2, 1958. The value of the property on the date of the gift to J was $63,000 and H paid gift tax of $7,125 on the transfer. Since the property was not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by J before September 2, 1958, and the gift tax paid on the transfer to J did not exceed $43,000 ($63,000, fair market value of property at time of gift to J, less $20,000, basis of property in H's hands at that time), the basis of property in his hands is increased on September 2, 1958, by $7,125, the amount of gift tax paid by H on the transfer. No increase in basis is allowed for the $5,250 gift tax paid by G on the transfer to H, since H had sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of the property before September 2, 1958.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amount of gift tax paid with respect to gifts made on or before December 31, 1976. (1)(i) If only one gift was made during a certain calendar period (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the entire amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws for that calendar period is the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> If only one gift was made during a certain calendar period (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the entire amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws for that calendar period is the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If only one gift was made during a certain calendar period (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the entire amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws for that calendar period is the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to the gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If more than one gift was made during a certain calendar period, the amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws with respect to any specified gift made during that calendar period is an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the total gift tax paid for that calendar period) as C (the amount of the gift, computed as described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)) bears to D (the total taxable gifts for the calendar period computed without deduction for the gift tax specific exemption under section 2521 (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1976) or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws). Stated algebraically, the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to a gift equals:</p><p class="depth0">[Amount of the gift (C) / Total taxable gifts, plus specific exemption</p><p class="depth0">allowed (D)] x Total gift tax paid (B)

Prior to 1959 H made no taxable gifts. On July 1, 1959, he made a gift to his wife, W, of land having a value for gift purposes of $60,000 and gave to his son, S, certain securities valued at $60,000. During the year 1959, H also contributed $5,000 in cash to a charitable organization described in section 2522. H filed a timely gift tax return for 1959 with respect to which he paid gift tax in the amount of $6,000, computed as follows:

H filed his gift tax return for the third quarter of 1971 on November 15, 1971, as required by section 6075(b). With respect to the above gifts H paid a gift tax in the amount of $6,000 on total taxable gifts of $54,000 for the third quarter of 1971.

A and his wife, B, were married during the entire calendar year 1956. The amount of A's taxable gifts for prior years was zero although in arriving at that amount A had used in full the specific exemption authorized by section 2521. B did not make any gifts before 1956. A and B elected under section 2513 to have all gifts made by either during 1956 treated as made one-half by A and one-half by B.

As in example (3), the amount of A's taxable gifts for taxable years prior to 1972 was zero, although in arriving at that amount A had used in full the specific exemption authorized by section 2521. B did not make any gifts before 1972. Pursuant to the election under section 2513, A and B treated all gifts made by either during 1972 as made one-half by A and one-half by B. A and B each filed a gift tax return for the first quarter of 1972 on May 15, 1972, as required by section 6075(b).

In general, for purposes of section 1015(d)(6)(A)(ii), the amount of the gift is determined in conformance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, the amount of the gift is the amount included with respect to the gift in determining (for purposes of section 2503(a)) the total amount of gifts made during the calendar year (or calendar quarter in the case of a gift made on or before December 31, 1981), reduced by the amount of any annual exclusion allowable with respect to the gift under section 2503(b), and any deductions allowed with respect to the gift under section 2522 (relating to the charitable deduction) and section 2523 (relating to the marital deduction).

Where more than one gift is made by the donor in a calendar year (or quarter in the case of gifts made on or before December 31, 1981), the amount of gift tax paid with respect to any specific gift made during that period is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total gift tax paid for that period (determined after reduction for any gift tax unified credit available under section 2505) as the amount of the gift (computed as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) bears to the total taxable gifts for the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified domestic trusts. For purposes of section 1015(d)(6), in the case of a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) described in section 2056A(a), any distribution during the noncitizen surviving spouse's lifetime with respect to

which a tax is imposed under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) is treated as a transfer by gift, and any estate tax paid on the distribution under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) is treated as a gift tax. The rules under this paragraph apply in determining the extent to which the basis in the assets distributed is increased by the tax imposed under section 2056A(b)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. Application of the provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to 1995, X exhausts X's gift tax unified credit available under section 2505. In 1995, X makes a gift to X's child Y, of a parcel of real estate having a fair market value of $100,000. X's adjusted basis in the real estate immediately before making the gift was $70,000. Also in 1995, X makes a gift to X's child Z, of a painting having a fair market value of $70,000. X timely files a gift tax return for 1995 and pays gift tax in the amount of $55,500, computed as follows:
Value of real estate transferred to Y...........    $100,000  ..........Less: Annual exclusion..........................      10,000  ..........</p><p class="depth0">------------Included amount of gift (C).....................  ..........     $90,000Value of painting transferred to Z..............     $70,000  ..........Less: annual exclusion..........................      10,000  ..........</p><p class="depth0">------------Included amount of gift.........................  ..........      60,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total included gifts (D)....................  ..........    $150,000</p><p class="depth0">Total gift tax liability for 1995 gifts (B).  ..........     $55,500------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gift tax paid with respect to the real estate transferred to Y, is determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22AU95.005</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> The amount by which Y's basis in the real property is increased is determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22AU95.006</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount by which Y's basis in the real property is increased is determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22AU95.006</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Y's basis in the real property is $70,000 plus $11,100, or $81,100. If X had not exhausted any of X's unified credit, no gift tax would have been paid and, as a result, Y's basis would not be increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X dies in 1995. X's spouse, Y, is not a United States citizen. In order to obtain the marital deduction for property passing to X's spouse, X established a QDOT in X's will. In 1996, the trustee of the QDOT makes a distribution of principal from the QDOT in the form of shares of stock having a fair market value of $70,000 on the date of distribution. The trustee's basis in the stock (determined under section 1014) is $50,000. An estate tax is imposed on the distribution under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) in the amount $38,500, and is paid. Y's basis in the shares of stock is increased by a portion of the section 2056A estate tax paid determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22AU95.007</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Y's basis in the stock is $50,000 plus $11,000, or $61,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are effective for gifts made after August 22, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment as adjustment to basis. Any increase in basis under section 1015(d) and this section shall, for purposes of section 1016(b) (relating to adjustments to a substituted basis), be treated as an adjustment under section 1016(a) to the basis of the donee's property to which such increase applies. See paragraph (p) of Sec. 1.1016-5.
