                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)-(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On January 12, 1988, Indiana'a Office of Air Management (OAM),  Indiana Department of Environmental Management, agreed to review all  relevant hood designs and performance guidance to determine which  criteria to use in determining ongoing compliance with the capture  efficiency provisions in 326 IAC 15-1 for Quemetco, Inc., and Refined  Metals. Because these efficiencies are closely related to equipment  design, OAM believes that a review of the process and control equipment  designs and operating paramenters should provide the necessary  determination of compliance. OAM will work with the Indianapolis local  agency, the Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Division, on viable  alternatives and will keep USEPA up to date on its progress. OAM  anticipates that specific criteria for determining compliance will be  incorporated into the sources' operation permits (and forwarded to USEPA  for informational purposes), and, should the opportunity arise, 326 IAC  15-1 will be revised to similarly incorporate capture efficiency  criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On March 2, 2000, Indiana submitted a maintenance plan for  Marion County as part of its request to redesignate the County to  attainment of the lead standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On April 1, 2009, Indiana submitted an updated maintenance plan  under section 175A of the CAA for Marion County for the continued  attainment of the 1.5 [micro]g/m\3\ lead standard.
