                                Sec. 30.11  Q-11: Are TARP recipients required to meet any other standards in section 111 of EESA?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Approval of compensation payments to, and compensation structures for, certain employees of TARP recipients receiving exceptional financial assistance. For any period during which a TARP recipient is designated as a TARP recipient that has received exceptional financial assistance, the TARP recipient must obtain the approval by the Special Master of all compensation payments to, and compensation structures for, SEOs and most highly compensated employees subject to paragraph (b) of Sec. 30.10 (Q-10). TARP recipients that receive exceptional financial assistance must also receive approval by the Special Master for all compensation structures for other employees who are executive officers (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act, Rule 3b-7) or one of the 100 most highly compensated employees of a TARP recipient receiving exceptional assistance (or both), who are not subject to the bonus limitations under Sec. 30.10 (Q-10). For this purpose, compensation payments and compensation structures may include awards or other rights to compensation which an employee has already received but not yet been paid or, in some instances, fully accrued. Accordingly, the Special Master has the authority to require that such compensation payments or compensation structures be altered to meet the standards set forth in Sec. 30.16 (Q-16). However, this approval requirement is not applicable to payments that are not subject to paragraph (a) of Sec. 30.10 (Q-10) due to the application of paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 30.10 (Q-10) or the effective date provisions of Sec. 30.17 (Q-17), though the Special Master will take such payments into account in reviewing the compensation structure and amounts payable, as applicable, that are subject to review. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, approval is not required with respect to an employee not subject to the bonus payment limitations to the extent that the employee's annual compensation, as modified

in Sec. 30.16 (Q-16) to include certain deferred compensation and pension accruals but to disregard any grant of long-term restricted stock, is limited to $500,000 or less, and any further compensation is provided in the form of long-term restricted stock. For details, see Sec. 30.16 (Q-16).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Perquisite disclosure--(1) General rule. TARP recipients must annually disclose during the TARP period any perquisite whose total value for the TARP recipient's fiscal year exceeds $25,000 for each of the SEOs and most highly compensated employees that are subject to paragraph (a) of Sec. 30.10 (Q-10). TARP recipients must provide a narrative description of the amount and nature of these perquisites, the recipient of these perquisites, and a justification for offering these perquisites (including a justification for offering the perquisite, and not only for offering the perquisite with a value that exceeds $25,000). Such disclosure must be provided within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year any part of which is a TARP period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Location. A TARP recipient must provide this disclosure to Treasury and to its primary regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compensation consultant disclosure--(1) General rule. The compensation committee of the TARP recipient must provide annually a narrative description of whether the TARP recipient, the board of directors of the TARP recipient, or the compensation committee has engaged a compensation consultant; and all types of services, including non-compensation related services, the compensation consultant or any of its affiliates has provided to the TARP recipient, the board, or the compensation committee during the past three years, including any ``benchmarking'' or comparisons employed to identify certain percentile levels of compensation (for example, entities used for benchmarking and a justification for using these entities and the lowest percentile level proposed for compensation). Such disclosure must be provided within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year any part of which is a TARP period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to TARP recipients not required to maintain compensation committees. For those TARP recipients not required to establish and maintain compensation committees under Sec. 30.4(c) (Q-4), the board of directors must provide the disclosure under Sec. 30.4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Location. A TARP recipient must provide this disclosure to Treasury and to its primary regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibition on gross-ups. Except as explicitly permitted under this part, TARP recipients are prohibited from providing (formally or informally) gross-ups to any of the SEOs and next twenty most highly compensated employees during the TARP period. For this purpose, providing a gross-up includes providing a right to a payment of such a gross-up at a future date, for example a date after the TARP period.</p>
