                            <p class="depth0">A TIA is a special type of assistance instrument used to increase  involvement of commercial firms in the DOE research, development and  demonstration (RD&D;) programs. A TIA, like a cooperative agreement,  requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management  aspects of the project. A TIA may be either a type of cooperative  agreement or a type of assistance transaction other than a cooperative  agreement, depending on the intellectual property provisions. A TIA is  either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A type of cooperative agreement with more flexible provisions  tailored for involving commercial firms (as distinct from a cooperative  agreement subject to all of the requirements in 10 CFR Part 600), but  with intellectual property provisions in full compliance   with the DOE intellectual property statutes (i.e., Bayh-Dole statute and  42 U.S.C. Secs. 2182 and 5908, as implemented in 10 CFR 600.325); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, if  its intellectual property provisions vary from the Bayh-Dole statute and  42 U.S.C. Secs. 2182 and 5908, which require the Government to retain  certain intellectual property rights, and require differing treatment  between large businesses and nonprofit organizations or small  businesses.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 603--Applicable Federal Statutes, Executive</p><p class="depth2">Orders, and Government-wide Regulations</p><p class="depth2">Whether the TIA is a cooperative agreement or a type of assistance  transaction other than a cooperative agreement, the terms and conditions  of the agreement must provide for recipients' compliance with applicable  Federal statutes, Executive Orders and Government-wide regulations. This  appendix lists some of the more common requirements to aid in  identifying ones that apply to a specific TIA. The list is not intended  to be all-inclusive, however; the contracting officer may need to  consult legal counsel to verify whether there are others that apply  (e.g., due to a provision in the appropriations act for the specific  funds in use or due to a statute or rule that applies to a particular  program or type of activity).</p><p class="depth2">A. Certifications</p><p class="depth2">All financial assistance applicants, including applicants requesting  a TIA must comply with the prohibitions concerning lobbying in a  Government-wide common rule that the DOE has codified at 10 CFR part  601. The ``List of Certifications and Assurances for SF 424(R&R;)'' on  the DOE Applicant and Recipient page at http://grants.pr.doe.gov  includes the Government-wide certification that must be provided with a  proposal for a financial assistance award, including a TIA.</p><p class="depth2">B. Assurances That Apply to a TIA</p><p class="depth2">Currently the DOE approach to communicating Federal statutes,  Executive Orders and Government-wide regulations is to provide potential  applicants a list of ``National Policies Assurances to be Incorporated  as Award Terms'' in the program announcement (This list is available on  the Applicant and Recipient Page at http://grants.pr.doe.gov under Award  Terms). The contracting officer should follow this approach for  announcements that allow for the award of a TIA. The contracting officer  should normally incorporate by reference or attach the list of national  policy assurances to a TIA award. Of these requirements, the following  four assurances apply to all TIA:</p><p class="depth2">1. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of race, color, or  national origin in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.  2000d, et seq.) as implemented by DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1040.  These apply to all financial assistance. They require recipients to flow  down the prohibitions to any subrecipients performing a part of the  substantive RD&D; program (as opposed to suppliers from whom recipients  purchase goods or services).</p><p class="depth2">2. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of age, in the Age  Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101, et seq.) as implemented by  DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1040. They apply to all financial  assistance and require flow down to subrecipients.</p><p class="depth2">3. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of handicap, in  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) as  implemented by DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1041. They apply to all  financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients.</p><p class="depth2">4. Preferences for use of U.S.-flag air carriers in the  International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974  (49 U.S.C. 40118), which apply to uses of U.S. Government funds.</p><p class="depth2">C. Other Assurances</p><p class="depth2">Additional assurance requirements may apply in certain  circumstances, as follows:</p><p class="depth2">1. If construction work is to be done under a TIA or its subawards,  it is subject to the prohibitions in Executive Order 11246 on  discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national  origin.</p><p class="depth2">2. If the RD&D; involves human subjects or animals, it is subject to  the requirements codified by the Department of Health and Human Services  at 45 CFR part 46 and implemented by DOE at 10 CFR part 745 and rules on  animal acquisition, transport, care, handling and use in 9 CFR parts 1  through 4, Department of Agriculture rules and rules of the Department  of Interior at 50 CFR parts 10 through 24 and Commerce at 50 CFR parts  217 through 277, respectively. See item a. or b., respectively, under  the heading ``Live organisms'' included on the DOE ``National Policy  Assurances To Be Incorporated As Award Terms'' on the Applicant and  Recipient Page.</p><p class="depth2">3. If the RD&D; involves actions that may affect the environment, it  is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, and may also be  subject to national policy requirements for flood-prone areas, coastal  zones, coastal barriers, wild and scenic rivers, and underground sources  of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2">4. If the project may impact a historic property, it is subject to  the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.).</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix B to Part 603--Flow Down Requirements for Purchases of</p><p class="depth2">Goods and Services</p><p class="depth2">A. As discussed in Sec. 603.705, the contracting officer must inform  recipients of any requirements that flow down to their purchases of  goods or services (e.g., supplies or equipment) under their TIA. Note  that purchases of goods or services differ from subawards, which are for  substantive RD&D; program performance.</p><p class="depth2">B. Appendix A to 10 CFR part 600, subpart D lists eight requirements  that commonly apply to firms' purchases under grants or cooperative  agreements. Of those eight, two that apply to all recipients' purchases  under a TIA are:</p><p class="depth2">1. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352). A contractor  submitting a bid to the recipient for a contract award of $100,000 or  more must file a certification with the recipient that it has not and  will not use Federal appropriations for certain lobbying purposes. The  contractor also must disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that  takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. For further  details, see 10 CFR part 601, the DOE's codification of the Government- wide common rule implementing this amendment.</p><p class="depth2">2. Debarment and suspension. Recipients may not make contract awards  that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $100,000)  and certain other contract awards may not be made to parties listed on  the General Services Administration (GSA) ``List of Parties Excluded  from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.'' The GSA list  contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded  by agencies, and parties declared ineligible under statutory or  regulatory authority other than Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR, 1986  Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235). For further  details, see subparts A through E of 10 CFR part 606, which is the DOE's  codification of the Government-wide common rule implementing Executive  Orders 12549 and 12689.</p><p class="depth2">C. One other requirement applies only in cases where construction  work is to be performed under the TIA with Federal funds or recipient  funds counted toward required cost sharing:</p><p class="depth2">1. Equal Employment Opportunity. If the TIA includes construction  work, the contracting officer should inform the recipient that  Department of Labor regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) prescribe a clause  that must be incorporated into construction awards and subawards.  Further details are provided in Appendix B to 10 CFR 600 subpart D, item  1.</p>
