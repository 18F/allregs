Mode of travel designated shall  be reasonable and consistent with accepted, conventional, contemporary  modes of travel in said vicinity. Use will be consistent with reasonable  purposes for which such land is held. The Director will issue such  permits as are necessary for access, designating the means and route of  travel for ingress and degress so as to preserve the wilderness  character of the area.
