This paragraph applies to persons operating an aircraft under part 121, 125, 129, or 135 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise authorized by the FAA, no pilot may takeoff from a civil airport under IFR unless the weather conditions at time of takeoff are at or above the weather minimums for IFR takeoff prescribed for that airport under part 97 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If takeoff weather minimums are not prescribed under part 97 of this

chapter for a particular airport, the following weather minimums apply to takeoffs under IFR:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For aircraft, other than helicopters, having two engines or less--1 statute mile visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For aircraft having more than two engines--\1/2\ statute mile visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For helicopters--\1/2\ statute mile visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, no pilot may takeoff under IFR from a civil airport having published obstacle departure procedures (ODPs) under part 97 of this chapter for the takeoff runway to be used, unless the pilot uses such ODPs or an alternative procedure or route assigned by air traffic control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, no pilot may takeoff from an airport under IFR unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For part 121 and part 135 operators, the pilot uses a takeoff obstacle clearance or avoidance procedure that ensures compliance with the applicable airplane performance operating limitations requirements under part 121, subpart I or part 135, subpart I for takeoff at that airport; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For part 129 operators, the pilot uses a takeoff obstacle clearance or avoidance procedure that ensures compliance with the airplane performance operating limitations prescribed by the State of the operator for takeoff at that airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Military airports. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Administrator, each person operating a civil aircraft under IFR into or out of a military airport shall comply with the instrument approach procedures and the takeoff and landing minimum prescribed by the military authority having jurisdiction of that airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Comparable values of RVR and ground visibility. (1) Except for Category II or Category III minimums, if RVR minimums for takeoff or landing are prescribed in an instrument approach procedure, but RVR is not reported for the runway of intended operation, the RVR minimum shall be converted to ground visibility in accordance with the table in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and shall be the visibility minimum for takeoff or landing on that runway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except for Category II or Category III minimums, if RVR minimums for takeoff or landing are prescribed in an instrument approach procedure, but RVR is not reported for the runway of intended operation, the RVR minimum shall be converted to ground visibility in accordance with the table in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and shall be the visibility minimum for takeoff or landing on that runway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>

When radar is approved at certain locations for ATC purposes, it may be used not only for surveillance and precision radar approaches, as applicable, but also may be used in conjunction with instrument approach procedures predicated on other types of radio navigational aids. Radar vectors may be authorized to provide course guidance through the segments of an approach to the final course or fix. When operating on an unpublished route or while being radar vectored, the pilot, when an approach clearance is received, shall, in addition to complying with Sec. 91.177, maintain the last altitude assigned to that pilot until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. After the aircraft is so established, published altitudes apply to descent within each succeeding route or approach segment unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. Upon reaching the final approach course or fix, the pilot may either complete the instrument approach in accordance with a procedure approved for the facility or continue a surveillance or precision radar approach to a landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Limitation on procedure turns. In the case of a radar vector to a final approach course or fix, a timed approach from a holding fix, or an approach for which the procedure specifies ``No PT,'' no pilot may make a procedure turn unless cleared to do so by ATC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> ILS components. The basic components of an ILS are the localizer, glide

slope, and outer marker, and, when installed for use with Category II or Category III instrument approach procedures, an inner marker. The following means may be used to substitute for the outer marker: Compass locator; precision approach radar (PAR) or airport surveillance radar (ASR); DME, VOR, or nondirectional beacon fixes authorized in the standard instrument approach procedure; or a suitable RNAV system in conjunction with a fix identified in the standard instrument approach procedure. Applicability of, and substitution for, the inner marker for a Category II or III approach is determined by the appropriate 14 CFR part 97 approach procedure, letter of authorization, or operations specifications issued to an operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Approach to straight-in landing operations below DH, or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS). For straight-in instrument approach procedures other than Category II or Category III, no pilot operating under this section or Sec. Sec. 121.651, 125.381, and 135.225 of this chapter may operate an aircraft at any airport below the authorized MDA or continue an approach below the authorized DH and land unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and, for operations conducted under part 121 or part 135 of this chapter, the descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The pilot determines that the enhanced flight visibility observed by use of a certified enhanced flight vision system is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following visual references for the intended runway are distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot using the enhanced flight vision system:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The approach light system (if installed); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following visual references in both paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The runway threshold, identified by at least one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The beginning of the runway landing surface;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The threshold lights; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The runway end identifier lights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The touchdown zone, identified by at least one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The runway touchdown zone landing surface;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The touchdown zone lights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The touchdown zone markings; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The runway lights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation of the runway of intended landing and below that altitude, the flight visibility must be sufficient for the following to be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot without reliance on the enhanced flight vision system to continue to a landing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lights or markings of the threshold; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The lights or markings of the touchdown zone;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The pilot(s) is qualified to use an EFVS as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For parts 119 and 125 certificate holders, the applicable training, testing and qualification provisions of parts 121, 125, and 135 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For foreign persons, in accordance with the requirements of the civil aviation authority of the State of the operator; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For persons conducting any other operation, in accordance with the applicable currency and proficiency requirements of part 61 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For parts 119 and 125 certificate holders, and part 129 operations specifications holders, their operations specifications authorize use of EFVS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The aircraft is equipped with, and the pilot uses, an enhanced flight vision system, the display of which is suitable for maneuvering the aircraft and has either an FAA type design approval or, for a foreign-registered aircraft, the EFVS complies with all of the EFVS requirements of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> For purposes of this section, ``enhanced flight vision system'' (EFVS) is an installed airborne system comprised of the following features and characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An electronic means to provide a display of the forward external scene topography (the natural or manmade features of a place or region especially
