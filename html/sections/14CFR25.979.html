                            <p class="depth0">For pressure fueling systems, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each pressure fueling system fuel manifold connection must have means to prevent the escape of hazardous quantities of fuel from the system if the fuel entry valve fails.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An automatic shutoff means must be provided to prevent the quantity of fuel in each tank from exceeding the

maximum quantity approved for that tank. This means must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allow checking for proper shutoff operation before each fueling of the tank; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide indication at each fueling station of failure of the shutoff means to stop the fuel flow at the maximum quantity approved for that tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A means must be provided to prevent damage to the fuel system in the event of failure of the automatic shutoff means prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The airplane pressure fueling system (not including fuel tanks and fuel tank vents) must withstand an ultimate load that is 2.0 times the load arising from the maximum pressures, including surge, that is likely to occur during fueling. The maximum surge pressure must be established with any combination of tank valves being either intentionally or inadvertently closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The airplane defueling system (not including fuel tanks and fuel tank vents) must withstand an ultimate load that is 2.0 times the load arising from the maximum permissible defueling pressure (positive or negative) at the airplane fueling connection.
