                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General applicability of an AEDM. A manufacturer of covered products or covered equipment explicitly authorized to use an AEDM in Sec. Sec. 429.14 through 429.54 may not distribute any basic model of such equipment in commerce unless the manufacturer has determined the energy efficiency of the basic model, either from testing the basic model in conjunction with DOE's certification sampling plans and statistics or from applying an alternative method for determining energy efficiency or energy use (AEDM) to the basic model, in accordance with the requirements of this section. In instances where a manufacturer has tested a basic model, the manufacturer may not knowingly use an AEDM to overrate the efficiency (or underrate the consumption) of the model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Testing. Testing for each covered product or covered equipment must be done in accordance with the sampling plan provisions established in Sec. 429.11 and the testing procedures in parts 430 and 431 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) for commercial HVAC (includes commercial warm air furnaces and commercial packaged boilers), WH, and refrigeration equipment--(1) Criteria an AEDM must satisfy. A manufacturer may not apply an AEDM to a basic model to determine its efficiency pursuant to this section unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The AEDM is derived from a mathematical model that estimates the energy efficiency or energy consumption characteristics of the basic model as measured by the applicable DOE test procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AEDM is based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of performance data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer has validated the AEDM, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section with basic models that meet the current Federal energy conservation standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Validation of an AEDM. Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must validate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer must select at least the minimum number of basic models for each validation class specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section to which the particular AEDM applies. Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or efficiency for each of the selected basic models. Test a single unit of each selected basic model in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Compare the results from the single unit test and the AEDM energy use or efficiency output according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AEDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Individual model tolerances. (A) For those covered products with an energy-efficiency metric, the predicted efficiency for each model calculated by applying the AEDM may not be more than five percent greater than the efficiency determined from the corresponding test of the model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For those covered products with an energy-consumption metric, the predicted energy consumption for each model, calculated by applying the AEDM, may not be more than five percent less than the energy consumption

determined from the corresponding test of the model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For all covered products, the predicted energy efficiency or consumption for each model calculated by applying the AEDM must meet or exceed the applicable federal energy conservation performance standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional test unit requirements. (A) Each AEDM must be supported by test data obtained from physical tests of current models; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Test results used to validate the AEDM must meet or exceed current, applicable Federal standards as specified in part 431 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each test must have been performed in accordance with the DOE test procedure specified in parts 430 or 431 of this chapter or test procedure waiver for which compliance is required at the time the basic model is distributed in commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Validation classes.

However, manufacturers do</p><p class="depth0">not need to include all types of these models if it will increase the</p><p class="depth0">minimum number of tests that need to be conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> AEDM records retention requirements. If a manufacturer has used an AEDM to determine representative values pursuant to this section, the manufacturer must have available upon request for inspection by the Department records showing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The AEDM, including the mathematical model, the engineering or statistical analysis, and/or computer simulation or modeling that is the basis of the AEDM;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Product information, complete test data, AEDM calculations, and the statistical comparisons from the units tested that were used to validate the AEDM pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Product information and AEDM calculations for each basic model to which the AEDM has been applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional AEDM requirements. If requested by the Department and at DOE's discretion, the manufacturer must perform at least one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conduct simulations before representatives of the Department to predict the performance of particular basic models of the product to which the AEDM was applied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide analyses of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct certification testing of basic models selected by the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> AEDM verification testing. DOE may use the test data for a given individual model generated pursuant to Sec. 429.104 to verify the certified rating determined by an AEDM as long as the following process is followed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selection of units. DOE will obtain units for test from retail, where available. If units cannot be obtained from retail, DOE will request that a unit be provided by the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lab requirements. DOE will conduct testing at an independent, third-party testing facility of its choosing. In cases where no third-party laboratory is capable of testing the equipment, it may be tested at a manufacturer's facility upon DOE's request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturer participation. (A) Except when testing variable refrigerant flow systems (which are governed by the rules found at Sec. 431.96(f)), testing will be completed without a manufacturer representative on-site. In limited instances further described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, a manufacturer and DOE representative may be present to witness the test set-up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A manufacturer's representative may request to be on-site to witness the test set-up if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The installation manual for the basic model specifically requires it to be started only by a factory-trained installer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer has elected, as part of the certification of that basic model, to have the opportunity to witness the test set-up. A manufacturer may elect to witness the test set-up for the initial verification test for no more than 10 percent of the manufacturer's basic models submitted for certification and rated with an AEDM per validation class specified in section (c)(2)(iv) of this paragraph. The 10-percent limit applies to all of the eligible basic models submitted for certification by a given manufacturer no matter how many AEDMs a manufacturer has used to develop its ratings. The 10-percent limit is determined by first calculating 10 percent of the total number of basic models rated with an AEDM per validation class, and then truncating the resulting product. Manufacturers who have submitted fewer than 10 basic models rated with an AEDM for certification may elect to have the opportunity to witness the test set-up of one basic model. A manufacturer must identify the basic models it wishes to witness as part of its certification report(s) prior to the basic model being selected for verification testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In those instances in which a manufacturer has not provided the required information as specified in Sec. 429.12(b)(13) for a given basic model that has been rated and certified as compliant with the applicable standards, a manufacturer is precluded from witnessing the testing set up for that basic model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A DOE representative will be present for the test set-up in all cases where a manufacturer representative requests to be on-site for the test set-up. The manufacturer's representative

cannot communicate with a lab representative outside of the DOE representative's presence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If DOE has obtained through retail channels a unit for test that meets either of the conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer that the basic model was selected for testing and that the manufacturer may have a representative present for the test set-up. If the manufacturer does not respond within five calendar days of receipt of that notification, the manufacturer waives the option to be present for test set-up, and DOE will proceed with the test set-up without a manufacturer's representative present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If DOE has obtained directly from the manufacturer a unit for test that meets either of the conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer of the option to be present for the test set-up at the time the unit is purchased. DOE will specify the date (not less than five calendar days) by which the manufacturer must notify DOE whether a manufacturer's representative will be present. If the manufacturer does not notify DOE by the date specified, the manufacturer waives the option to be present for the test set-up, and DOE will proceed with the test set-up without a manufacturer's representative present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> DOE will review the certification submissions from the manufacturer that were on file as of the date DOE purchased a basic model (under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(D) of this section) or the date DOE notifies the manufacturer that the basic model has been selected for testing (under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(E) of this section) to determine if the manufacturer has indicated that it intends to witness the test set-up of the selected basic model. DOE will also verify that the manufacturer has not exceeded the allowable limit of witness testing selections as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2) of this section. If DOE discovers that the manufacturer exceeded the limits specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2), DOE will notify the manufacturer of this fact and deny its request to be present for the test set-up of the selected basic model. The manufacturer must update its certification submission to ensure it has not exceeded the allowable limit of witness testing selections as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2) to be present at set-up for future selections. At this time DOE will also review the supplemental PDF submission(s) for the selected basic model to determine that all necessary information has been provided to the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If DOE determines, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, that the model should be tested at the manufacturer's facility, a DOE representative will be present on site to observe the test set-up and testing with the manufacturer's representative. All testing will be conducted at DOE's direction, which may include DOE-contracted personnel from a third-party lab, as well as the manufacturer's technicians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> As further explained in paragraph (c)(5)(v)(B) of this section, if a manufacturer's representative is present for the initial test set-up for any reason, the manufacturer forfeits any opportunity to request a retest of the basic model. Furthermore, if the manufacturer requests to be on-site for test set-up pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section but is not present on site, the manufacturer forfeits any opportunity to request a retest of the basic model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Testing. At no time during verification testing may the lab and the manufacturer communicate without DOE authorization. All verification testing will be conducted in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure, as well as each of the following to the extent that they apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any active test procedure waivers that have been granted for the basic model;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any test procedure guidance that has been issued by DOE;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The installation and operations manual that is shipped with the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any additional information that was provided by the manufacturer at the time of certification (prior to DOE obtaining the unit for test); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If during test set-up or testing, the lab indicates to DOE that it needs additional information regarding a given basic model in order to test in accordance with the applicable DOE

test procedure, DOE may organize a meeting between DOE, the manufacturer and the lab to provide such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Failure to meet certified rating. If a model tests worse than its certified rating by an amount exceeding the tolerance prescribed in paragraph (c)(5)(vi) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer. DOE will provide the manufacturer with all documentation related to the test set up, test conditions, and test results for the unit. Within the timeframe allotted by DOE, the manufacturer may then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Present all claims regarding testing validity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the manufacturer was not on site for the initial test set-up, request a retest of the previously tested unit with manufacturer and DOE representatives on-site for the test set-up. DOE will not conduct the retest using a different unit of the same basic model unless DOE and the manufacturer determine it is necessary based on the test results, claims presented, and DOE regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tolerances. (A) For consumption metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be less than or equal to the certified rating x (1 + the applicable tolerance).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For efficiency metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be greater than or equal to the certified rating x (1 - the applicable tolerance).

The basis of the ARM referred to in Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(ii) for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps must be a representation of the test data and calculations of a mechanical vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. The major components in the refrigeration cycle must be modeled as ``fits'' to manufacturer performance data or by graphical or tabular performance data. Heat transfer characteristics of coils may be modeled as a function of face area, number of rows, fins per inch, refrigerant circuitry, air-flow rate and entering-air enthalpy. Additional performance-related characteristics to be

considered may include type of expansion device, refrigerant flow rate through the expansion device, power of the indoor fan and cyclic-degradation coefficient. Ratings for untested combinations must be derived from the ratings of a combination tested in accordance with Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(i). The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and/or heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) ratings for an untested combination must be set equal to or less than the lower of the SEER and/or HSPF calculated using the applicable DOE-approved alternative rating method (ARM). If the method includes an ARM/simulation adjustment factor(s), determine the value(s) of the factors(s) that yield the best match between the SEER/HSPF determined using the ARM versus the SEER/HSPF determined from testing in accordance with Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(i). Thereafter, apply the ARM using the derived adjustment factor(s) only when determining the ratings for untested combinations having the same outdoor unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Approval of an ARM. (i) Manufacturers who elect to use an ARM for determining measures of energy consumption under Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section must submit a request for DOE to review the ARM. Send the request to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Program (EE-2J), Attention: Alternative Rating Methods (ARM) for Certification and Compliance, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each request to DOE for approval of an ARM must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address of the official representing the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Complete documentation of the alternative rating method to allow DOE to evaluate its technical adequacy. The documentation must include a description of the methodology, state any underlying assumptions, and explain any correlations. The documentation should address how the method accounts for the cyclic-degradation coefficient, the type of expansion device, and, if applicable, the indoor fan-off delay. The requestor must submit any computer programs--including spreadsheets--having less than 200 executable lines that implement the ARM. Longer computer programs must be identified and sufficiently explained, as specified above, but their inclusion in the initial submittal package is optional. Applicability or limitations of the ARM (e.g., only covers single-speed units when operating in the cooling mode, covers units with rated capacities of 3 tons or less, not applicable to the manufacturer's product line of non-ducted systems) must be stated in the documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Complete test data from laboratory tests on four mixed (i.e., non-highest-sales-volume combination) systems per each ARM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The four mixed systems must include four different indoor units and at least two different outdoor units. A particular model of outdoor unit may be tested with up to two of the four indoor units. The four systems must include two low-capacity mixed systems and two high-capacity mixed systems. The low-capacity mixed systems may have any capacity. The rated capacity of each high-capacity mixed system must be at least a factor of two higher than its counterpart low-capacity mixed system. The four mixed systems must meet the applicable energy conservation standard in Sec. 430.32(c) in effect at the time of the rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The four indoor units must come from at least two different coil families, with a maximum of two indoor units coming from the same coil family. Data for two indoor units from the same coil family, if submitted, must come from testing with one of the ``low-capacity mixed systems'' and one of the ``high-capacity mixed systems.'' A mixed system indoor coil may come from the same coil family as the highest-sales-volume-combination indoor unit (i.e., the ``matched'' indoor unit) for the particular outdoor unit. Data on mixed systems where the indoor unit is now obsolete will be accepted towards the ARM-validation submittal requirement if it is from the same coil family as other indoor units still in production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The first two sentences of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C)(2) of this section do

not apply if the manufacturer offers indoor units from only one coil family. In this case only, all four indoor coils must be selected from this one coil family. If approved, the ARM will be specifically limited to applications for this one coil family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All product information on each mixed system indoor unit, each matched system indoor unit, and each outdoor unit needed to implement the proposed ARM. The calculated ratings for the four mixed systems, as determined using the proposed ARM, must be provided along with any other related information that will aid the verification process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If request for approval is for an updated ARM, manufacturers must identify modifications made to the ARM since the last submittal, including any ARM/simulation adjustment factor(s) added since the ARM was last approved by DOE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approval must be received from the Department to use the ARM before the ARM may be used for rating split-system central air conditioners and heat pumps. If a manufacturer has a DOE-approved ARM for products also distributed in commerce by a private labeler, the ARM may also be used by the private labeler for rating these products. Once an ARM is approved, DOE may contact a manufacturer to learn if their ARM has been modified in any way and to verify that the ARM is being applied as approved. DOE will give follow-up priority to individual combinations having questionably high ratings (e.g., a coil-only system having a rating that exceeds the rating of a coil-only highest sales volume combination by more than 6 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes to DOE's regulations requiring re-approval of an ARM. Manufacturers who elect to use an ARM for determining measures of energy consumption under Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section must submit a request for DOE to review the ARM when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DOE amends the energy conservation standards as specified in Sec. 430.32 for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps. In this case, any testing and evidence required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be developed with units that meet the amended energy conservation standards specified in Sec. 430.32. Re-approval for the ARM must be obtained before the compliance date of amended energy conservation standards. (ii) DOE amends the test procedure for residential air conditioners and heat pumps as specified in appendix M to subpart B of part 430. Re-approval for the ARM must be obtained before the compliance date of amended test procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturers that elect to use an ARM for determining measures of energy consumption under Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section must regularly either subject a sample of their units to independent testing, e.g., through a voluntary certification program, in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure, or have the representations reviewed by an independent state-registered professional engineer who is not an employee of the manufacturer. The manufacturer may continue to use the ARM only if the testing establishes, or the registered professional engineer certifies, that the results of the ARM accurately represent the energy consumption of the unit(s). Any proposed change to the alternative rating method must be approved by DOE prior to its use for rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Manufacturers who choose to use computer simulation or engineering analysis for determining measures of energy consumption under Sec. 429.16(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) and paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section must permit representatives of the Department of Energy to inspect for verification purposes the simulation method(s) and computer program(s) used. This inspection may include conducting simulations to predict the performance of particular outdoor unit ``indoor'' unit combinations specified by DOE, analysis of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) for walk-in refrigeration equipment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Criteria an AEDM must satisfy. A manufacturer may not apply an AEDM to a basic model to determine its efficiency pursuant to this section unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The AEDM is derived from a mathematical model that estimates

the energy efficiency or energy consumption characteristics of the basic model as measured by the applicable DOE test procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AEDM is based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, or other analytical evaluation of performance data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer has validated the AEDM, in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Validation of an AEDM. Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must validate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer must select at least the minimum number of basic models for each validation class specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section to which the particular AEDM applies. Test a single unit of each basic model in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or energy efficiency for each of the selected basic models. Compare the results from the single unit test and the AEDM output according to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and repeatability of the AEDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Individual model tolerances. (A) The predicted efficiency for each model calculated by applying the AEDM may not be more than five percent greater than the efficiency determined from the corresponding test of the model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The predicted energy efficiency for each model calculated by applying the AEDM must meet or exceed the applicable federal energy conservation standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional test unit requirements. (A) Each AEDM must be supported by test data obtained from physical tests of current models; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Test results used to validate the AEDM must meet or exceed current, applicable Federal standards as specified in part 431 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each test must have been performed in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure with which compliance is required at the time the basic model is distributed in commerce; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For rating WICF refrigeration system components, an AEDM may not simulate or model portions of the system that are not required to be tested by the DOE test procedure. That is, if the test results used to validate the AEDM are for either a unit cooler only or a condensing unit only, the AEDM must estimate the system rating using the nominal values specified in the DOE test procedure for the other part of the refrigeration system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> WICF refrigeration validation classes.

DOE may use the test data for a given individual model generated pursuant to Sec. 429.104 to verify the certified rating determined by an AEDM as long as the following process is followed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selection of units. DOE will obtain units for test from retail, where available. If units cannot be obtained from retail, DOE will request that a unit be provided by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lab requirements.
