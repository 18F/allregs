                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Applications shall be submitted to the Air Force DRB on  DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Dismissal from the  Armed Forces of the United States (OMB Approval No. 0704-0004) with such  other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the  applicant's advantage to submit such documents with the application or  within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the  case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DOD installations and  regional offices of the Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA  Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room  1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing. A motion or request for review must be made within 15  years after the date of discharge or dismissal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicant's responsibilities. An applicant may request a change  in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Character of discharge. DD Form 293 provides an applicant an  opportunity to request a specific change in character of discharge (for  example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Under Other Than  Honorable Conditions Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only  a person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level  status may request a change from other than an honorable discharge to  Entry Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does  not have an Honorable Discharge will be treated as a request for a  change to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a  specific change to another character of discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reason for discharge. DD Form 293 provides an applicant an  opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for discharge. If  an applicant does not request a specific change in the reason for  discharge, the DRB will presume that the request for review does not  involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under its  responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's  discharge, the DRB will change the reason for discharge if such a change  is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are  consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in ``Board  Action Requested'' of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a  difference between an applicant's issue and the requested action, the  DRB will respond   to the issue in the context of the action requested in ``Board Action  Requested.'' In the case of a Personal Appearance hearing, the DRB will  attempt to resolve the ambiguity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the member is deceased or mentally incompetent, the spouse,  next-of-kin, or legal representative may, as agent for the member,  submit the application for the review along with proof of the member's  death or mental incompetency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicants forward their requests for review to the USAF  Manpower and Personnel Center-mailing address: AFMPC/MPCDOA1, Randolph  AFB TX 78150. AFMPC will obtain all available military records of the  former members from the National Personnel Records Center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Withdrawal of application. An applicant shall be permitted to  withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the  scheduled review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Submission of issues on DD Form 293. Issues must be provided to  the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for  deliberation and should be submitted in accordance with the guidelines  of this subpart for submission of issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issues must be clear and specific. An issue must be stated  clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the  nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Separate listing of issues. Each issue submitted by an applicant  should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each  issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the  issue is conveyed to the DRB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of DD Form 293. DD Form 293 provides applicants with a  standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and  specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant,  provide a basis for changing the discharge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be  important by an applicant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted  by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a  decisional issue under Sec. 865.112, and those matters submitted simply  as background or supporting materials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that  the applicant later submits a complaint under Sec. 865.121 of this  subpart concerning the decisional document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an  applicant's issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Incorporation by reference. If the applicant makes an additional  written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the  applicant may incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the  written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The  reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the  matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the  page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the  applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early  as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly  urged to set forth all issues as a separate item at the beginning of the  brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently has  failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly  identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond  to such an issue in accordance with Secs. 865.111 and 865.112 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effective date of the new DD Form 293. With respect to  applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider  issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in  effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received  on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD  Form 293, the application will be returned with a copy of the revised DD  Form 293 for reaccomplishment. The DRB will only respond to the issues  submitted on the new form in accordance with 32 CFR part 70, 47 FR  37770, August 26, 1982 and this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Relationship of issues to character of or reason for discharge.  If the application applies to both character of and reason for  discharge, the applicant is   encouraged, but not required, to identify the issue as applying to the  character of or reason for discharge (or both). Unless the issue is  directed at the reason for discharge expressly or by necessary  implication, the DRB will presume that it applies solely to the  character of discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Relationship of issues to the standards for discharge review.  The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and  equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in Sec. 865.120 of  this subpart. The applicant is encouraged to review those standards  before submitting any issue upon which the applicant believes a change  in discharge should be based. The applicant is also encouraged, but not  required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the propriety or the  equity of the discharge. This will assist the DRB in assessing the  relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under Sec. 865.112(d)  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Citation of matter from decisions. The primary function of the  DRB involves the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis.  Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as the basis for a  change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring the DRB's  attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative material,  the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting documents.  If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an issue that  sets forth specific principles and facts from a specific cited decision,  the following requirements apply with respect to applications received  on or after November 27, 1982.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the  ``Applicant's Issue'' portion of DD Form 293.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB,  another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the  specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision  and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To insure timely consideration of principles cited from  unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces  Discharge Review Board/Correction Board Reading Room), the applicant  must provide the DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant  portion of treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles  were discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be  returned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements above,  the decisional document shall note the defect, and shall respond to the  issue without regard to the citation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Identification by the DRB of issues submitted by an applicant.  The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this  section after a review of all materials and information is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issues on DD Form 293. The DRB shall consider all items  submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated  therein) in accordance with this part. With respect to applications  submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider all issues  clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect  at the time of the submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amendment of issues. The DRB shall not request or instruct an  applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant.  Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be  confirmed in writing by the applicant. This provision does not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limit by DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the  meaning of such matter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Preclude the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon  such questions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Prevent the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter  any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prevent the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of  proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right  of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's  submission. The written information will state that the applicant's  decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used  against the applicant in the consideration of the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional Issues Identified During a Hearing. The following  additional   procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote the DRB's  understanding of an applicant's presentation. If before closing the  hearing for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant has  presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the FRB may so inform the  applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add  additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB  from developing its own decisional issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Notification of possible bar to benefits. Written notification  shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for  discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This  notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board  for Correction of Military Records or the Veterans Administration may  confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar to benefits based  upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, the following  applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for  the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's  normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.</p>
