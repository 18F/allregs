                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 339.7103, the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Security Requirements for Federal Information Technology Resources</p><p class="depth0">(January 2010)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This clause applies whether the entire contract or order (hereafter ``contract''), or portion thereof, includes information technology resources or services in which the Contractor has physical or logical (electronic) access to, or operates a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) system containing, information that directly supports HHS' mission. The term ``information technology (IT)'', as used in this clause, includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services) and related resources. This clause does not apply to national security systems as defined in FISMA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractor responsibilities. The Contractor is responsible for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Protecting Federal information and Federal information systems in order to ensure their--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Integrity, which means guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Confidentiality, which means preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information; and.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Availability, which means ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing security of any Contractor systems, and information contained therein, connected to an HHS network or operated by the Contractor, regardless of location, on behalf of HHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adopting, and implementing, at a minimum, the policies, procedures, controls, and standards of the HHS Information Security Program to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of Federal information and Federal information systems for which the Contractor is responsible under this contract or to which it may otherwise have access under this contract. The HHS Information Security Program is outlined in the HHS Information Security Program Policy, which is available on the HHS Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor security deliverables. In accordance with the timeframes specified, the Contractor shall prepare and submit the following security documents to the Contracting Officer for review, comment, and acceptance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> IT Security Plan (IT-SP)--due within 30 days after contract award. The IT-SP shall be consistent with, and further detail the approach to, IT security contained in the Contractor's bid or proposal that resulted in the award of this contract. The IT-SP shall describe the processes and procedures that the Contractor will follow to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract. If the IT-SP only applies to a portion of the contract, the Contractor shall specify those parts of the contract to which the IT-SP applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor's IT-SP shall comply with applicable Federal laws that include, but are not limited to, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 (Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347), and the following Federal and HHS policies and procedures:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, in form and content, and with any pertinent contract Statement of Work/Performance Work Statement (SOW/PWS) requirements. The IT-SP shall identify and document appropriate IT security controls consistent with the sensitivity of the information and the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. The Contractor shall review and update the IT-SP in accordance with NIST SP 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems and FIPS 200, on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> HHS-OCIO Information Systems Security and Privacy Policy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After resolution of any comments provided by the Government on the draft IT-SP, the Contracting Officer shall accept the IT-SP and incorporate the Contractor's final version into the contract for Contractor implementation and maintenance. On an annual basis, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer verification that the IT-SP remains valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> IT Risk Assessment (IT-RA)--due within 30 days after contract award. The IT-RA shall be consistent, in form and content, with NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, and any additions or augmentations described in the

HHS-OCIO Information Systems Security and Privacy Policy. After resolution of any comments provided by the Government on the draft IT-RA, the Contracting Officer shall accept the IT-RA and incorporate the Contractor's final version into the contract for Contractor implementation and maintenance. The Contractor shall update the IT-RA on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FIPS 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems Assessment (FIPS 199 Assessment)--due within 30 days after contract award. The FIPS 199 Assessment shall be consistent with the cited NIST standard.

The Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in performance of this contract to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability testing), investigation, and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, confidentiality, and availability, of HHS data or to the protection of information systems operated on behalf of HHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that require protection of Federal information and Federal information systems as described in paragraph (a) of this clause, including those subcontracts that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have physical or electronic access to HHS' computer systems, networks, or IT infrastructure; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use information systems to generate, store, process, or exchange data with HHS or on behalf of HHS, regardless of whether the data resides on a HHS or the Contractor's information system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contractor employment notice. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer when an employee either begins or terminates employment (or is no longer assigned to the HHS project under this contract), if that employee has, or had, access to HHS information systems or data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Document information. The Contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer for any documents, information, or forms necessary to comply with the requirements of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Contractor responsibilities upon physical completion of the contract.
