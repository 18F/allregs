Not more than 1.4 parts per million as  determined by the Gutzeit Method (AOAC method 25.020; for incorporation  by reference, see Sec. 21.6(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Color. White or orange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rosin content. None when tested by the following method: Add 20  ml of absolute alcohol or glacial acetic acid (m. p. 13[deg] to 15  [deg]C.) to 2 grams of the shellac and thoroughly dissolve. Add 100 ml  of petroleum ether and mix thoroughly. Add approximately 2 liters of  water and separate a portion of the ether layer (at least 50 ml) and  filter if cloudy. Evaporate the petroleum ether and test as follows:  Solution A--5 ml of phenol dissolved in 10 ml of carbon tetrachloride.  Solution B--1 ml of bromine dissolved in 4 ml of carbon tetrachloride.  To the residue obtained above add 2 ml of Solution A and transfer the  mixture to a porcelain spot plate, filling one cavity. Immediately fill  an adjacent cavity with solution B. Cover the plate with a watch glass  and observe any color formation in Solution A. A decided purple or deep  indigo blue color is an indication of the presence of rosin.  [T.D.
