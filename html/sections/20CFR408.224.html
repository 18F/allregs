We multiply the amount of the quarterly  payment by 4 and divide by 12 to determine the equivalent monthly  payment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Semi-annual payments. We multiply the amount of the semi-annual  payment by 2 and divide by 12 to determine the equivalent monthly  payment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lump sum payment. If the paying agency will not prorate the lump  sum to determine the monthly amount, we will compute the amount as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the payment is for a specific period. We divide the lump sum  by the number of months in the period for which the payment was made to  determine the equivalent monthly payment amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the payment is for a lifetime or for an unspecified period.  We divide the lump sum amount by your life expectancy in months at the  time the lump sum is paid.</p>
