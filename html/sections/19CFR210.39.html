If such a stay is ordered by the district court,  after the determination of the Commission becomes final and the stay is  dissolved, the Commission shall certify to the district court such  portions of the record of its proceeding as the district court may  request. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the in camera  record may be transmitted to a district court and be admissible in a  civil action, subject to such protective order as the district court  determines necessary, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1659.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To facilitate timely compliance with any court order requiring  the Commission to transmit all or part of   the record of its section 337 proceedings to the court, as described in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a party that requests the court to  issue an order staying the civil action or an order dissolving the stay  and directing the Commission to transmit all or part of the record to  the court must file written notice of the issuance or dissolution of a  stay with the Commission Secretary within 10 days of the issuance or  dissolution of a stay by the district court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In camera treatment of documents and testimony.

This shall not preclude references in  such proposed findings, briefs, or other papers to such documents or  testimony including generalized statements based on their contents. To  the extent that counsel consider it necessary to include specific  details of in camera data in their presentations, such data shall be  incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or other papers  marked ``Business Confidential,'' which shall be placed in camera and  become a part of the confidential record.
