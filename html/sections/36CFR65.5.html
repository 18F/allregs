                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Potential National Historic Landmarks are identified primarily by means of theme studies and in some instances by special studies. Nominations and recommendations made by the appropriate State officials, Federal Preservation Officers and other interested parties will be considered in scheduling and conducting studies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Theme studies. NPS defines and systematically conducts organized theme studies which encompass the major aspects of American history. The theme studies provide a contextual framework to evaluate the relative significance of historic properties and determine which properties meet National Historic Landmark criteria. Theme studies will be announced in advance through direct notice to appropriate State officials, Federal Preservation Officers and other interested parties and by notice in the Federal Register. Within the established thematic framework, NPS will schedule and conduct National Historic Landmark theme studies according to the following priorities. Themes which meet more of these priorities ordinarily will be studied before those which meet fewer of the priorities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Theme studies not yet begun as identified in ``History and Prehistory in the National Park System,'' 1982.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Theme studies in serious need of revision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Theme studies which relate to a significant number of properties listed in the National Register bearing opinions of State Historic Preservation Officers and Federal Preservation Officers that such properties are of potential national significance. (Only those recommendations which NPS determines are likely to meet the landmarks criteria will be enumerated in determining whether a significant number exists in a theme study.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Themes which reflect the broad planning needs of NPS and other Federal agencies and for which the funds to conduct the study are made available from sources other than the regularly programmed funds of the National Historic Landmarks Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special Studies. NPS will conduct special studies for historic properties

outside of active theme studies according to the following priorities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Studies authorized by Congress or mandated by Executive Order will receive the highest priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Properties which NPS determines are endangered and potentially meet the National Historic Landmarks criteria, whether or not the theme in which they are significant has been studied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Properties listed in the National Register bearing State or Federal agency recommendations of potential national significance where NPS concurs in the evaluation and the property is significant in a theme already studied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> When a property is selected for study to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark, NPS will notify in writing, except as provided below, (i) the owner(s), (ii) the chief elected local official, (iii) the appropriate State official, (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located, and, (v) if the property is on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, that it will be studied to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark. This notice will provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a property is selected for study to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark, NPS will notify in writing, except as provided below, (i) the owner(s), (ii) the chief elected local official, (iii) the appropriate State official, (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located, and, (v) if the property is on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, that it will be studied to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark. This notice will provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the property has more than 50 owners, NPS will notify in writing (i) the chief elected local official, (ii) the appropriate State official, (iii) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located, and, (iv) if the property is on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, and (v) provide general notice to the property owners. This general notice will be published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the potential National Historic Landmark is located and will provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation. The researcher will visit each property selected for study unless it is determined that an onsite investigation is not necessary. In the case of districts with more than 50 owners NPS may conduct a public information meeting if widespread public interest so warrants or on request by the chief elected local official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Properties for which a study was conducted before the effective date of these regulations are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The results of each study will be incorporated into a report which will contain at least</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A precise description of the property studied; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An analysis of the significance of the property and its relationship to the National Historic Landmark criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Properties appearing to qualify for designation as National Historic Landmarks will be presented to the Advisory Board for evaluation except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Properties appearing to qualify for designation as National Historic Landmarks will be presented to the Advisory Board for evaluation except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before the Advisory Board's review of a property, NPS will provide written notice of this review, except as provided below, and a copy of the study report to (i) the owner(s) of record; (ii) the appropriate State official; (iii) the chief elected local official; (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located; and, (v) if the property is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe. The list of owners shall be obtained from official land or tax record, whichever is most appropriate, within 90 days prior to the notification of intent to submit to the Advisory Board. If in any State the land or tax record is not the appropriate list an alternative source of owners may be used. NPS is responsible for notifying only those owners whose names appear on the list. Where there is more than one owner on the list each separate owner shall be notified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a property with more than 50 owners, NPS will notify, in writing, (i) the appropriate State official; (ii) the chief elected local official; (iii) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located; (iv) if the property is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe; and, (v) will provide general notice to the property owners.

The general notice will be published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the property is located. A copy of the study report will be made available on request. Notice of Advisory Board review will also be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice of Advisory Board review will be given at least 60 days in advance of the Advisory Board meeting. The notice will state date, time and location of the meeting; solicit written comments and recommendations on the study report; provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation and provide the owners of private property not more than 60 days in which to concur in or object in writing to the designation. Notice of Advisory Board meetings and the agenda will also be published in the Federal Register. Interested parties are encouraged to submit written comments and recommendations which will be presented to the Advisory Board. Interested parties may also attend the Advisory Board meeting and upon request will be given an opportunity to address the Board concerning a property's significance, integrity and proposed boundaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon notification, any owner of private property who wishes to object shall submit to the Chief, History Division, a notarized statement that the party is the sole or partial owner of record of the property, as appropriate, and objects to the designations. Such notice shall be submitted during the 60-day commenting period. Upon receipt of notarized objections respecting a district or an individual property with multiple ownership it is the responsibility of NPS to ascertain whether a majority of owners have so objected. If an owner whose name did not appear on the list certifies in a written notarized statement that the party is the sole or partial owner of a nominated private property such owner shall be counted by NPS in determining whether a majority of owners has objected. Each owner of private property in a district has one vote regardless of how many properties or what part of one property that party owns and regardless of whether the property contributes to the significance of the district.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The commenting period following notification can be waived only when all property owners and the chief elected local official have agreed in writing to the waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> The Advisory Board evaluates such factors as a property's significance, integrity, proposed boundaries and the professional adequacy of the study. If the Board finds that these conditions are met, it may recommend to the Secretary that a property be designated or declared eligible for designation as a National Historic Landmark. If one or more of the conditions are not met, the Board may recommend that the property not be designated a landmark or that consideration of it be deferred for further study, as appropriate. In making its recommendation, the Board shall state, if possible, whether or not it finds that the criteria of the landmarks program have been met. A simple majority is required to make a recommendation of designation. The Board's recommendations are advisory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Advisory Board evaluates such factors as a property's significance, integrity, proposed boundaries and the professional adequacy of the study.

In such instances, if a property appears to qualify for designation, NPS will provide notice and a copy of the study report to the parties as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section and will provide at least 30 days in which to submit written comments and to provide an opportunity for owners to concur in or object to the designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Director reviews the study report and the Advisory Board recommendations, certifies that the procedural requirements set forth in this section have been met and transmits the study reports, the recommendations of the Advisory Board, his recommendations and any other recommendations and comments received pertaining to the properties to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Secretary reviews the nominations, recommendations and any comments and, based on the criteria

set forth herein, makes a decision on National Historic Landmark designation.

A property determined eligible for National Historic Landmark designation is determined eligible for the National Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of National Historic Landmark designation, National Register listing, or a determination of eligibility will be sent in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.
