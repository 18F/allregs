Sec. 58.25-1 through 58.25-80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On each tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or over, the main  steering gear must comprise two or more identical power units that  comply with Sec. 58.25-10(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or over constructed on or  after September 1, 1984, must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The main steering gear must be arranged so that, in case of loss  of steering capability due to a single failure in any part of the power  actuating system of the main steering gear, excluding seizure of a  rudder actuator or failure of the tiller, quadrant, or components  serving the same purpose, steering capability can be regained not more  than 45 seconds after the loss of one power actuating system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The main steering gear must include either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two separate and independent power actuating systems, complying  with Sec. 58.25-10(b)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least two identical hydraulic-power actuating systems,  which, acting simultaneously in normal operation, must comply with Sec.  58.25-10(b)(2). (When they must so comply, these systems must be  connected. Loss of hydraulic fluid from one system must be capable of  being detected, and the defective system automatically isolated, so the  other system or systems remain fully operational.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Steering gear other than hydraulic must meet equivalent  standards to the satisfaction of the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety  Center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On each tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or over, but less than  100,000 deadweight tons, the main steering gear need not comply with  paragraph (c) of this section if the rudder actuator or actuators  installed are non-duplicated hydraulic and if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actuators comply with Sec. 58.25-60; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In case of loss of steering capability due to a single failure  either of any part of the piping systems or in one of the power units,  steering capability can be regained in not more than 45 seconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On each tank vessel of less than 70,000 deadweight tons,  constructed before, and with a steering-gear installation before,  September 1, 1986, and on an international voyage, the steering gear not  complying with paragraph (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, as  applicable, may continue in service if the steering gear has a proved  record of reliability and is in good repair.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or over, constructed  before, and with a steering-gear installation before, September 1, 1984,  must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the applicable requirements in Sec. Sec. 58.25-15, 58.25- 20(c), 58.25-25 (a), (d), and (e), and 58.25-70 (e), (h), (i), and (j);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure working access to machinery and controls in the steering- gear compartment (which must include handrails and either gratings or  other non-slip surfaces to ensure a safe working environment in case  hydraulic fluid leaks);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have two separate and independent steering-gear control systems,   each of which can be operated from the pilothouse; except that it need  not have separate steering wheels or steering levers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Arrange each system required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section  so that, if the one in operation fails, the other can be operated from  the pilothouse immediately; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Supply each system required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section,  if electric, with power by a circuit that is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Used for no other purpose; and either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Connected in the steering-gear compartment to the circuit  supplying power to the power unit or units operated by that system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Connected directly to the busbars supplying the circuit for  its steering-gear power unit or units at a point on the switchboard  adjacent to that supply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each tank vessel of 40,000 gross tons or over, constructed  before, and with a steering-gear installation before, September 1, 1984,  and on an international voyage, must have the steering gear arranged so  that, in case of a single failure of the piping or of one of the power  units, either steering capability equivalent to that required of the  auxiliary steering gear by Sec. 58.25-10(c)(2) can be maintained or the  rudder's movement can be limited so that steering capability can be  speedily regained in less than 10 minutes. This arrangement must be  achieved by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An independent means of restraining the rudder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fast-acting valves that may be manually operated to isolate the  actuator or actuators from the external hydraulic piping, together with  a means of directly refilling the actuators by a fixed, independent,  power-operated pump and piping; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An arrangement such that, if hydraulic-power actuating systems  are connected, loss of hydraulic fluid from one system must be detected  and the defective system isolated either automatically or from within  the pilothouse so that the other system remains fully operational.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The term ``piping or * * * one of the power units'' in  paragraph (g) of this section refers to the pressure-containing  components in hydraulic or electro-hydraulic steering gear. It does not  include rudder actuators or hydraulic-control servo piping and pumps  used to stroke the pump or valves of the power unit, unless their  failure would result in failure of the unit or of the piping to the  actuator.</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 58.30_Fluid Power and Control Systems</p>
