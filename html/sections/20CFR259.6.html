A final determination may be  reopened at the request of a party who was, or could have been, a party  to the final determination when the party alleges that the law or the  facts upon which the final determination was based have changed  sufficiently to warrant a contrary determination. Such a request shall  be submitted to the Secretary to the Board, who shall consider such  request as a request for an initial determination under Sec. 259.1.  [57 FR 4366, Feb. 5, 1992]</p>
