                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the information required by Sec. 25.114, applicants for geostationary-orbit FSS space stations must provide an interference analysis to demonstrate the compatibility of their proposed system with respect to authorized space stations within 2 degrees of any proposed satellite point of communication. An applicant should provide details of its proposed radio frequency carriers which it believes should be taken into account in this analysis. At a minimum, the applicant must include, for each type of radio frequency carrier, the link noise budget, modulation parameters, and overall link performance analysis. (See Appendices B and C to Licensing of Space Stations in the Domestic Fixed-Satellite Service, FCC 83-184, and the following public notices, copies of which are available in the Commission's EDOCS database: DA 03-3863 and DA 04-1708.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each applicant for a license for a 17/24 GHz Broadcasting-Satellite Service space station must provide the following information, in addition to that required by Sec. 25.114:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)-(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, an applicant for a license to operate a 17/24 GHz BSS space station that will be located precisely at one of the 17/24 GHz BSS orbital locations specified in Appendix F of the Report and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76, must provide an interference analysis of the kind described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the applicant must demonstrate the compatibility of its proposed network with any current or future authorized space station in the 17/24 GHz BSS that complies with the technical rules in this part and that will be located at least four degrees from the proposed space station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, an applicant for a license to operate a 17/24 GHz BSS space station that will not be located precisely at one of the nominal 17/24 GHz BSS orbital locations specified in Appendix F of the Report and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76, must make one of the following showings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In cases where there is no previously licensed or proposed space station to be located closer than four degrees from the applicant's space station, and the applicant seeks to operate pursuant to Sec. 25.262(b) of this part, the applicant must provide an interference analysis of the kind described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the applicant must demonstrate the compatibility of its proposed network with any current or future authorized space stations in the 17/24 GHz BSS that are operating in compliance with the technical rules of this part and that will be located at least four degrees from the applicant's proposed space station;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where there is a previously licensed or proposed 17/24 GHz BSS space station to be located within four degrees of the applicant's proposed space station, the applicant must provide an interference analysis of the kind described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the applicant must demonstrate that its proposed network will not cause more interference to the adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS satellite networks operating in compliance with the technical requirements of this part, than if the applicant were located at the precise Appendix F orbital location from which it seeks to offset;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In cases where there is no previously licensed or proposed 17/24 GHz

In addition, any 17/24 GHz BSS satellite applicant that has reached a coordination agreement with an operator of another 17/24 GHz BSS satellite to allow that operator to exceed the pfd levels specified in the rules for this service, must use those higher pfd levels for the purposes of this showing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operators of satellite networks using 17/24 GHz BSS space stations must design their satellite networks to be capable of operating with another 17/24 GHz BSS space station as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section, all satellite network operators using 17/24 GHz BSS space stations must design their satellite networks to be capable of operating with another 17/24 GHz BSS space station as close as four degrees away.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Satellite network operators located less than four degrees away from a space station to be operated pursuant to Sec. 25.262(b) of this part must design their satellite networks to be capable of operating with that adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS space station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Satellite network operators using 17/24 GHz BSS space stations located at an orbital location other than those specified in Appendix F of the Report and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76, and that are not operating pursuant to Sec. 25.262(b) of this part, must design their satellite networks to be capable of operating with another 17/24 GHz BSS space station closer than four degrees away, as a result of the operator's offset position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)-(g)</em> [Reserved]
