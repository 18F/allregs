The Mentor-Protege Program is also designed to improve the performance of VA contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to Protege entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between SDVOSBs, VOSBs and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of SDVOSBs and VOSBs that receive VA contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a Protege under a VA contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.</p>
