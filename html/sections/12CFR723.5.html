                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. The board of directors must adopt specific business  loan policies and review them at least annually. The board must also use  the services of an individual with at least two years direct experience  with the type of lending the credit union will be engaging in. The  experience must provide the credit union sufficient expertise given the  complexity and risk exposure of the loans in which the credit union  intends to engage. Credit unions do not have to hire staff to meet the  requirements of this section but must ensure that the expertise is  available. A credit union can meet the experience requirement through  various approaches. For example, a credit union can use the services of  a credit union service organization (CUSO), an employee of another  credit union, an independent contractor, or other third parties.  However, the actual decision to grant a loan must reside with the credit  union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conflicts of Interest. Any third party used by a credit union to  meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be  independent from the transaction and is prohibited from having a  participation in the loan or an interest in the collateral securing the  loan that the third party is responsible for reviewing, with the  following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The third party may provide a service to the credit union  related to the transaction, such as loan servicing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The third party may provide the requisite experience to the  credit union and purchase a loan or a participation interest in a loan  originated by the credit union that the third party reviewed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A credit union may use the services of a CUSO that otherwise  meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section even though the  CUSO is not independent from the transaction, provided the credit union  has a controlling financial interest in the CUSO as determined under  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
