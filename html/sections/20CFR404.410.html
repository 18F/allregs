                                Sec. 404.410  How does SSA reduce my benefits when my entitlement
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Generally your old-age, wife's, husband's, widow's, or widower's  benefits are reduced if entitlement begins before the month you attain  full retirement age (as defined in Sec. 404.409). However, your benefits  as a wife or husband are not reduced for any month in which you have in  your care a child of the worker on whose earnings record you are  entitled. The child must be entitled to child's benefits. Your benefits  as a widow or widower are not reduced below the benefit amount you would  receive as a mother or father for any month in which you have in your  care a child of the worker on whose record you are entitled. The child  must be entitled to child's benefits. Subject to Secs. 404.411 through  404.413, reductions in benefits are made in the amounts described.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How does SSA reduce my old-age benefits? The reduction in your  primary insurance amount is based on the number of months of entitlement  prior to the month you attain full retirement age. The reduction is \5/ 9\ of 1 percent for each of the first 36 months and \5/12\ of 1 percent  for each month in excess of 36.</p><p class="depth2">Example: Alex's full retirement age for unreduced benefits is 65  years and 8 months. She elects to begin receiving benefits at age 62.  Her primary insurance amount of $980.50 must be reduced because of her  entitlement to benefits 44 months prior to full retirement age. The  reduction is 36 months at \5/9\ of 1 percent and 8 months at \5/12\ of 1  percent.   980.50 x 36 x \5/9\ x .01 = $196.10 980.50 x 8 x \5/12\ x .01 = $ 32.68     The two added together equal a total reduction of $228.78. This amount  is rounded to $228.80 (the next higher multiple of 10 cents) and  deducted from the primary insurance amount. The resulting $751.70 is the  monthly benefit payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How does SSA reduce my wife's or husband's benefits? Your wife's  or husband's benefits before any reduction (see Secs. 404.304 and  404.333) are reduced first (if necessary) for the family maximum under  Sec. 404.403. They are then reduced based on the number of months of  entitlement prior to the month you attain full retirement age. This does  not include any month in which you have a child of the worker on whose  earnings record you are entitled in your care. The child must be  entitled to child benefits. The reduction is \25/36\ of 1 percent for  each of the first 36 months and \5/12\ of 1 percent for each month in  excess of 36.</p><p class="depth2">Example: Sam is entitled to old-age benefits. His spouse Ashley  elects to begin receiving wife's benefits at age 63. Her full retirement  age for unreduced benefits is 65 and 4 months. Her benefit will be  reduced for 28 months of entitlement prior to full retirement age. If  her unreduced benefit is $412.40 the reduction will be $412.40 x 28 x  \25/36\ x .01. The resulting $80.18 is rounded to $80.20 (the next  higher multiple of 10 cents) and subtracted from $412.40 to determine  the monthly benefit amount of $332.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How does SSA reduce my widow's or widower's benefits? Your  entitlement to widow's or widower's benefits may begin at age 60 based  on age or at age 50 based on disability. Refer to Sec. 404.335 for more  information on the requirements for entitlement. Both types are reduced  if entitlement begins prior to attainment of full retirement age (as  defined in Sec. 404.409).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Widow's or widower's benefits based on age. Your widow's or  widower's unreduced benefit amount (the worker's primary insurance  amount after any reduction for the family maximum under Sec. 404.403),  is reduced or further reduced based on the number of months of  entitlement prior to the month you attain full retirement age. This does  not include any month in which you have in your care a child of the  worker on whose earnings record you are entitled. The child must be  entitled to child's benefits. The number of months of entitlement prior  to full retirement age is multiplied by .285 and then divided by the  number of months in the period beginning with the month of attainment of  age 60 and ending with the month immediately before the month of  attainment of full retirement age.</p><p class="depth3">Example: Ms. Bogle is entitled to an unreduced widow benefit of  $785.70 beginning at age 64. Her full retirement age for unreduced old- age benefits is 65 years and 4 months. She will receive benefits for 16  months prior to attainment of full retirement age. The number of months  in the period from age 60 through full retirement age of 65 and 4 months  is 64. The reduction in her benefit is $785.70 x 16 x .285 divided by 64  or $55.98. $55.98 is rounded to the next higher multiple of 10 cents  ($56.00) and subtracted from $785.70. The result is a monthly benefit of  $729.70.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Widow's or widower's benefits based on disability. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For  months after December 1983, your widow's or widower's benefits are not  reduced for months of entitlement prior to age 60. You are deemed to be  age 60 in your month of entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's  benefits and your benefits are reduced only under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For months from January 1973 through December 1983, benefits as  a disabled widow or widower were reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section. The benefits were then subject to an additional reduction of  \43/240\ of one percent for each month of entitlement prior to age 60  based on disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Widow's or widower's benefits prior to 1973. For months prior to  January 1973 benefits as a widow or widower were reduced only for months  of entitlement prior to age 62. The reduction was \5/9\ of one percent  for each month of entitlement from the month of attainment of age 60  through the month prior to the month of attainment of age 62. There was  an additional reduction of \43/198\ of one percent for each month of  entitlement prior to age 60 based on disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If my benefits are reduced under this section does SSA ever  change the reduction? The reduction computed under paragraphs (a), (b)  or (c) of this section may later be adjusted to eliminate reduction for  certain months of entitlement prior to full retirement age as provided  in Sec. 404.412. For special provisions on reducing benefits for months   prior to full retirement age involving entitlement to two or more  benefits, see Sec. 404.411.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Are my widow's or widower's benefits affected if the deceased  worker was entitled to old-age benefits? If the deceased individual was  entitled to old-age benefits, see Sec. 404.338 for special rules that  may affect your reduced widow's or widower's benefits.  [68 FR 4708, Jan. 30, 2003]</p>
