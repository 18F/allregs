The  contracting officer may authorize the recipients to use the forms or  formats described in 10 CFR 600.312(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the payments are based on payable milestones, the recipient  will submit a report or other evidence of accomplishment to the program  official at the completion of each predetermined activity. If the award  is an expenditure-based TIA that includes minimum cost sharing  percentages for milestones (see 10 CFR 603.570(c)), the recipient must  certify in the report that the minimum cost sharing requirement has been  met. The contracting officer may approve payment to the recipient after  receiving validation from the program manager that the milestone was  successfully reached.</p>
