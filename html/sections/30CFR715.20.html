                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The permittee shall establish on all land that has  been disturbed, a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetative cover of  species native to the area of disturbed land or species that will  support the planned postmining uses of the land approved according to  Sec. 715.13. For areas designated as prime farmland, the reclamation  procedures of Sec. 716.7 shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revegetation shall be carried out in a manner that encourages a  prompt vegetative cover and recovery of productivity levels compatible  with approved land uses. The vegetative cover shall be capable of  stabilizing the soil surface with respect to erosion. All disturbed  lands, except water areas and surface areas of roads that are approved  as a part of the postmining land use, shall be seeded or planted to  achieve a vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the  area of disturbed land. If both the pre- and postmining land use is  intensive agriculture, planting of the crops normally grown will meet  the requirement. Vegetative cover will be considered of the same  seasonal variety when it consists of a mixture of species of equal or  superior utility for the intended land use when compared with the  utility of naturally occurring vegetation during each season of the  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On Federal lands, the surface management agency shall be  consulted for approval prior to revegetation regarding what species are  selected, and following revegetation, to determine when the area is  ready to be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of introduced species. Introduced species may be substituted  for native species only if appropriate field trials have demonstrated  that the introduced species are of equal or superior utility for the  approved postmining land use, or are necessary to achieve a quick,  temporary, and stabilizing cover. Such species substitution shall be  approved by the regulatory authority. Introduced species shall meet  applicable State and Federal seed or introduced species statutes, and  shall not include poisonous or potentially toxic species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of revegetation. Seeding and planting of disturbed areas  shall be   conducted during the first normal period for favorable planting  conditions after final preparation. The normal period for favorable  planting shall be that planting time generally accepted locally for the  type of plant materials selected to meet specific site conditions and  climate. Any disturbed areas, except water areas and surface areas or  roads that are approved under Sec. 715.13 as part of the postmining  land use, which have been graded shall be seeded with a temporary cover  of small grains, grasses, or legumes to control erosion until an  adequate permanent cover is established. When rills or gullies, that  would preclude the successful establishment of vegetation or the  achievement of the postmining land use, form in regraded topsoil and  overburden materials as specified in Sec. 715.14, additional regrading  or other stabilization practices will be required before seeding and  planting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mulching. Mulch shall be used on all regraded and topsoiled  areas to control erosion, to promote germination of seeds, and to  increase the moisture retention of the soil. Mulch shall be anchored to  the soil surface where appropriate, to insure effective protection of  the soil and vegetation. Mulch means vegetation residues or other  suitable materials that aid in soil stabilization and soil moisture  conservation, thus providing micro-climatic conditions suitable for  germination and growth, and do not interfere with the postmining use of  the land. Annual grains such as oats, rye and wheat may be used instead  of mulch when it is shown to the satisfaction of the regulatory  authority that the substituted grains will provide adequate stability  and that they will later be replaced by species approved for the  postmining use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Methods of revegetation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The permittee shall use technical  publications or the results of laboratory and field tests approved by  the regulatory authority to determine the varieties, species, seeding  rates, and soil amendment practices essential for establishment and  self-regeneration of vegetation. The regulatory authority shall approve  species selection and planting plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where hayland, pasture, or range is to be the postmining land  use, the species of grasses, legumes, browse, trees, or forbes for  seeding or planting and their pattern of distribution shall be selected  by the permittee to provide a diverse, effective, and permanent  vegetative cover with the seasonal variety, succession, distribution,  and regenerative capabilities native to the area. Livestock grazing will  not be allowed on reclaimed land until the seedlings are established and  can sustain managed grazing. The regulatory authority, in consultation  with the permittee and the landowner or in concurrence with the  governmental landmanaging agency having jurisdiction over the surface,  shall determine when the revegetated area is ready for livestock  grazing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where forest is to be the postmining land use, the permittee  shall plant trees adapted for local site conditions and climate. Trees  shall be planted in combination with an herbaceous cover of grains,  grasses, legumes, forbs, or woody plants to provide a diverse,  effective, and permanent vegetation cover with the seasonal variety,  sucession, and regeneration capabilities native to the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where wildlife habitat is to be included in the postmining land  use, the permittee shall consult with appropriate State and Federal  wildlife and land management agencies and shall select those species  that will fulfill the needs of wildlife, including food, water, cover,  and space. Plant groupings and water resources shall be spaced and  distributed to fulfill the requirements of wildlife.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Standards for measuring success of revegetation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Success of  revegetation shall be measured on the basis of reference areas approved  by the regulatory authority. Reference areas mean land units of varying  size and shape identified and maintained under appropriate management  for the purpose of measuring ground cover, productivity and species  diversity that are produced naturally. The reference areas must be  representative of geology, soils, slope, aspect, and vegetation in the  permit area. Management of the reference area shall be comparable to  that which will be required for the approved   postmining land use of the area to be mined. The regulatory authority  shall approve the estimating techniques that will be used to determine  the degree of success in the revegetated area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ground cover of living plants on the revegetated area shall  be equal to the ground cover of living plants of the approved reference  area for a minimum of two growing seasons. The ground cover shall not be  considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the ground cover of  the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area.  Exceptions may be authorized by the regulatory authority for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Previously mined areas that were not reclaimed to the standards  required by this chapter prior to the effective date of these  regulations. The ground cover of living plants for such areas shall not  be less than required to control erosion, and in no case less than that  existing before redisturbance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Areas to be developed immediately for industrial or residential  use. The ground cover of living plants shall not be less than required  to control erosion. As used in this paragraph, immediately means less  than 2 years after regrading has been completed for the area to be used;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Areas to be used for agricultural cropland purposes. Success  in revegetation of cropland shall be determined on the basis of crop  production from the mined area compared to the reference area. Crop  production from the mined area shall be equal to that of the approved  reference area for a minimum of two growing seasons. Production shall  not be considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the production  of the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Species diversity, distribution, seasonal variety, and vigor  shall be evaluated on the basis of the results which could reasonably be  expected using the methods of revegetation approved under paragraph (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Seeding of stockpiled topsoil. Topsoil stockpiled in compliance  with Sec. 715.16 must be seeded or planted with an effective cover of  nonnoxious, quick growing annual and perennial plants during the first  normal period for favorable planting conditions or protected by other  approved measures as specified in Sec. 715.16.</p>
