                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition of error--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Types of transfers or inquiries  covered. For purposes of this section, the term error means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a  remittance transfer unless the disclosure stated an estimate of the  amount paid by a sender in accordance with Sec. 1005.32(b)(2) and the  difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees,  and taxes, rather than any estimated amount;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A computational or bookkeeping error made by the remittance  transfer provider relating to a remittance transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The failure to make available to a designated recipient the  amount of currency disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and  stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under Sec. 1005.31(b)(2)  or (3) for the remittance transfer, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The disclosure stated an estimate of the amount to be received  in accordance with Sec. 1005.32(a), (b)(1) or (b)(2) and the difference  results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes,  rather than any estimated amounts; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside  the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been  reasonably anticipated; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The difference results from the application of non-covered  third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a  person other than the provider and the provider provided the disclosure  required by Sec. 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The failure to make funds available to a designated recipient  by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided to the  sender under Sec. 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer,  unless the failure to make the funds available resulted from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer  provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Delays related to a necessary investigation or other special  action by the remittance transfer provider or a third party as required  by the provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the  Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311 et seq., Office of Foreign Assets  Control requirements, or similar laws or requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The remittance transfer being made with fraudulent intent by the  sender or any person acting in concert with the sender; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The sender having provided the remittance transfer provider an  incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier for the  designated recipient's account or institution, provided that the  remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in paragraph  (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The sender's request for documentation required by Sec. 1005.31  or for additional information or clarification concerning a remittance  transfer, including a request a sender makes to determine whether an  error exists under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Types of transfers or inquiries not covered. The term error does  not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer, except  where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a  designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability as described  in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping  purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change requested by the designated recipient; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A change in the amount or type of currency received by the  designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the  disclosure provided to the sender under Sec. 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the  remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the  sender as permitted under Sec. 1005.31 in making such disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice of error from sender--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timing; contents. A remittance  transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of this section  with respect to any oral or written notice of error from a sender that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is received by the remittance transfer provider no later than  180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance  transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Enables the provider to identify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The sender's name and telephone number or address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or  address of the recipient; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indicates why the sender believes an error exists and includes  to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except  for requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification  described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Request for documentation or clarification. When a notice of  error is based on documentation, additional information, or  clarification that the sender previously requested under paragraph  (a)(1)(v) of this section, the sender's notice of error is timely if  received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after  the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days  after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification  that had been requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time limits and extent of investigation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time limits for  investigation and report to consumer of error. A remittance transfer  provider shall investigate promptly and determine whether an error  occurred within 90 days of receiving a notice of error. The remittance  transfer provider shall report the results to the sender, including  notice of any remedies available for correcting any error that the  provider determines has occurred, within three business days after  completing its investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this  section, if, following an assertion of an error by a sender, the  remittance transfer provider determines an error occurred, the provider  shall, within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable  after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate  remedy, correct the error as designated by the sender by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through  (iii) of this section, as applicable, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Refunding to the sender the amount of funds provided by the  sender in connection with a remittance transfer which was not properly  transmitted, or the amount appropriate to resolve the error; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Making available to the designated recipient, without additional  cost to the sender or to the designated recipient, the amount  appropriate to resolve the error;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, in  the case of an error under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> As applicable, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Refunding to the sender the amount of funds provided by the  sender in connection with a remittance transfer which was not properly  transmitted, or the amount appropriate to resolve the error; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Making available to the designated recipient the amount  appropriate to resolve the error. Such amount must be made available to  the designated recipient without additional cost to the sender or to the  designated recipient; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Refunding to the sender any fees imposed and, to the extent not  prohibited by law, taxes collected on the remittance transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an error under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this  section that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or  insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer, the  remittance transfer provider shall provide the remedies required by  paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section within  three   business days of providing the report required by paragraph (c)(1) or  (d)(1) of this section except that the provider may agree to the  sender's request, upon receiving the results of the error investigation,  that the funds be applied towards a new remittance transfer, rather than  be refunded, if the provider has not yet processed a refund. The  provider may deduct from the amount refunded or applied towards a new  transfer any fees actually imposed on or, to the extent not prohibited  by law, taxes actually collected on the remittance transfer as part of  the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt except that the  provider shall not deduct its own fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a request under paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this  section, providing the requested documentation, information, or  clarification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> if  it determines that no error occurred or that an error occurred in a  manner or amount different from that described by the sender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Explanation of results of investigation. The remittance transfer  provider's report of the results of the investigation shall include a  written explanation of the provider's findings and shall note the  sender's right to request the documents on which the provider relied in  making its determination. The explanation shall also address the  specific complaint of the sender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Copies of documentation. Upon the sender's request, the  remittance transfer provider shall promptly provide copies of the  documents on which the provider relied in making its error  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reassertion of error. A remittance transfer provider that has  fully complied with the error resolution requirements of this section  has no further responsibilities under this section should the sender  later reassert the same error, except in the case of an error asserted  by the sender following receipt of information provided under paragraph  (a)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Relation to other laws--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Relation to Regulation E  Sec. 1005.11 for incorrect EFTs from a sender's account. If an alleged  error involves an incorrect electronic fund transfer from a sender's  account in connection with a remittance transfer, and the sender  provides a notice of error to the account-holding institution, the  account-holding institution shall comply with the requirements of  Sec. 1005.11 governing error resolution rather than the requirements of  this section, provided that the account-holding institution is not also  the remittance transfer provider. If the remittance transfer provider is  also the financial institution that holds the consumer's account, then  the error-resolution provisions of this section apply when the sender  provides such notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relation to Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. If an alleged  error involves an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a  remittance transfer, an incorrect amount received by the designated  recipient under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section that is an  extension of credit for property or services not delivered as agreed, or  the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of  availability under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section that is an  extension of credit for property or services not delivered as agreed,  and the sender provides a notice of error to the creditor extending the  credit, the provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, governing error  resolution apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements of this  section, even if the creditor is the remittance transfer provider.  However, if the creditor is the remittance transfer provider, paragraph  (b) of this section will apply instead of 12 CFR 1026.13(b). If the  sender instead provides a notice of error to the remittance transfer  provider that is not also the creditor, then the error-resolution  provisions of this section apply to the remittance transfer provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unauthorized remittance transfers. If an alleged error involves  an unauthorized electronic fund transfer for payment in connection with  a remittance transfer, Sec. Sec. 1005.6 and 1005.11   apply with respect to the account-holding institution. If an alleged  error involves an unauthorized use of a credit account for payment in  connection with a remittance transfer, the provisions of Regulation Z,  12 CFR 1026.12(b), if applicable, and Sec. 1026.13, apply with respect  to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Compliance program. A remittance transfer provider shall develop and  maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure  compliance with the error resolution requirements applicable to  remittance transfers under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retention of error-related documentation. The remittance  transfer provider's policies and procedures required under paragraph  (g)(1) of this section shall include policies and procedures regarding  the retention of documentation related to error investigations. Such  policies and procedures must ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any  notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the  sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the  findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation  of the alleged error. Remittance transfer providers are subject to the  record retention requirements under Sec. 1005.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier  provided by the sender. The exception in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(D) of this  section applies if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The remittance transfer provider can demonstrate that the sender  provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier  to the provider in connection with the remittance transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect  recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer,  the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the  recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to  the recipient institution name provided by the sender;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The provider provided notice to the sender before the sender  made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender  provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution  identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount. For purposes of  providing this disclosure, Sec. 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice  unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures  required by this subpart for which information is permitted to be  disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which  case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as those other  disclosures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier  resulted in the deposit of the remittance transfer into a customer's  account that is not the designated recipient's account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The provider promptly used reasonable efforts to recover the  amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.
