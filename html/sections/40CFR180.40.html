                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Group or subgroup tolerances may be established as a result of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A petition from a person who has submitted an application for the registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the initiative of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A petition by an interested person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tables in Sec. 180.41 are to be used in conjunction with this section for the establishment of crop group tolerances. Each table in Sec. 180.41 lists a group of raw agricultural commodities that are considered to be related for the purposes of this section. Refer also to Sec. 180.1(g) for a listing of commodities for which established tolerances may be applied to certain other related and similar commodities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When there is an established or proposed tolerance for all of the representative commodities for a specific group or subgroup of related commodities, a tolerance may be established for all commodities in the associated group or subgroup. Tolerances may be established for a crop group or, alternatively, tolerances may be established for one or more of the subgroups of a crop group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The representative crops are given as an indication of the minimum residue chemistry data base acceptable to the Agency for the purposes of establishing a group tolerance. The Agency may, at its discretion, allow group tolerances when data on suitable substitutes for the representative crops are available (e.g., limes instead of lemons).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Since a group tolerance reflects maximum residues likely to occur on all individual crops within a group, the proposed or registered patterns of use for all crops in the group or subgroup must be similar before a group tolerance is established. The pattern of use consists of the amount of pesticide applied, the number of times applied, the timing of the first application, the interval between applications, and the interval between the last application and harvest. The pattern of use will also include the type of application; for example, soil or foliar application, or application by ground or aerial equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the crop grouping contains commodities or byproducts that are utilized for animal feed, any needed tolerance or exemption from a tolerance for the pesticide in meat, milk, poultry and/or eggs must be established before a tolerance will be granted for the group as a whole. The representative crops include all crops in the group that could be processed such that residues may concentrate in processed food and/or feed. Processing data will be required prior to establishment of a group tolerance. Tolerances will not be granted on a group basis as to processed foods prepared from crops covered by the group tolerance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If maximum residues (tolerances) for the representative crops vary by more than a factor of 5 from the maximum value observed for any crop in the group, a group or subgroup tolerance will ordinarily not be established. In this case individual crop tolerances, rather than group tolerances, will normally be established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Alternatively, a commodity with a residue level significantly higher or lower than the other commodities in a group may be excluded from the group tolerance (e.g., cereal grains, except corn). In this case an individual tolerance at the appropriate level for the unique commodity would be established, if necessary. The alternative approach of excluding a commodity with a significantly higher or lower residue level will not be used to establish a tolerance for a commodity subgroup. Most subgroups have only two representative commodities; to exclude one such commodity and its related residue data would likely provide insufficient residue information to support the remainder of the subgroup. Residue data

from crops additional to those representative crops in a grouping may be required for systemic pesticides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The commodities included in the groups will be updated periodically either at the initiative of the Agency or at the request of an interested party. Persons interested in updating this section should contact the Registration Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> When EPA amends a crop group in a manner that expands or contracts the commodities that are covered by the group, EPA will initially retain the pre-existing as well as the revised crop group in the CFR. The revised crop group will have the same number as the pre-existing crop group; however, the revised crop group number will be followed by a hyphen and the final two digits of the year in which it was established (e.g., if Crop Group 1 is amended in 2007, the revised group will be designated as Crop Group 1-07). If the pre-existing crop group had crop subgroups, these subgroups will be numbered in a similar fashion in the revised crop group. The name of the revised crop group will not be changed from the pre-existing crop group unless the revision so changes the composition of the crop group that the pre-existing name is no longer accurate. Once a revised crop group is established, EPA will no longer establish tolerances under the pre-existing crop group. At appropriate times, EPA will amend tolerances for crop groups that have been superseded by revised crop groups to conform the pre-existing crop group to the revised crop group. Once all of the tolerances for the pre-existing crop group have been updated, the pre-existing crop group will be removed from the CFR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Establishment of a tolerance does not substitute for the additional need to register the pesticide under a companion law, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The Registration Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs should be contacted concerning procedures for registration of new uses of a pesticide.
