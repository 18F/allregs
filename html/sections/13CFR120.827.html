                            <p class="depth0">A CDC may provide a small business with assistance unrelated to the 504 loan program as long as the CDC does not make such assistance a condition of the CDC accepting from that small business an application for a 504 loan. An example of other services a CDC may provide is assisting a small business in applying for a 7(a) loan (as described in Sec. 120.2). A CDC is subject to part 103 of this chapter when providing such assistance.
