                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Resource use objectives through development and management programs will be incorporated into Phase I, and Phase II General Design Memoranda and Master Plans for authorized and completed water resource projects (report requirements depend on AE&D; status of project). The establishment of resource use objectives for projects formulated under the part 290 of this chapter planning process should not require a great deal of additional effort to bring them in compliance with this regulation. However, more effort may be required for completed projects with existing use patterns and constructed facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regional studies are prerequisite to effective project planning for establishment of resource use objectives. Division engineers are responsible for issuing criteria and instructions, for use by district engineers, on establishing regional boundaries, conduct of regional studies and content and format of report requirements. As a minimum, one criteria to consider is that a regional boundary could be formed by double the estimated distance from the centroids of population located within the market area of any operating project. Regional boundaries need not be restricted either to States or to District hydrologic boundaries. In those cases where a region may cross District boundaries, division engineers will establish administrative responsibility. District engineers are responsible for preparation of districtwide regional boundary plans, scheduling of study efforts, and report preparation. Boundary plans, study schedules and reports shall be submitted for approval in accordance with instructions issued by the division engineer. Four copies of the approved regional boundary plan and regional study report will be furnished to HQDA (DAEN-CWP-P), WASH DC 20314 for comment, in accordance with procedures given in ER 1110-2-1150. Investigations and report preparation for regional studies may be accomplished with funds from Operation and Maintenance General appropriations programmed for preparation of individual project Master Plans. Through implementation of the regional analysis approach, it is expected that an overall savings in individual Master Plan preparation can be realized. In any event, it is not expected that the overall program cost will increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> District engineers will incorporate the establishment of resource use objectives into the on-going Master Plan preparation process. Those Master Plans currently being prepared or updated and not substantially completed should be modified to reflect this policy. Those projects with high quality resources and/or conflicts between use and current resource management should be given a high priority so that redirection of facility development and management programs can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
