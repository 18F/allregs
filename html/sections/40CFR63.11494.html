To determine the Table 1 HAP content of feedstocks, you may rely on  formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the  Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for the material. If the concentration  in an MSDS is presented as a range, use the upper bound of the range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quinoline is generated as byproduct and is present in the CMPU  in any liquid stream (process or waste) at a concentration greater than  1.0 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Hydrazine and/or Table 1 organic HAP other than quinoline are  generated as byproduct and are present in the CMPU in any liquid stream  (process or waste), continuous process vent, or batch process vent at an  individual concentration greater than 0.1 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Hydrazine or any Table 1 HAP is produced as a product of the  CMPU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A CMPU includes all process vessels, equipment, and activities  necessary to operate a chemical manufacturing process that produces a  material or a family of materials described by North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code 325. A CMPU consists of one or more  unit operations and any associated recovery devices. A CMPU also  includes each storage tank, transfer operation, surge control vessel,  and bottoms receiver associated with the production of such NAICS code  325 materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Affected sources under the following chemical manufacturing area  source categories listed pursuant to Clean Air Act (CAA) section  112(c)(3) and 112(k)(3)(B)(ii) that are subject to area source standards  under this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacture of Paint and Allied Products, subject to subpart  CCCCCCC of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mercury Emissions from Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plants,  subject to subpart IIIII of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Polyvinyl Chloride and Copolymers Production, subject to  subpart DDDDDD of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Acrylic and Modacrylic Fibers Production, subject to subpart  LLLLLL of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Carbon Black Production, subject to subpart MMMMMM of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Chemical Manufacturing Area Sources: Chromium Compounds,  subject to subpart NNNNNN of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Lead oxide production at Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing  Facilities, subject to subpart PPPPPP of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production of the following chemical manufacturing materials  described in NAICS code 325:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacture of radioactive elements or isotopes, radium  chloride, radium luminous compounds, strontium, uranium.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacture of photographic film, paper, and plate where the  material is coated with or contains chemicals.

A CMPU using only Table 1 metal HAP is  required to control only total CAA section 112(b) metal HAP in  accordance with Sec. 63.11495 and, if applicable, Sec. 63.11496(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An affected source is an existing source if you commenced  construction or reconstruction of the affected source before October 6,  2008.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An affected source is a new source if you commenced construction  or reconstruction of the affected source on or after October 6, 2008.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any area source that installed a federally-enforceable control  device on an affected CMPU is required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR  part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 if the control device on the affected CMPU is  necessary to maintain the source's emissions at area source levels. For  new and existing sources subject to this rule on December 21, 2012 and  subject to title V as a result of this rule, a complete title V permit  application must be submitted no later than December 21, 2013.
