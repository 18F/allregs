                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or  instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by  ownership, rent, or lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part,  any building unless it is determined that such building includes a  satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending  facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a purchase contract, an  agreement to lease, or other similar commitment was entered into prior  to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or  instrumentality of the United States, shall undertake to occupy, in  whole or in part, any building which is to be constructed, substantially  altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building which is occupied on  January 2, 1975 by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the  United States, no such department, agency, or instrumentality shall  undertake to substantially alter or renovate such building, unless it is  determined that the design for such construction,   substantial alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or  sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind  vendor. In those cases where a design contract or other similar  commitment was entered into prior to January 2, 1975, the provisions of  this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph,  substantial alteration or renovation of a building means a permanent  material change in the floor area of such building which would render  such building appropriate for the location and operation of a vending  facility by a blind vendor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The determination that a building contains a satisfactory site  or sites under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made after  consultation between the State licensing agency and the head of the  department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which is  planning to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. In order to make  such determination, effective on the publication date of this part each  such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide to the  appropriate State licensing agency written notice of its intention to  acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Such written notice shall be  by certified or registered mail with return receipt and shall be  provided as early as practicable but no later than 60 days prior to such  intended action. The written notice shall indicate that a satisfactory  site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by  blind persons is included in the plans for the building to be acquired  or otherwise occupied and shall further assure that the State licensing  agency shall be afforded the opportunity to determine whether such  building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility.  The written notice shall further assure that the State licensing agency,  subject to the approval of the head of the Federal property managing  department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be offered the opportunity  to select the location and type of vending facility to be operated by a  blind vendor prior to the completion of the final space layout of the  building. The receipt of such written notice shall be acknowledged in  writing promptly by the State licensing agency but no later than within  30 days and the State licensing agency shall indicate at that time  whether it is interested in establishing a vending facility. A copy of  the written notice to the State licensing agency and the State licensing  agency's acknowledgement shall be provided to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When, after a written notice has been provided under paragraph  (c) of this section, the State licensing agency determines that the  number of persons using the Federal property is or will be insufficient  to support a vending facility, and the Secretary concurs with such  determination, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section  shall not apply. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section shall also not apply when fewer than 100 Federal Government  employees are or will be located during normal working hours in the  building to be acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building  contains less than 15,000 square feet of interior space to be utilized  for Federal Government purposes in the case of buildings in which  services are to be provided to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The operation of a vending facility established under pre- existing arrangements shall not be affected by the provisions of this  section. The provisions of this section shall further not preclude  future arrangements under which vending facilities to be operated by  blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an  employee population less than that specified in paragraph (d) of this  section: Provided, That both the State licensing agency and the Federal  property managing department, agency or instrumentality concur in such  establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United  States, when leasing property in privately owned buildings, shall make  every effort to lease property capable of accommodating a vending  facility. When, however, such department, agency, or instrumentality is  leasing part of a privately owned building in which prior to the  execution of the lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in  operation or had entered into a contract for the operation of a  restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included  in such lease and the operation   of a vending facility by a blind vendor would be in proximate and  substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food  facility, the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section  shall not apply.</p>
