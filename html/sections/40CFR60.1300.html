                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Follow table 5 of this subpart to establish the sampling  location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse  points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements  for the different pollutants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at  least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8. Use the average of  the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to  determine compliance with the emission limits in table 1 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same  time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as  specified in Sec. 60.1230.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use the equations in Sec. 60.1460(a) to calculate emission  levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the  percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the  reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test  methods in table 5 of this subpart for other required equations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You can apply to the Administrator for approval under Sec.  60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in methodology, use  an equivalent method, use an alternative method the results of which the  Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance,  waive the requirement for a performance test because you have  demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, or use a shorter  sampling time or smaller sampling volume.</p>
