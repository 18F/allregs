A supplement documenting this action was approved by the Assistant Secretary on December 29, 1989 (55 FR 1204) and is contained in the State's April 28, 2006, revised plan, which was approved by the Assistant Secretary on August 16, 2006.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In accordance with 29 CFR 1956.51(e), the State promulgated regulations for granting variances equivalent to 29 CFR part 1905 at 12 NYCRR Part 803, which were approved by the Assistant Secretary on December 29, 1989 (55 FR 1204).

Subsequently, the State's procedures were revised to provide that the

Commissioner of Labor, in consultation with the Hazard Abatement Board, or on his/her own initiative, can propose alternative or different occupational safety and health standards if a determination is made that an issue is not properly addressed by Federal OSHA standards and is necessary for the protection of public employees. The procedures for adoption of alternative standards contain criteria for development and consideration of expert technical knowledge in the field to be addressed by the standard and allow interested persons to submit information requesting development or promulgation of any standard and to participate in any hearing for the development, modification or establishment of standards. These procedures are contained in the April 28, 2006, revised plan, and were approved by the Assistant Secretary on August 16, 2006.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In accordance with 29 CFR 1956.51(j), the State has developed a Field Operations Manual which parallels Federal OSHA's Field Operations Manual, CPL 02-00-045 [CPL 2.45B], incorporates other Federal compliance policy directives, and contains procedures for unique State requirements.
