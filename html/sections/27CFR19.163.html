                                Sec. 19.163  Area operations bond.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Area operations bond covering multiple locations. A person who  operates more than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical  area serviced by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB an area  operations bond covering the operations of any two or more such plants  and any bonded wine cellars that are adjacent to such plants and which  otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. Area operations bonds  filed under this section will be in lieu of the operations bond  requirements for single distilled spirits plants under Sec. Sec. 19.161  and 19.166 and must contain the same terms and conditions as those  contained in separate bonds filed for single distilled spirits plants.  Any person who files an area operations bond may not allocate or divide  the penal sum of the area operations bond between the separate locations  and the total penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy  liability incurred at any of the covered locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Area operations bonds filed by corporations. An area operations  bond may only cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine  cellars that are operated by the same person. For purposes of this  section, a corporation and its controlled subsidiaries are considered to  be one person. Further, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation in  which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the  parent corporation. Consequently, an area operations bond may cover  distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars operated by a  parent corporation and one or more of its controlled subsidiaries. The  name of each corporation that operates a covered facility must appear on  the bond as a principal, whether the operating corporation is the parent  or a subsidiary. The bond must bear an authorized signature for each  operating corporation appearing on the bond.  (26 U.S.C. 5173)</p>
