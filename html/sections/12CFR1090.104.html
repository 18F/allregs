                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Market-Related definitions.</p><p class="depth2">Annual receipts means receipts calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Receipts means ``total income'' (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, ``gross income'') plus ``cost of goods sold'' as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return forms (such as Form 1120 for corporations; Form 1120S and Schedule K for S corporations; Form 1120, Form 1065 or Form 1040 for LLCs; Form 1065 and Schedule K for partnerships; Form 1040, Schedule C for sole proprietorships). Receipts do not include net capital gains or losses; taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income, such as sales or other taxes collected from customers and excluding taxes levied on the entity or its employees; and amounts collected for another (but fees earned in connection with such collections are receipts). Items such as subcontractor costs, reimbursements for purchases a contractor makes at a customer's request, and employee-based costs such as payroll taxes are included in receipts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Period of measurement. (A) Annual receipts of a person that has been in business for three or more completed

fiscal years means the total receipts of the person over its three most recently completed fiscal years divided by three.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Annual receipts of a person that has been in business for three or more completed

fiscal years means the total receipts of the person over its three most recently completed fiscal years divided by three.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Annual receipts of a person that has been in business for less than three completed fiscal years means the total receipts of the person for the period the person has been in business divided by the number of weeks in business, multiplied by 52.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Where a person has been in business for three or more completed fiscal years, but one of the years within its period of measurement is a short tax year, annual receipts means the total receipts for the short year and the two full fiscal or calendar years divided by the total number of weeks in the short year and the two full fiscal or calendar years, multiplied by 52.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual receipts of affiliated companies. (A) The annual receipts of a person are calculated by adding the annual receipts of the person with the annual receipts of each of its affiliated companies.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The annual receipts of a person are calculated by adding the annual receipts of the person with the annual receipts of each of its affiliated companies.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a person has acquired an affiliated company or been acquired by an affiliated company during the applicable period of measurement, the annual receipts of the person and the affiliated company are aggregated for the entire period of measurement (not just the period after the affiliation arose).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Receipts are calculated separately for the person and each of its affiliated companies in accordance with paragraph (ii) of this definition even though this may result in using a different period of measurement to calculate an affiliated company's annual receipts. Thus, for example, if an affiliated company has been in business for a period of less than three years, the affiliated company's receipts are to be annualized in accordance with paragraph (ii)(B) of this definition even if the person has been in business for three or more completed fiscal years.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The annual receipts of a formerly affiliated company are not included if affiliation ceased before the applicable period of measurement as set forth in paragraph (ii) of this definition. This exclusion of annual receipts of formerly affiliated companies applies during the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased.</p><p class="depth2">Consumer reporting means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Consumer reporting means collecting, analyzing, maintaining, or providing consumer report information or other account information used or expected to be used in any decision by another person regarding the offering or provision of any consumer financial product or service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusion for transaction and experience information. Consumer reporting does not include the activities of a person to the extent that a person collects, analyzes, maintains, or provides information that relates solely to the person's transactions or experiences with consumers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusion for furnishing affiliate information to a consumer reporting entity. Consumer reporting does not include the activities of a person to the extent that a person provides information that solely relates to transactions or experiences between a consumer and an affiliate of such person to another person that is engaged in consumer reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Exclusion for certain authorizations or approvals. Consumer reporting does not include any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Exclusion for providing information to be used solely in a decision regarding employment, government licensing, or residential leasing or tenancy. Consumer reporting does not include the activities of a person to the extent that a person provides consumer report or other account information that is used or expected to be used solely regarding a decision for employment, government licensing, or a residential lease or tenancy involving a consumer, or to be used solely in any decision regarding the offering or provision of a product or service that is not a consumer financial product or service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test to define larger participants. A nonbank covered person that offers or provides consumer reporting is a larger participant of the consumer reporting market if the person's annual receipts resulting from consumer reporting are more than $7 million.</p>
