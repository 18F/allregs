                                Sec. 776.9  General scope of ``in commerce'' coverage.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the definitions quoted above, it is clear that the employees  who are covered by the wage and hours provisions of the Act as employees  ``engaged in commerce'' are employees doing work involving or related to  the movement of persons or things (whether tangibles or intangibles, and  including information and intelligence) ``among the several States or  between any State and any place outside thereof.'' \23\ Although this  does not include employees engaged in activities which merely ``affect''  such interstate or foreign commerce, the courts have made it clear that  coverage of the Act based on engaging in commerce extends to every  employee employed ``in the channels of'' such commerce or in activities  so closely related to such commerce, as a practical matter, that they  should be considered a part of it. \24\ The courts have indicated that  the words ``in commerce'' should not be so limited by construction as to  defeat the purpose of Congress, but should be interpreted in a manner  consistent with their practical meaning and effect in the particular  situation. One practical question to be asked is whether, without the  particular service, interstate or foreign commerce would be impeded,  impaired, or abated; \25\ others are whether the service contributes  materially to the consummation of transactions in interstate or foreign  commerce \26\ or makes it possible for existing instrumentalities of  commerce \27\ to accomplish the movement of such commerce effectively  and to free it from burdens or obstructions. \28\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\23\ ``Any place outside thereof'' is not limited in meaning to  another State or country. Any movement between a State and a place  ``outside thereof'' is ``commerce'' for purposes of the Act, such as  ship-to-shore communication, or transportation out of a State by ship of  food, fuel, or ice to be consumed at sea before arrival at another port.</p><p class="depth0">\24\ Walling v.
