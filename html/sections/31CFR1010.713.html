                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director of FinCEN or his designee will not issue  administrative rulings in response to oral requests. Oral opinions or  advice by Treasury, Customs and Border Protection, the Internal Revenue  Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or any other  bank supervisory agency personnel, regarding the interpretation and  application of this chapter, do not bind FinCEN and carry no  precedential value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A person who has made a ruling request in conformity with Sec.  1010.711 may request an opportunity for oral discussion of the issues  presented in the request. The request should be made to the Director,  FinCEN, and any decision to grant such a conference is wholly within the  discretion of the Director. Personal conferences or telephone  conferences may be scheduled only for the purpose of affording the  requester an opportunity to discuss freely and openly the matters set  forth in the administrative ruling request. Accordingly, the conferees  will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to,  expressly or impliedly, during the conference. Any new arguments or  facts put forth by the requester at the meeting must be reduced to  writing by the requester and submitted in conformity with Sec. 1010.711  before they may be considered in connection with the request.</p>
