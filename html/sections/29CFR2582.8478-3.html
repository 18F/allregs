For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any reference to section 13 of the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, as amended (WPPDA), or any section thereof in the ERISA temporary bonding regulations shall be deemed to refer to section 8478 of FERSA or the corresponding subsection thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the particular phrases set forth in FERSA are not identical to the phrases in the WPPDA, ERISA or the ERISA temporary bonding regulations, the phrases appearing in FERSA shall be substituted by operation of law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the phrases are identical but the meaning is different, the meaning given such phrases by FERSA shall govern.
