Such priority consideration will also be given in the case of a borrower that has merged or consolidated with an electric system that has not previously received RUS financial assistance, if such system was serving primarily rural residents at the time of the merger or consolidation and such rural residents will continue to be served by the merged or consolidated system. RUS does not make loans for costs incurred in effectuating mergers or consolidations, such as legal expenses or feasibility study costs.</p>
