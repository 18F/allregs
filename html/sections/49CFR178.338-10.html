                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All valves, fittings, pressure relief devices and other  accessories to the tank proper, which are not isolated from the tank by  closed intervening shut-off valves or check valves, must be installed  within the motor vehicle framework or within a suitable collision  resistant guard or housing, and appropriate ventilation must be  provided. Each pressure relief device must be protected so that in the  event of the upset of the vehicle onto a hard surface, the device's  opening will not be prevented and its discharge will not be restricted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each protective device or housing, and its attachment to the  vehicle structure, must be designed to withstand static loading in any  direction that it may be loaded as a result of front, rear, side, or  sideswipe collision, or the overturn of the vehicle. The static loading  shall equal twice the loaded weight of the tank and attachments. A  safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material,  shall be used. The protective device or the housing must be made of  steel at least \3/16\-inch thick, or other material of equivalent  strength.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rear-end tank protection. Rear-end tank protections devices  must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consist of at least one rear bumper designed to protect the  cargo tank and piping in the event of a rear-end collision. The rear-end  tank protection device design must transmit the force of the collision  directly to the chassis of the vehicle. The rear-end tank protection  device and its attachments to the chassis must be designed to withstand  a load equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank and  attachments, using a safety factor of four based on the tensile strength  of the materials used, with such load being applied horizontally and  parallel to the major axis of the cargo tank. The rear-end tank  protection device dimensions must meet the requirements of Sec. 393.86  of this title and extend vertically to a height adequate to protect all  valves and fittings located at the rear of the cargo tank from damage  that could result in loss of lading; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conform to the requirements of Sec. 178.345-8(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Every part of the loaded cargo tank, and any associated valve,  pipe, enclosure, or protective device or structure (exclusive of wheel  assemblies), must be at least 14 inches above level ground.
