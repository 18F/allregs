This is accomplished by requiring that vessels provide information under established procedures as set forth in this part, or as directed by the Center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To avoid imposing an undue reporting burden or unduly congesting radiotelephone frequencies, reports shall be limited to information which is essential to achieve the objectives of the VMRS. These reports are consolidated into three reports (sailing plan, position, and final).
