Grantees that receive tentative approval of a waiver for more than two years under this paragraph must submit to the Secretary every two years by such time as the Secretary may direct documentation that demonstrates that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The significant economic hardship upon which the waiver was granted still exists; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The grantee tried diligently, but unsuccessfully, to obtain contributions

needed to meet the matching requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request in its application to match its contributions to its scholarship fund, established under section 404E of the HEA, on the basis of two non-Federal dollars for every one Federal dollar of GEAR UP funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary may approve a request by a Partnership applicant that has three or fewer institutions of higher education as members to waive up to 70 percent of the matching requirement if the Partnership applicant includes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fiscal agent that is eligible to receive funds under title V, or Part B of title III, or section 316 or 317 of the HEA, or a local educational agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only participating schools with a 7th grade cohort in which at least 75 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the Richard B.
