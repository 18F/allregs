                            <p class="depth0">If we become aware within 60 days of the date of our initial  determination or our decision following a case review or telephone  hearing, that a clerical error was made in determining whether or not  you are eligible for a subsidy (either in whole or in part), we may  issue a revised initial determination which would be effective back to  the date you originally filed your application or the effective date of  a subsidy changing event, provided you meet the requirements in  Sec. 418.3101. We may revise an initial determination or decision  regardless of whether such revised determination or decision is  favorable or unfavorable to you. If the revised determination or  decision (which is a new initial determination) is not favorable to you,  you will not be responsible for   paying back any subsidy received prior to the revised determination or  decision. We will mail you a notice of the revised determination which  will explain to you that we have made a revised determination and that  this determination replaces an earlier determination, how this  determination affects your subsidy eligibility, and your right to  request a hearing.</p>
