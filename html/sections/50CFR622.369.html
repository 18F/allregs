                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Migratory groups of king mackerel. In the EEZ, king mackerel are divided into the Gulf migratory group and the Atlantic migratory group. The Gulf migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the U.S./Mexico border and the summer/winter jurisdictional boundary. The Atlantic migratory group is bound by the summer/winter jurisdictional boundary and a line from the intersection point of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York (as described in Sec. 600.105(a) of this chapter). From April 1 through October 31, the summer jurisdictional boundary separates the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel by a line extending due west from the Monroe/Collier County, FL, boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the winter jurisdictional boundary separates the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel by a line extending due east from the Volusia/Flagler County, FL, boundary. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gulf migratory group. The Gulf migratory group is divided into western and eastern zones separated by a line extending due south from the Alabama/Florida border. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Western zone. The western zone encompasses an area of the EEZ north of a line extending east of the US/Mexico border, and west of a line extending due south of the Alabama/Florida border, including the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This zone remains the same year round.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eastern zone. The eastern zone is divided into the Florida west coast subzone and the Florida east coast subzone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Florida west coast subzone. The Florida west coast subzone is further divided into the northern and southern subzones by a line extending due west from the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Northern subzone. The northern subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ east of a line extending due south of the Florida/Alabama border, and north of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary, and remains the same area year round.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Southern subzone. From November 1 through March 31, the southern subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary on the Florida west coast, and south of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary on the Florida east coast, which includes the EEZ off Collier and Monroe Counties, FL. From April 1 through October 31, the southern subzone is reduced to the EEZ off Collier County, and the EEZ off Monroe County becomes part of the Atlantic migratory group area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Florida east coast subzone. From November 1 through March 31, the Florida east coast subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due east of the Flagler/Volusia County, FL, boundary, and north of a line extending due east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary. From April 1 through October 31, the Florida east coast subzone is not part of the Gulf migratory group king mackerel area; it is part of the Atlantic migratory group king mackerel area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Atlantic migratory group. The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern and southern zones separated by a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in Sec. 622.2. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See Sec. 622.385(a)(1) for a description of the areas for Atlantic migratory group king mackerel commercial trip limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Northern zone. The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in Sec. 600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in Sec. 622.2, including the EEZ off each state from North Carolina to New York. This zone remains the same year round.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Southern zone. From April 1 through October 31, the southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in Sec. 622.2, and south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in Sec. 622.2, and north of a line extending due east of the Flagler/Volusia County, FL, boundary.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 to Sec. 622.369--King Mackerel Description of Zones</p><p class="depth0">[For illustration, see Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Boundary 2</p><p class="depth0">Area                         Boundary 1       -------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Summer                   Winter----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gulf Migratory Group--Western Zone...
