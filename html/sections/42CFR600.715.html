                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Corrective action. When a question has been raised concerning  the authority for BHP trust fund expenditures in an OIG report, other  HHS compliance review, State audit or otherwise, the BHP trustees and  the State shall review the issues and develop a written response no  later than 60 days upon receipt of such a report, unless otherwise  specified in the report, review or audit. To the extent determined  necessary in that review, the BHP trustees and State shall implement  changes to fiscal procedures to ensure proper use of trust fund  resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restitution. To the extent that the State and BHP trustees  determine that BHP trust funds may not have been properly spent, they  must ensure restitution to the BHP trust fund of the funds in question.  Restitution may be made directly by the BHP trustees, by the State, or  by a liable third party. The State or the BHP trustees may enter into  indemnification agreements assigning liability for restitution of funds  to the BHP trust fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of restitution. Restitution to the BHP trust fund for any  unallowable expenditure may occur in a lump sum amount, or in equal  installment amounts. Restitution to the BHP trust fund cannot exceed a  2-year period from the date of the written response in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HHS disallowance of improper BHP trust fund expenditures. The  State shall return to HHS the amount of federal BHP funding that HHS has  determined was expended for unauthorized purposes, when no provision has  been made to restore the funding to the BHP trust fund in accordance  with paragraph (b) of this section (unless the restitution does not  comply with the timing conditions described in paragraphs (c) of this  section). When HHS determines that federal BHP funding is not allowable,  HHS will provide written notice to the state and BHP Trustees  containing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date or dates of the improper expenditures from the BHP  trust fund;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief written explanation of the basis for the determination  that the expenditures were improper; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for administrative reconsideration of the  disallowance based on a final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Administrative reconsideration of BHP trust fund disallowances.  (1) BHP Trustees or the State may request reconsideration of a  disallowance within 60 days after receipt of the disallowance notice  described in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section by submitting a written  request for review, along with any relevant evidence, documentation, or  explanation, to HHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After receipt of a reconsideration request, if the Secretary (or  a designated hearing officer) determines that further proceedings would  be warranted, the Secretary may issue a request for further information  by a specific date, or may schedule a hearing to obtain further evidence  or argument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary, or designee, shall issue a final decision within  90 days after the later of the date of receipt of the reconsideration  request or date of the last scheduled proceeding or submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Return of disallowed BHP funding. Disallowed federal BHP funding  must be returned to HHS within 60 days after the later of the date of  the disallowance notice or the final administrative reconsideration  upholding the disallowance. Such repayment cannot be made from BHP trust  funds, but must be made with other, non-Federal funds.</p><p class="depth2">PARTS 601	699 [RESERVED]     CHAPTER V--OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL-HEALTH CARE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</p><p class="depth2">AND HUMAN SERVICES</p><p class="depth2">--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Editorial Note: Nomenclature changes to chapter V appear at 66 FR  39452, July 31, 2001, and 67 FR 36540, May 24, 2002.</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER A--GENERAL PROVISIONS Part                                                                Page 1000            Introduction; general definitions...........         789</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER B--OIG AUTHORITIES 1001            Program integrity--Medicare and State health</p><p class="depth2">care programs...........................         792 1002            Program integrity--State-initiated</p><p class="depth2">exclusions from Medicaid................         841 1003            Civil money penalties, assessments and</p><p class="depth2">exclusions..............................         843 1004            Imposition of sanctions on health care</p><p class="depth2">practitioners and providers of health</p><p class="depth2">care services by a Quality Improvement</p><p class="depth2">Organization............................         859 1005            Appeals of exclusions, civil money penalties</p><p class="depth2">and assessments.........................         868 1006            Investigational inquiries...................         877 1007            State Medicaid fraud control units..........         878 1008            Advisory opinions by the OIG................         884 1009-1099</p><p class="depth2">[Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER A_GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
