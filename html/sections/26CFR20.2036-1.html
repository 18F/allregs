                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A decedent's gross estate includes under section  2036 the value of any interest in property transferred by the decedent  after March 3, 1931, whether in trust or otherwise, except to the extent  that the transfer was for an adequate and full consideration in money or  money's worth (see Sec. 20.2043-1), if the decedent retained or  reserved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For his life;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any period not ascertainable without reference to his death  (if the   transfer was made after June 6, 1932); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For any period which does not in fact end before his death:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The use, possession, right to income, or other enjoyment of the  transferred property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The right, either alone or in conjunction with any other person  or persons, to designate the person or persons who shall possess or  enjoy the transferred property or its income (except that, if the  transfer was made before June 7, 1932, the right to designate must be  retained by or reserved to the decedent alone).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Meaning of terms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A reservation by the decedent ``for any  period not ascertainable without reference to his death'' may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A decedent reserved the right to receive the income from  transferred property in quarterly payments, with the proviso that no  part of the income between the last quarterly payment and the date of  the decedent's death was to be received by the decedent or his estate;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example 1 and (c)(2)(iv) Example 8 of this  section. If the other person predeceased the decedent, the reservation  by the decedent may be considered to be either for life, or for a period  that does not in fact end before death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ``use, possession, right to the income, or other enjoyment  of the transferred property'' is considered as having been retained by  or reserved to the decedent to the extent that the use, possession,  right to the income, or other enjoyment is to be applied toward the  discharge of a legal obligation of the decedent, or otherwise for his  pecuniary benefit. The term ``legal obligation'' includes a legal  obligation to support a dependent during the decedent's lifetime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The phrase ``right * * * to designate the person or persons who  shall possess or enjoy the transferred property or the income  therefrom'' includes a reserved power to designate the person or persons  to receive the income from the transferred property, or to possess or  enjoy nonincome-producing property, during the decedent's life or during  any other period described in paragraph (a) of this section. With  respect to such a power, it is immaterial (i) whether the power was  exercisable alone or only in conjunction with another person or persons,  whether or not having an adverse interest; (ii) in what capacity the  power was exercisable by the decedent or by another person or persons in  conjunction with the decedent; and (iii) whether the exercise of the  power was subject to a contingency beyond the decedent's control which  did not occur before his death (e.g., the death of another person during  the decedent's lifetime). The phrase, however, does not include a power  over the transferred property itself which does not affect the enjoyment  of the income received or earned during the decedent's life. (See,  however, section 2038 for the inclusion of property in the gross estate  on account of such a power.) Nor does the phrase apply to a power held  solely by a person other than the decedent. But, for example, if the  decedent reserved the unrestricted power to remove or discharge a  trustee at any time and appoint himself as trustee, the decedent is  considered as having the powers of the trustee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Retained or reserved interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amount included in gross  estate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the decedent retained or reserved an interest  or right with respect to all of the property transferred by him, the  amount to be included in his gross estate under section 2036 is the  value of the entire property, less only the value of any outstanding  income interest which is not subject to the decedent's interest or right  and which is actually being enjoyed by another person at the time of the  decedent's death. If the decedent retained or reserved an interest or  right with respect to a part only of the property transferred by   him, the amount to be included in his gross estate under section 2036 is  only a corresponding proportion of the amount described in the preceding  sentence. An interest or right is treated as having been retained or  reserved if at the time of the transfer there was an understanding,  express, or implied, that the interest or right would later be  conferred. If this section applies to an interest retained by the  decedent in a trust or otherwise and the terms of the trust or other  governing instrument provide that, after the decedent's death, payments  the decedent was receiving during life are to continue to be made to the  decedent's estate for a specified period (as opposed to payments that  were payable to the decedent prior to the decedent's death but were not  actually paid until after the decedent's death), such payments that  become payable after the decedent's death are not includible in the  decedent's gross estate under section 2033 because they are properly  reflected in the value of the trust corpus included under this section.  Payments that become payable to the decedent prior to the decedent's  date of death, but are not paid until after the decedent's date of  death, are includible in the decedent's gross estate under section 2033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Decedent (D) creates an irrevocable inter vivos trust.  The terms of the trust provide that all of the trust income is to be  paid to D and D's child, C, in equal shares during their joint lives  and, on the death of the first to die of D and C, all of the trust  income is to be paid to the survivor. On the death of the survivor of D  and C, the remainder is to be paid to another individual, F.  Subsequently, D dies survived by C. Fifty percent of the value of the  trust corpus is includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1)  because, under the terms of the trust, D retained the right to receive  one-half of the trust income for D's life. In addition, the excess (if  any) of the value of the remaining 50 percent of the trust corpus, over  the present value of C's outstanding life estate in that 50 percent of  trust corpus, also is includible in D's gross estate under section  2036(a)(1), because D retained the right to receive all of the trust  income for such time as D survived C. If C had predeceased D, then 100  percent of the trust corpus would have been includible in D's gross  estate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. D transferred D's personal residence to D's child (C),  but retained the right to use the residence for a term of years. D dies  during the term. At D's death, the fair market value of the personal  residence is includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1)  because D retained the right to use the residence for a period that did  not in fact end before D's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retained annuity, unitrust, and other income interests in  trusts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (c)(2) applies to a grantor's  retained use of an asset held in trust or a retained annuity, unitrust,  or other interest in any trust (other than a trust constituting an  employee benefit) including without limitation the following  (collectively referred to in this paragraph (c)(2) as ``trusts''):  Certain charitable remainder trusts (collectively CRTs) such as a  charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT) within the meaning of section  664(d)(1), a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT) within the meaning of  section 664(d)(2) or (d)(3), and any charitable remainder trust that  does not qualify under section 664(d), whether because the CRT was  created prior to 1969, there was a defect in the drafting of the CRT,  there was no intention to qualify the CRT for the charitable deduction,  or otherwise; other trusts established by a grantor (collectively GRTs)  such as a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) paying out a qualified  annuity interest within the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-3(b) of this  chapter, a grantor retained unitrust (GRUT) paying out a qualified  unitrust interest within the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-3(c) of this  chapter; and various other forms of grantor retained income trusts  (GRITs) whether or not the grantor's retained interest is a qualified  interest as defined in section 2702(b), including without limitation a  qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) within the meaning of Sec.  25.2702-5(c) of this chapter and a personal residence trust (PRT) within  the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-5(b) of this chapter. If a decedent  transferred property into such a trust and retained or reserved the  right to use such property, or the right to an annuity, unitrust, or  other interest in such trust with respect to the property decedent so  transferred for decedent's life, any period not ascertainable without  reference to the decedent's death, or for a period that   does not in fact end before the decedent's death, then the decedent's  right to use the property or the retained annuity, unitrust, or other  interest (whether payable from income and/or principal) constitutes the  retention of the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income  from, the property for purposes of section 2036. The portion of the  trust's corpus includible in the decedent's gross estate for Federal  estate tax purposes is that portion of the trust corpus necessary to  provide the decedent's retained use or retained annuity, unitrust, or  other payment (without reducing or invading principal). In the case of a  retained annuity or unitrust, the portion of the trust's corpus  includible in the decedent's gross estate is that portion of the trust  corpus necessary to generate sufficient income to satisfy the retained  annuity or unitrust (without reducing or invading principal), using the  interest rates provided in section 7520 and the adjustment factors  prescribed in Sec. 20.2031-7 (or Sec. 20.2031-7A), if applicable. The  computation is illustrated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv), Examples 1, 2, and 3  of this section. The portion of the trust's corpus includible in the  decedent's gross estate under section 2036, however, shall not exceed  the fair market value of the trust's corpus at the decedent's date of  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Decedent's retained annuity following a current annuity  interest of another person. If the decedent retained the right to  receive an annuity or other payment (rather than income) after the death  of the current recipient of that interest, then the amount includible in  the decedent's gross estate under this section is the amount of trust  corpus required to produce sufficient income to satisfy the entire  annuity or other payment the decedent would have been entitled to  receive if the decedent had survived the current recipient (thus, also  including the portion of that entire amount payable to the decedent  before the current recipient's death), reduced by the present value of  the current recipient's interest. However, the amount includible shall  not be less than the amount of corpus required to produce sufficient  income to satisfy the annuity or other payment the decedent was  entitled, at the time of the decedent's death, to receive for each year.  In addition, in no event shall the amount includible exceed the value of  the trust corpus on the date of death. Finally, in calculating the  present value of the current recipient's interest, the exhaustion of  trust corpus test described in Sec. 20.7520-3(b)(2) (exhaustion test)  is not to be applied, even in cases where Sec. 20.7520-3(b)(2) would  otherwise require it to be applied. The following steps implement this  computation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Step 1: Determine the fair market value of the trust corpus on  the decedent's date of death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Step 2: Determine, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section, the amount of corpus required to generate sufficient  income to pay the annuity, unitrust, or other payment (determined on the  date of the decedent's death) payable to the decedent for the trust year  in which the decedent's death occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Step 3: Determine, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section, the amount of corpus required to generate sufficient  income to pay the annuity, unitrust, or other payment that the decedent  would have been entitled to receive for each trust year if the decedent  had survived the current recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Step 4: Determine the present value of the current recipient's  annuity, unitrust, or other payment (without applying the exhaustion  test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Step 5: Reduce the amount determined in Step 3 by the amount  determined in Step 4, but not to below the amount determined in Step 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Step 6: The amount includible in the decedent's gross estate  under this section is the lesser of the amounts determined in Step 5 and  Step 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Graduated retained interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For purposes of  this section, a graduated retained interest is the grantor's reservation  of a right to receive an annuity, unitrust, or other payment as  described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, payable at least  annually, that increases (but does not decrease) over a period of time,  not more often than annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other definitions--(1) Base amount. The base amount is the  amount of corpus required to generate the annuity,   unitrust, or other payment payable for the trust year in which the  decedent's death occurs. See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the  calculation of the base amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodic addition. The periodic addition in a graduated retained  interest for each year after the year in which decedent's death occurs  is the amount (if any) by which the annuity, unitrust, or other payment  that would have been payable for that year if the decedent had survived  exceeds the total amount of payments that would have been payable for  the year immediately preceding that year. For example, assume the trust  instrument provides that the grantor is to receive an annual annuity  payable to the grantor or the grantor's estate for a 5-year term. The  initial annual payment is $100,000, and each succeeding annual payment  is to be 120 percent of the amount payable for the preceding year.  Assuming the grantor dies in the second year of the trust (whether  before or after the due date of the second annual payment), the periodic  additions for years 3, 4, and 5 of the trust are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>      (2) Prior     (1-2)</p><p class="depth0">Annual       year      Periodic</p><p class="depth0">payment     payment    addition ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Year 3..............................     144,000     120,000      24,000 Year 4..............................     172,800     144,000      28,800 Year 5..............................     207,360     172,800      34,560 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corpus amount. For each trust year in which a periodic addition  occurs (increase year), the corpus amount is the amount of trust corpus  which, starting from the decedent's date of death, is necessary to  generate an amount of income sufficient to pay the periodic addition,  beginning in the increase year and continuing in perpetuity, without  reducing or invading principal. For each year with a periodic addition,  the corpus amount required as of the decedent's date of death is the  product of two factors: The first is the result of dividing the periodic  addition (adjusted for payments made more frequently than annually, if  applicable, and for payments due at the beginning, rather than the end,  of a payment period (see Table K or J of Sec. 20.2031-7(d)(6)) by the  section 7520 rate (periodic addition/rate)); and the second is 1 divided  by the sum of 1 and the section 7520 rate raised to the T power (1/(1 +  rate)[supcaret]T). The second factor applies a present value discount to  reflect the period beginning with the date of death and ending on the  last day of the trust year immediately before the year for which the  periodic addition is first payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The corpus amount is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08NO11.026</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The adjustment factor, if applicable, is the factor for  payments made more frequently than annually and for payments due at the  beginning, rather than the end, of a calendar period (see Table K or J  of Sec. 20.2031-7(d)(6)). T equals the time period in years from the  decedent's date of death through the last day of the trust year  immediately before the year for which the periodic addition is first  payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amount includible. The amount includible in the gross estate in  the case of a graduated retained interest is the sum of the base amount  and the corpus amount for each year for which a periodic addition is  first payable. The sum of these amounts represents the amount of trust  principal that would be necessary to generate the annual payments that  would have been paid to the decedent if the decedent had survived and  had continued to receive the graduated retained interest. The amount of  trust corpus includible in a decedent's gross estate under this section,  however, shall not exceed the fair market value of the trust corpus on  the decedent's date of death. The provisions of this section also apply  to graduated retained interests in transferred property not held in  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The application of paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii),  and (c)(2)(iii) of this section is illustrated in the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Decedent (D) transferred $100,000 to an inter vivos  trust that qualifies as a CRAT under section 664(d)(1). The trust  agreement provides for an annuity of $7,500 to be paid each year to D  for D's life, then to D's child (C) for C's life, with the remainder to  be distributed upon the survivor's death to N, a charitable organization  described in sections 170(c), 2055(a), and 2522(a). The annuity is  payable to D or C, as the case may be, annually on each December 31st. D  dies in September 2006, survived by C who was then age 40. On D's death,  the value of the trust assets was $300,000 and the section 7520 interest  rate was 6 percent. D's executor does not elect to use the alternate  valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of corpus with respect to which D retained the right  to the income, and thus the amount includible in D's gross estate under  section 2036, is that amount of corpus necessary to yield the annual  annuity payment to D (without reducing or invading principal). In this  case, the formula for determining the amount of corpus necessary to  yield the annual annuity payment to D is: annual annuity / section 7520  interest rate = amount includible under section 2036. The amount of  corpus necessary to yield the annual annuity is $7,500 / .06 = $125,000.  Therefore, $125,000 is includible in D's gross estate under section  2036(a)(1). (The result would be the same if D had retained an interest  in the CRAT for a term of years and had died during the term. The result  also would be the same if D had irrevocably relinquished D's annuity  interest less than 3 years prior to D's death because of the application  of section 2035.) If, instead, the trust agreement had provided that D  could revoke C's annuity interest or change the identity of the  charitable remainderman, see section 2038 with regard to the portion of  the trust to be included in the gross estate on account of such a  retained power to revoke. Under the facts presented, section 2039 does  not apply to include any amount in D's gross estate by reason of this  retained annuity. See Sec. 20.2039-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D transferred $100,000 to a GRAT in which D's annuity  is a qualified interest described in section 2702(b). The trust  agreement provides for an annuity of $12,000 per year to be paid to D  for a term of ten years or until D's earlier death. The annuity amount  is payable in twelve equal installments at the end of each month. At the  expiration of the term of years or on D's earlier death, the remainder  is to be distributed to D's child (C). D dies prior to the expiration of  the ten-year term. On the date of D's death, the value of the trust  assets is $300,000 and the section 7520 interest rate is 6 percent. D's  executor does not elect to use the alternate valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of corpus with respect to which D retained the right  to the income, and thus the amount includible in D's gross estate under  section 2036, is that amount of corpus necessary to yield the annual  annuity payment to D (without reducing or invading principal). In this  case, the formula for determining the amount of corpus necessary to  yield the annual annuity payment to D is: annual annuity (adjusted for  monthly payments) / section 7520 interest rate = amount includible under  section 2036. The Table K adjustment factor for monthly annuity payments  in this case is 1.0272. Thus, the amount of corpus necessary to yield  the annual annuity is ($12,000 x 1.0272) / .06 = $205,440. Therefore,  $205,440 is includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1). If,  instead, the trust agreement had provided that the annuity was to be  paid to D during D's life and to D's estate for the balance of the 10- year term if D died during that term, then the portion of trust corpus  includible in D's gross estate would still be as calculated in this  paragraph. It is not material whether payments are made to D's estate  after D's death. Under the facts presented, section 2039 does not apply  to include any amount in D's gross estate by reason of this retained  annuity. See Sec. 20.2039-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 2000, D created a CRUT within the meaning of  section 664(d)(2). The trust instrument directs the trustee to hold,  invest, and reinvest the corpus of the trust and to pay to D for D's  life, and then to D's child (C) for C's life, in equal quarterly  installments payable at the end of each calendar quarter, an amount  equal to 6 percent of the fair market value of the trust as valued on  December 15 of the prior taxable year of the trust. At the termination  of the trust, the then-remaining corpus, together with any and all  accrued income, is to be distributed to N, a charitable organization  described in sections 170(c), 2055(a), and 2522(a). D dies in 2006,  survived by C, who was then age 55. The value of the trust assets on D's  death was $300,000. D's executor does not elect to use the alternate  valuation date and, as a result, D's executor does not choose to use the  section 7520 interest rate for either of the two months prior to D's  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the corpus with respect to which D retained the  right to the income, and thus the amount includible in D's gross estate  under section 2036(a)(1), is that amount of corpus necessary to yield  the unitrust payments. In this case, such amount of corpus is determined  by dividing the trust's equivalent income interest rate by the section  7520 rate (which was 6 percent at the time of D's death). The equivalent  income interest rate is determined by dividing the trust's adjusted  payout rate by the excess of 1 over the adjusted payout rate. Based on  Sec. 1.664-4(e)(3) of this chapter, the appropriate adjusted payout  rate for the trust at D's death is 5.786 percent (6 percent x .964365).  Thus, the equivalent income interest rate is 6.141 percent (5.786  percent / (1--   5.786 percent)). The ratio of the equivalent interest rate to the  assumed interest rate under section 7520 is 102.35 percent (6.141  percent / 6 percent). Because this exceeds 100 percent, D's retained  payout interest exceeds a full income interest in the trust, and D  effectively retained the income from all the assets transferred to the  trust. Accordingly, because D retained for life an interest at least  equal to the right to all income from all the property transferred by D  to the CRUT, the entire value of the corpus of the CRUT is includible in  D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1). (The result would be the same  if D had retained, instead, an interest in the CRUT for a term of years  and had died during the term.) Under the facts presented, section 2039  does not apply to include any amount in D's gross estate by reason of  D's retained unitrust interest. See Sec. 20.2039-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If, instead, D had retained the right to a unitrust amount  having an adjusted payout for which the corresponding equivalent  interest rate would have been less than the 6 percent assumed interest  rate of section 7520, then a correspondingly reduced proportion of the  trust corpus would be includible in D's gross estate under section  2036(a)(1). Alternatively, if the interest retained by D was instead  only one-half of the 6 percent unitrust interest, then the amount  included in D's estate would be the amount needed to produce a 3 percent  unitrust interest. All of the results in this Example 3 would be the  same if the trust had been a GRUT instead of a CRUT.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. During life, D established a 15-year GRIT for the benefit  of individuals who are not members of D's family within the meaning of  section 2704(c)(2). D retained the right to receive all of the net  income from the GRIT, payable annually, during the GRIT's term. D dies  during the GRIT's term. D's executor does not elect to use the alternate  valuation date. In this case, the GRIT's corpus is includible in D's  gross estate under section 2036(a)(1) because D retained the right to  receive all of the income from the GRIT for a period that did not in  fact end before D's death. If, instead, D had retained the right to  receive 60 percent of the GRIT's net income, then 60 percent of the  GRIT's corpus would have been includible in D's gross estate under  section 2036. Under the facts presented, section 2039 does not apply to  include any amount in D's gross estate by reason of D's retained  interest. See Sec. 20.2039-1(e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. In 2003, D transferred $10X to a pooled income fund that  conforms to Rev. Proc. 88-53, 1988-2 CB 712 (1988) in exchange for 1  unit in the fund. D is to receive all of the income from that 1 unit  during D's life. Upon D's death, D's child (C), is to receive D's income  interest for C's life. In 2008, D dies. D's executor does not elect to  use the alternate valuation date. In this case, the fair market value of  D's 1 unit in the pooled income fund is includible in D's gross estate  under section 2036(a)(1) because D retained the right to receive all of  the income from that unit for a period that did not in fact end before  D's death. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. D transferred D's personal residence to a trust that met  the requirements of a qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) as set  forth in Sec. 25.2702-5(c) of this chapter. Pursuant to the terms of  the QPRT, D retained the right to use the residence for 10 years or  until D's prior death. D dies before the end of the term. D's executor  does not elect to use the alternate valuation date. In this case, the  fair market value of the QPRT's assets on the date of D's death are  includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1) because D  retained the right to use the residence for a period that did not in  fact end before D's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On November 1, year N, D transfers assets valued at  $2,000,000 to a GRAT. Under the terms of the GRAT, the trustee is to pay  to D an annuity for a 5-year term that is a qualified interest described  in section 2702(b). The annuity amount is to be paid annually at the end  of each trust year, on October 31st. The first annual payment is to be  $100,000. Each succeeding payment is to be 120 percent of the amount  paid in the preceding year. Income not distributed in any year is to be  added to principal. If D dies during the 5-year term, the payments are  to be made to D's estate for the balance of the GRAT term. At the end of  the 5-year term, the trust is to terminate and the corpus is to be  distributed to C, D's child. D dies on January 31st of the third year of  the GRAT term. On the date of D's death, the value of the trust corpus  is $3,200,000, the section 7520 interest rate is 6.8 percent, and the  adjustment factor from Table K of Sec. 20.2031-7 is 1.0000. D's  executor does not elect to value the gross estate as of the alternate  valuation date pursuant to section 2032.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount includible in D's gross estate under section  2036(a)(1) as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section is  determined and illustrated as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08NO11.027</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specifically:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Column A. First, determine the year of the trust term during  which the decedent's death occurs, and the number of subsequent years  remaining in the trust term for which the decedent retained or reserved  an interest. In this example, D dies during year 3, with two additional  years remaining in the term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Column B. Under the formula specified in the trust, the annuity  payment to be made on October 31st of the 3rd year of the trust term is  $144,000. Using that same formula, determine the annuity amounts for  years 4 and 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Column C. Determine the periodic addition for year 4 and year 5  by subtracting the annuity amount for the preceding year from the  annuity amount for that year; the periodic addition for that year is the  amount of the increase in the annuity amount for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Columns D through G for year 3. For the year of the decedent's  death (year 3), determine the principal required to produce the annuity  amount (Column D) by multiplying the annuity amount (Column B) by the  adjustment factor (in this case 1.0000) and by dividing the product by  the applicable interest rate under section 7520. Because this is the  year of decedent's death and reflects the annuity amount payable to the  decedent in that year, there is no deferral, so this is also the Base  Amount (the amount of corpus required to produce the annuity for year 3)  (Column G).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Columns D through G for years 4 and 5. For each succeeding year  of the trust term during which the periodic addition will not be payable  until a year subsequent to the year of the decedent's death, determine  the principal required to produce the periodic addition payable for that  year (Column D) by multiplying the periodic addition (Column C) by the  adjustment factor and by dividing the product by the applicable interest  rate under section 7520. Compute the factors to reflect the length of  the deferral period (Column E) and the present value (Column F) as  described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(3) of this section. Multiply the  amount of corpus in Column D by the factors in Columns E and F to  determine the Corpus Amount for that year (Column G).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Column G total. The sum of the amounts in Column G represents  the total amount includable in the gross estate (but not in excess of  the fair market value of the trust on the decedent's date of death).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An illustration of the amount of trust corpus (as of the  decedent's death) necessary to produce the scheduled payments is as  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08NO11.028</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A total corpus amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(3)  of this section) of $2,973,866 constitutes the principal required as of  decedent's date of death to produce (without reducing or invading  principal) the annual payments that D would have received if D had  survived and had continued to receive the retained annuity. Therefore,  $2,973,866 of the trust corpus is includible in D's gross estate under  section 2036(a)(1). The remaining $226,134 of the trust corpus is not  includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1). The result  would be the same if D's retained annuity instead had been payable to D  for a term of 5 years, or until D's prior death, at which time the GRAT  would have terminated and the trust corpus would have become payable to  another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If, instead, D's annuity was to have been paid on a monthly or  quarterly basis, then the periodic addition would have to be adjusted as  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(3) of this section. Specifically,  in Column D of the Table for years 4 and 5 in this example, the amount  of the principal required would be computed by multiplying the periodic  addition by the appropriate factor from Table K or J of Sec. 20.2031- 7(d)(6) before dividing as indicated and computing the amounts in  Columns E through G. In addition, Column D in year 3 also would have to  be so adjusted. Under the facts presented, section 2039 does not apply  to include any amount in D's gross estate by reason of this retained  interest. See Sec. 20.2039-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D creates an irrevocable inter vivos trust. The terms  of the trust provide that an annuity of $10,000 per year is to be paid  to D and C, D's child, in equal shares during their joint lives. On the  death of the first to die of D and C, the entire $10,000 annuity is to  be paid to the survivor for life. On the death of the survivor of D and  C, the remainder is to be paid to another individual, F. Subsequently, D  dies survived by C. On D's date of death, the fair market value of the  trust is $120,000 and the section 7520 rate is 7 percent. At the date of  D's death, the amount of trust corpus needed to produce D's annuity  interest ($5,000 per year) is $71,429 ($5,000/0.07). In addition, assume  the present value of C's right to receive $5,000 annually for the  remainder of C's life is $40,000. The portion of the trust corpus  includible in D's gross estate under section 2036(a)(1) is $102,857,  determined as follows:  (ii) Step 1: Fair market value of corpus..............          $120,000 (iii) Step 2: Corpus required to produce D's date of              71,429</p><p class="depth0">death annuity ($5,000/0.07)..........................
