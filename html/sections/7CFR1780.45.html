                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan closing. Notes and bonds will be completed on the date of  loan closing except for the entry of subsequent RUS multiple advances  where applicable. The amount of each note will be in multiples of not  less than $100. The amount of each bond will ordinarily be in multiples  of not less than $1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form RD 440-22, ``Promissory Note (Association or  Organization),'' will ordinarily be used for loans to nonpublic bodies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RUS Bulletins 1780-27, ``Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),'' or  1780-28, ``Loan Resolution Security Agreement,'' will be adopted by  public and other-than-public bodies. These resolutions supplement other  provisions in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subpart D of this part contains instructions for preparation of  notes and bonds evidencing indebtedness of public bodies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan disbursement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiple advances. Multiple advances will  be used only for loans in excess of $100,000. Advances will be made only  as needed to cover disbursements required by the borrower over a 30-day  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subpart D of this part contains instructions for making multiple  advances to public bodies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advances will be requested by the borrower in writing. The  request should be in sufficient amounts to pay cost of construction,  rights-of-way and land, legal, engineering, interest, and other expenses  as needed. The borrower may use Form RD 440-11, ``Estimate of Funds  Needed for 30 Day Period Commencing XXX,'' to show the amount of funds  needed during the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iv)</em>. If  all funds must be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing to  comply with State statutes, funds not needed at loan closing will be  handled as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Deposited in an appropriate borrower account, such as debt  service or construction accounts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deposited in a joint bank account under paragraph (e)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grant closing. RUS Bulletin 1780-12 ``Water or Waste System  Grant Agreement'' of this part will be completed and executed in  accordance with the requirements of grant approval. The grant will be  considered closed when RUS Bulletin 1780-12 has been properly executed.  Processing or approval officials are authorized to sign the grant  agreement on behalf of RUS. For grants that supplement RUS loan funds,  the grant should be closed simultaneously with the closing of the loan.  However, when grant funds will be disbursed before loan closing, as  provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the grant will be closed  not later than the delivery date of the first advance of grant funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant disbursements. RUS policy is not to disburse grant funds  from the Treasury until they are actually needed by the applicant.  Applicant funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS grant  funds. RUS loan funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS  grant funds except when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim financing of the total estimated amount of loan funds  needed during construction is arranged; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All interim funds have been disbursed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> RUS grant funds are needed before the RUS loan can be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use and accountability of funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Arrangements will be agreed  upon for the prior concurrence by the Agency of the bills or vouchers  upon which warrants will be drawn. Form RD 402-2,   ``Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,'' or similar form will be used  by the Agency to monitor funds. Periodic reviews of these accounts shall  be made by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pledge of collateral for grants to nonprofit organizations.  Grant funds must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage. Also, if the balance in the  account containing grant funds exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage, the  excess amount must be collaterally secured. The pledge of collateral for  the excess will be in accordance with Treasury Circular 176.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Joint RUS/borrower bank account. RUS funds and any funds  furnished by the borrower including contributions to purchase major  items of equipment, machinery, and furnishings will be deposited in a  joint RUS/borrower bank account if determined necessary by the approval  official. When RUS has a Memorandum of Understanding with another agency  that provides for the use of joint RUS/borrower accounts, or when RUS is  the primary source of funds for a project and has determined that the  use of a joint RUS/borrower bank account is necessary, project funds  from other sources may also be deposited in the joint bank account. RUS  shall not be accountable to the source of the other funds nor shall RUS  undertake responsibility to administer the funding program of the other  entity. Joint RUS/borrower bank accounts should not be used for funds  advanced by an interim lender. When funds exceeds the FDIC insurance  coverage, the excess must have a pledge of collateral in accordance with  Treasury Circular 176.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment for project costs. Project costs will be monitored by  the RUS processing office. Invoices will be approved by the borrower and  their engineer, as appropriate, and submitted to the processing office  for concurrence. The review and acceptance of project costs, including  construction pay estimates, by RUS does not attest to the correctness of  the amounts, the quantities shown or that the work has been performed  under the terms of the agreements or contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of remaining funds. Funds remaining after all costs incident  to the basic project have been paid or provided for will not include  applicant contributions. Funds remaining, may be considered in direct  proportion to the amounts obtained from each source. Remaining funds  will be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remaining funds may be used for eligible loan or grant purposes,  provided the use will not result in major changes to the facility(s) and  the purpose of the loan and grant remains the same;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RUS loan funds that are not needed will be applied as an extra  payment on the RUS indebtedness unless other disposition is required by  the bond ordinance, resolution, or State statute; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grant funds not expended under paragraph (f)(1) of this section  will be canceled. Prior to the actual cancellation, the borrower, its  attorney and its engineer will be notified of RUS's intent to cancel the  remaining funds. The applicant will be given appropriate appeal rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Post review of loan closing. In order to determine that the loan  has been properly closed the loan docket will be reviewed by OGC. The  State program official has the option to consult with OGC to obtain  waivers of this review.  [62 FR 33478, June 19, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 29946, June 4, 1999]    Sec. 1780.46  [Reserved]</p>
