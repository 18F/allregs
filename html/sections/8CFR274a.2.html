                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section establishes requirements and procedures for compliance by persons or entities when hiring, or when recruiting or referring for a fee, or when continuing to employ individuals in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recruiters and referrers for a fee. For purposes of complying with section 274A(b) of the Act and this section, all references to recruiters and referrers

for a fee are limited to a person or entity who is either an agricultural association, agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined in section 3 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, Pub. L. 97-470 (29 U.S.C. 1802)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Verification form. Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, is used in complying with the requirements of this 8 CFR 274a.1--274a.11. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) only, for a 2-year period starting from the transition program effective date (as defined in 8 CFR 1.1), the Form I-9 CNMI Employment Eligibility Verification Form must be used in lieu of Form I-9 in complying with the requirements of 8 CFR 274a.1 through 274a.11. Whenever ``Form I-9'' is mentioned in this title 8, ``Form I-9'' means Form I-9 or, when used in the CNMI for a 2-year period starting from the transition program effective date (as defined in 8 CFR 1.1), Form I-9 CNMI. Form I-9 can be in paper or electronic format. In paper format, the Form I-9 may be obtained in limited quantities at USCIS district offices, or ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, DC 20402. In electronic format, a fillable electronic Form I-9 may be downloaded from http://www.uscis.gov. Alternatively, Form I-9 can be electronically generated or retained, provided that the resulting form is legible; there is no change to the name, content, or sequence of the data elements and instructions; no additional data elements or language are inserted; and the standards specified under 8 CFR 274a.2(e), (f), (g), (h), and (i), as applicable, are met. When copying or printing the paper Form I-9, the text of the two-sided form may be reproduced by making either double-sided or single-sided copies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Attestation Under Penalty and Perjury. In conjunction with completing the Form I-9, an employer or recruiter or referrer for a fee must examine documents that evidence the identity and employment authorization of the individual. The employer or recruiter or referrer for a fee and the individual must each complete an attestation on the Form I-9 under penalty of perjury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employment verification requirements--(1) Examination of documents and completion of Form I-9.

Factors which would indicate that an individual has a reasonable expectation of employment include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual in question was employed by the employer on a regular and substantial basis. A determination of a regular and substantial basis is established by a comparison of other workers who are similarly employed by the employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The individual in question complied with the employer's established and published policy regarding his or her absence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The employer's past history of recalling absent employees for employment indicates a likelihood that the individual in question will resume employment with the employer within a reasonable time in the future;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The former position held by the individual in question has not been taken permanently by another worker;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The individual in question has not sought or obtained benefits during his or her absence from employment with the employer that are inconsistent with an expectation of resuming employment with the employer within a reasonable time in the future. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, severance and retirement benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The financial condition of the employer indicates the ability of the employer to permit the individual in question to resume employment within a reasonable time in the future; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The oral and/or written communication between employer, the employer's supervisory employees and the individual in question indicates that it is reasonably likely that the individual in question will resume employment with the employer within a reasonable time in the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retention and Inspection of Form I-9. (i) A paper (with original handwritten signatures), electronic (with acceptable electronic signatures that meet the requirements of paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section or original

paper scanned into an electronic format, or a combination of paper and electronic formats that meet the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section), or microfilm or microfiche copy of the original signed version of Form I-9 must be retained by an employer or a recruiter or referrer for a fee for the following time periods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of an employer, three years after the date of the hire or one year after the date the individual's employment is terminated, whichever is later; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a recruiter or referrer for a fee, three years after the date of the hire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any person or entity required to retain Forms I-9 in accordance with this section shall be provided with at least three business days notice prior to an inspection of Forms I-9 by officers of an authorized agency of the United States. At the time of inspection, Forms I-9 must be made available in their original paper, electronic form, a paper copy of the electronic form, or on microfilm or microfiche at the location where the request for production was made. If Forms I-9 are kept at another location, the person or entity must inform the officer of the authorized agency of the United States of the location where the forms are kept and make arrangements for the inspection. Inspections may be performed at an office of an authorized agency of the United States. A recruiter or referrer for a fee who has designated an employer to complete the employment verification procedures may present a photocopy or printed electronic image of the Form I-9 in lieu of presenting the Form I-9 in its original paper or electronic form or on microfilm or microfiche, as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Any refusal or delay in presentation of the Forms I-9 for inspection is a violation of the retention requirements as set forth in section 274A(b)(3) of the Act. No Subpoena or warrant shall be required for such inspection, but the use of such enforcement tools is not precluded. In addition, if the person or entity has not complied with a request to present the Forms I-9, any officer listed in 8 CFR 287.4 may compel production of the Forms I-9 and any other relevant documents by issuing a subpoena. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the subpoena power under section 235(d)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following standards shall apply to Forms I-9 presented on microfilm or microfiche submitted to an officer of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor: Microfilm, when displayed on a microfilm reader (viewer) or reproduced on paper must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. For this purpose, legibility is defined as the quality of a letter or numeral which enables the observer to positively and quickly identify it to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognizable as words or whole numbers. A detailed index of all microfilmed data shall be maintained and arranged in such a manner as to permit the immediate location of any particular record. It is the responsibility of the employer, recruiter or referrer for a fee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To provide for the processing, storage and maintenace of all microfilm, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To be able to make the contents thereof available as required by law. The person or entity presenting the microfilm will make available a reader-printer at the examination site for the ready reading, location and reproduction of any record or records being maintained on microfilm. Reader-printers made available to an officer of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor shall provide safety features and be in clean condition, properly maintained and in good working order. The reader-printers must have the capacity to display and print a complete page of information. A person or entity who is determined to have failed to comply with the criteria established by this regulation for the presentation of microfilm or microfiche to the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor, and at the time of the inspection does not present

a properly completed Form I-9 for the employee, is in violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 274a.2(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this section specify the standards for electronic Forms I-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Copying of documentation. An employer, or a recruiter or referrer for a fee may, but is not required to, copy or make an electronic image of a document presented by an individual solely for the purpose of complying with the verification requirements of this section. If such a copy or electronic image is made, it must either be retained with the Form I-9 or stored with the employee's records and be retrievable consistent with paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this section. The copying or electronic imaging of any such document and retention of the copy or electronic image does not relieve the employer from the requirement to fully complete section 2 of the Form I-9. An employer, recruiter or referrer for a fee should not, however, copy or electronically image only the documents of individuals of certain national origins or citizenship statuses. To do so may violate section 274B of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on use of Form I-9. Any information contained in or appended to the Form I-9, including copies or electronic images of documents listed in paragraph (c) of this section used to verify an individual's identity or employment eligibility, may be used only for enforcement of the Act and sections 1001, 1028, 1546, or 1621 of title 18, United States Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employment verification requirements in the case of hiring an individual who was previously employed. (1) When an employer hires an individual whom that person or entity has previously employed, if the employer has previously completed the Form I-9 and complied with the verification requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section with regard to the individual, the employer may (in lieu of completing a new Form I-9) inspect the previously completed Form I-9 and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When an employer hires an individual whom that person or entity has previously employed, if the employer has previously completed the Form I-9 and complied with the verification requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section with regard to the individual, the employer may (in lieu of completing a new Form I-9) inspect the previously completed Form I-9 and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the employer determines that the Form I-9 relates to the individual and that the individual is still eligible to work, that previously executed Form I-9 is sufficient for purposes of section 274A(b) of the Act if the individual is hired within three years of the date of the initial execution of the Form I-9 and the employer updates the Form I-9 to reflect the date of rehire; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the employer determines that the individual's employment authorization has expired, the employer must reverify on the Form I-9 in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii); otherwise the individual may no longer be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of retention of the Form I-9 by an employer for a previously employed individual hired pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the employer shall retain the Form I-9 for a period of three years commencing from the date of the initial execution of the Form I-9 or one year after the individual's employment is terminated, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Employment verification requirements in the case of recruiting or referring for a fee an individual who was previously recruited or referred.

(1) Any person or entity who is required by this section to complete and retain Forms I-9 may complete or retain electronically only those pages of the Form I-9 on which employers and employees enter data in an electronic generation or storage system that includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable controls to ensure the integrity, accuracy and reliability of the electronic generation or storage system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reasonable controls designed to prevent and detect the unauthorized or accidental creation of, addition to, alteration of, deletion of, or deterioration of an electronically completed or stored Form I-9, including the electronic signature if used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An inspection and quality assurance program evidenced by regular evaluations of the electronic generation or storage system, including periodic checks of the electronically stored Form I-9, including the electronic signature if used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of electronically retained Forms I-9, a retrieval system that includes an indexing system that permits searches consistent with the requirements of paragraph (e)(6) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The ability to reproduce legible and readable hardcopies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All documents reproduced by the electronic retention system must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability when displayed on a video display terminal or when printed on paper, microfilm, or microfiche. The term ``legibility'' means the observer must be able to identify all letters and numerals positively and quickly, to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. The term ``readability'' means that the observer must be able to recognize any group of letters or numerals that form words or numbers as those words or complete numbers. The employer, or recruiter or referrer for a fee, must ensure that the reproduction process maintains the legibility and readability of the electronically stored document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An electronic generation or storage system must not be subject, in whole or in part, to any agreement (such as a contract or license) that would limit or restrict access to and use of the electronic generation or storage system by an agency of the United States, on the premises of the employer, recruiter or referrer for a fee (or at any other place where the electronic generation or storage system is maintained), including personnel, hardware, software, files, indexes, and software documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A person or entity who chooses to complete or retain Forms I-9 electronically may use one or more electronic generation or storage systems. Each electronic generation or storage system must meet the requirements of this paragraph, and remain available as long as required by the Act and these regulations. Employers may implement new electronic storage systems provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All systems meet the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Existing Forms I-9 are retained in a system that remains fully accessible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For each electronic generation or storage system used, the person or entity retaining the Form I-9 must maintain, and make available upon request, complete descriptions of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The electronic generation and storage system, including all procedures relating to its use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The indexing system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An ``indexing system'' for the purposes of paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(5) of this section is a system that permits the identification and retrieval for viewing or reproducing of relevant documents and records maintained in an electronic storage system. For example, an indexing system might consist of assigning each electronically stored document a unique identification number and maintaining a separate database that contains descriptions of all electronically stored books and records along with their identification numbers. In addition, any system used to

maintain, organize, or coordinate multiple electronic storage systems is treated as an indexing system. The requirement to maintain an indexing system will be satisfied if the indexing system is functionally comparable to a reasonable hardcopy filing system. The requirement to maintain an indexing system does not require that a separate electronically stored documents and records description database be maintained if comparable results can be achieved without a separate description database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any person or entity choosing to retain completed Forms I-9 electronically may use reasonable data compression or formatting technologies as part of the electronic storage system as long as the requirements of 8 CFR 274a.2 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> At the time of an inspection, the person or entity required to retain completed Forms I-9 must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Retrieve and reproduce (including printing copies on paper, if requested) only the Forms I-9 electronically retained in the electronic storage system and supporting documentation specifically requested by an agency of the United States, along with associated audit trails.

(1) A person or entity who chooses to complete and/or retain Forms I-9 electronically must maintain and make available to an agency of the United States upon request documentation of the business processes that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person or entity who chooses to complete and/or retain Forms I-9 electronically must maintain and make available to an agency of the United States upon request documentation of the business processes that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Create the retained Forms I-9;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Modify and maintain the retained Forms I-9; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Establish the authenticity and integrity of the Forms I-9, such as audit trails.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Insufficient or incomplete documentation is a violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any officer listed in 8 CFR 287.4 may issue a subpoena to compel production of any documentation required by 8 CFR 274a.2. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the subpoena power of an agency of the United States under section 235(d)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Security. (1) Any person or entity who elects to complete or retain Forms I-9 electronically must implement an effective records security program that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any person or entity who elects to complete or retain Forms I-9 electronically must implement an effective records security program that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ensures that only authorized personnel have access to electronic records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides for backup and recovery of records to protect against information loss, such as power interruptions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensures that employees are trained to minimize the risk of unauthorized or accidental alteration or erasure of electronic records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure that whenever the electronic record is created, completed, updated, modified, altered, or corrected, a secure and permanent record is created that establishes the date of access, the identity of the individual who accessed the electronic record, and the particular action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An action or inaction resulting in the unauthorized alteration, loss, or erasure of electronic records, if it is known, or reasonably should be known, to be likely to have that effect, is a violation of section 274A(b)(3) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Electronic signatures for employee.(1) If a Form I-9 is completed electronically, the attestations in Form I-9 must be completed using a system for capturing an electronic signature that meets the standards set forth in this paragraph.
