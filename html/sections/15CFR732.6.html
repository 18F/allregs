Other portions of the EAR  impose other obligations and requirements. Some of them are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements relating to the use of a license in Sec. 758.4 of  the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obligations of carriers, forwarders, exporters and others to  take specific steps and prepare and deliver certain documents to assure  that items subject to the EAR are delivered to the destination to which  they are licensed or authorized by a License Exception or some other  provision of the regulations in Sec. 758.1 through Sec. 758.6 of the  EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duty of carriers to return or unload shipments at the direction  of U.S. Government officials (see Sec. 758.8 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific obligations imposed on parties to Special Comprehensive  licenses in part 752 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping requirements imposed in part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements of part 764 of the EAR to disclose facts that may  come to your attention after you file a license application or make  other statements to the government concerning a transaction or proposed  transaction that is subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certain obligations imposed by part 760 of the EAR on parties  who receive requests to take actions related to foreign boycotts and  prohibits certain actions relating to those boycotts.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 732--Decision Tree [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06FE04.000   [69 FR 5687, Feb. 6, 2004]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 2 to Part 732--Subject to the Ear? [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06FE04.001   [69 FR 5687, Feb. 6, 2004]     Sec. Supplement No. 3 to Part 732--BIS's ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance</p><p class="depth0">and Red Flags</p><p class="depth0">``Know Your Customer'' Guidance</p><p class="depth0">Various requirements of the EAR are dependent upon a person's  knowledge of the end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, or other facts  relating to a transaction or activity. These provisions include the  nonproliferation-related ``catch-all'' sections and the prohibition  against proceeding with a transaction with knowledge that a violation of  the EAR has occurred or is about to occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BIS provides the following guidance on how individuals and firms  should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance does not change  or interpret the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Decide whether there are ``red flags''. Take into account any  abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that the export  may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, or destination.  Such circumstances are referred to as ``red flags''. Included among  examples of red flags are orders for items that are inconsistent with  the needs of the purchaser, a customer declining installation and  testing when included in the sales price or when normally requested, or  requests for equipment configurations that are incompatible with the  stated destination (e.g., 120 volts in a country with 220 volts).  Commerce has developed lists of such red flags that are not all- inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types of circumstances that  should cause reasonable suspicion that a transaction will violate the  EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there are ``red flags'', inquire. If there are no ``red  flags'' in the information that comes to your firm, you should be able  to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information you have  received. That is, absent ``red flags'' (or an express requirement in  the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exporters to inquire,  verify, or otherwise ``go behind'' the customer's representations.  However, when ``red flags'' are raised in information that comes to your  firm, you have a duty to check out the suspicious circumstances and  inquire about the end-use, end-user, or ultimate country of destination.  The duty to check out ``red flags'' is not confined to the use of  License Exceptions affected by the ``know'' or ``reason to know''  language in the EAR. Applicants for licenses are required by part 748 of  the EAR to obtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, and  misrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited, both  in the licensing process and in all export control documents. You can  rely upon representations from your customer and repeat them in the  documents you file unless red flags oblige you to take verification  steps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of information that  comes to your firm in the normal course of business. For example, do not  instruct the sales force to tell potential customers to refrain from  discussing the actual end-use, end-user, and ultimate country of  destination for the product your firm is seeking to sell. Do not put on  blinders that prevent the learning of relevant information. An  affirmative policy of steps to avoid ``bad'' information would not  insulate a company from liability, and it would usually be considered an  aggravating factor in an enforcement proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employees need to know how to handle ``red flags''. Knowledge  possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to a firm so as to  make it liable for a violation. This makes it important for firms to  establish clear policies and effective compliance procedures to ensure  that such knowledge about transactions can be evaluated by responsible  senior officials. Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self- blinding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry. The purpose of  this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the ``red flags''  can be explained or justified. If they can, you may proceed with the  transaction. If the ``red flags'' cannot be explained or justified and  you proceed, you run the risk of having had ``knowledge'' that would  make your action a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Refrain from the transaction or advise BIS and wait. If you  continue to have reasons for concern after your inquiry, then you should  either refrain from the transaction or submit all the relevant  information to BIS in the form of an application for a license or in  such other form as BIS may specify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Industry has an important role to play in preventing exports and  reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests  of the United States. BIS will continue to work in partnership with  industry to make this front line of defense effective, while minimizing  the regulatory burden on exporters. If you have any question about  whether you have encountered a ``red flag'', you may contact the Office  of Export Enforcement at 1-800-424-2980 or the Office of Exporter  Services at (202) 482-4532.</p><p class="depth2">Red Flags</p><p class="depth2">Possible indicators that an unlawful diversion might be planned by  your customer include the following:</p><p class="depth2">1. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer  information about the end-use of a product.</p><p class="depth2">2. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of  business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several  sophisticated lasers.</p><p class="depth2">3. The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level of  the country to   which the product is being shipped. For example, semiconductor  manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a country without an  electronics industry.</p><p class="depth2">4. The customer has little or no business background.</p><p class="depth2">5. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item  when the terms of the sale call for financing.</p><p class="depth2">6. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance  characteristics but still wants the product.</p><p class="depth2">7. Routine installation, training or maintenance services are  declined by the customer.</p><p class="depth2">8. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of- the-way destinations.</p><p class="depth2">9. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final  destination.</p><p class="depth2">10. The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.</p><p class="depth2">11. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or  destination.</p><p class="depth2">12. When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether  the purchased product is for domestic use, export or reexport.</p><p class="depth2">13. You receive an order for ``parts'' or ``components'' for an end  item in 9x515 or the ``600 series.'' The requested ``parts'' or  ``components'' may be eligible for License Exception STA, another  authorization, or may not require a destination-based license  requirement for the country in question. However, the requested  ``parts'' or ``components'' would be sufficient to service one hundred  of the 9x515 or ``600 series'' end items, but you ``know'' the country  does not have those types of end items or only has two of those end  items.</p><p class="depth2">14. The customer indicates or the facts pertaining to the proposed  export suggest that a 9x515 or ``600 series'' item may be reexported to  a destination listed in Country Group D:5 (see Supplement No. 1 to part  740 of the EAR).
