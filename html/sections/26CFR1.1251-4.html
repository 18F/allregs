                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exception for gifts--(1) General rule. Section 1251(d)(1)  provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1251(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> upon  a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph, the term gift  shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1245-4 and,  with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles  illustrated by the examples of paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1245-4 shall  apply. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a  gift of farm recapture property, see section 170(e) and Sec. 1.170A-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift. Where  a disposition of farm recpature property is in part a sale or exchange  and in part a gift, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income  under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of farm recapture property other than land, the  excess of the amount realized over adjusted basis, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of Sec. 1.1251-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of land in hand of transferee. See paragraph (g) of  this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of  land to which this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a calendar year taxpayer, makes one disposition of  farm recapture property during 1976. On March 2, 1976, A makes a gift to  B (also a calendar year taxpayer) of a parcel of land which he had on  January 15, 1971. On the date of such disposition, the excess of the  fair market value ($65,000) over the adjusted basis of the land  ($40,000) is $25,000 and the sum of the deductions allowable in respect  of such land under sections 175 and 182 is $21,000 for 1971 and $3,000  (attributable to 1975) for the taxable year of disposition and the four  immediately preceding taxable years. Thus, the potential gain (as  defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1251-1) is limited to $3,000.  At the end of 1976 (after making the applicable additions and  subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)), there is a balance  in A's excess deductions account of $25,000. However, upon making the  gift, A recognizes no gain under section 1251(c)(1) or section  1252(a)(1). See subparagraph (a)(1) of this paragraph and paragraph  (a)(1) of Sec. 1.1252-2. For treatment of the land in the hands of B,  see example (1) of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For effect of the  gift on the excess deductions accounts of A and B, see paragraph (e)(2)  of Sec. 1.1251-2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that A  transfers the land to B for $50,000. Thus, the gain realized is $10,000  (amount realized, $50,000, minus adjusted basis $40,000), and A has made  a gift of $15,000 (fair market value, $65,000, minus amount realized,  $50,000). Since under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the  potential gain ($3,000) is lower than the gain realized ($10,000), the  gain to which section 1251(c)(1) could apply is limited by subparagraph  (2)(ii) of this paragraph to $3,000. Thus, as A has $25,000 in his  excess deductions account, $3,000 is recognized as ordinary income under  section 1251(c)(1). See example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 1.1252- 2 for computation of gain of $7,000 which is recognized as ordinary  income by A under section 1252(a)(1). For treatment of the land in the  hands of B, see example (2) of paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception for transfers at death--(1) General rule. Section  1251(d)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to  income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under  section 1251(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term transfer at death shall have the same meaning as in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of  this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph  (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1245-4 shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of land in hands of transferee. If as of the date a  person acquires land which is farm recapture property from a decedent  such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of  section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the  property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date  provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then on  such date the potential gain in respect to such land is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. Section 1251(d)(3) does not apply to a  disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative  described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by  chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfers covered. The transfers referred to in subparagraphs  (1) of this paragraph are transfers of farm recapture property in which  the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined  by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of  the application of any of the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation  of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For the  application of section 1251(d)(3) to such a complete liquidation, the  principles of paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, for  example, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not  apply to a liquidating distribution of farm recapture property by an 80- percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's  basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by  reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 351 (relating to transfer to corporation controlled by  transferor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 351 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  corporate reorganizations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  railroad reorganizations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partnerships. For the application of section 1251 to  partnerships, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of land in hands of transferee. See paragraph (g) of  this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of  land to which this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, makes one  disposition of farm recapture property during 1971. On January 20, 1971.  A transfers farm recapture property (other than land and section 1245  property), having an adjusted basis of $22,000, to corporation M in  exchange for stock in M worth $35,000 plus $15,000 in cash in a  transaction qualifying under section 351. Thus, the amount realized is  $50,000, and the gain realized is the excess of the amount realized,  $50,000, over the adjusted basis, $22,000, or $28,000. Without regard to  section 1251, A would recognize gain of $15,000 under section 351(b),  and M's basis for the farm recapture property would be determined under  section 362(a) by reference to its basis in the hands of A. Assume  further that the balance in A's excess deductions account (after making  the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and  (3)(A)) at the close of 1971 is $20,000. Thus, since such balance in the  excess deductions account ($20,000) is lower than the gain realized  ($28,000), is subparagraph (1) of this paragraph did not apply, gain of  $20,000 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1).  However, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph limits the amount of gain to  be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) to $15,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of Sec. 1.1251-3. For  treatment of the property received by A in such transaction; see section  1251(d)(6) and paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in subdivision (i) of example  (1), except that the farm recapture property is section 1245 property.  Assume further than $5,000 is recognized as ordinary income under  section 1245(a)(1), and that as of the close of 1971, A has a balance of  $15,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the applicable  additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A) which,  under paragraph   (b) of Sec. 1.1251-3, is computed by treating the $5,000 of gain to  which section 1245 applies as gross income derived from the trade or  business of farming). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income  under section 1251(c)(1) is $10,000, computed as follows:  (1) Amount of gain under section 1251(c)(1) (determined</p><p class="depth0">without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph):......</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Portion of gain realized ($28,000) in excess of          $23,000</p><p class="depth0">amount recognized as ordinary income under section</p><p class="depth0">1245(a)(1) ($5,000).....................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Excess deductions account balance....................     15,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Lower of (a) or (b)..................................     15,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (2) Limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gain recognized (determined without regard to section     15,000</p><p class="depth0">1251)...................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under            5,000</p><p class="depth0">section 1245(a)(1)......................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Difference...........................................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Lower of line (1)(c) or line (2)(c)..................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(4)</em>, if farm recapture property  is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1251) is  not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like  kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions),  then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor  under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess  (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized on such disposition  (determined without regard to section 1251) or (ii) the amount (if any)  of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns a herd  of breeding cattle having an adjusted basis of $75,000 which he acquired  on March 30, 1970, A receives insurance proceeds of $90,000. Thus, the  gain realized is $15,000 (that is, the excess of the amount realized,  $75,000), A makes no other disposition of farm recapture property during  1970. Assume that had the herd been sold at its fair market value on  March 15, 1970, no gain would have been recognized as ordinary income  under section 1245(a)(1). As of the close of 1970, A has a balance of  $12,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the applicable  additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)). Thus,  since the balance in the excess deductions account, $12,000, is lower  than the gain realized, $15,000, the amount of gain which would be  recognized under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) would be $12,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(b)</em> of Sec.  1.1251-3 as farm recapture property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns land  which he had acquired on March 7, 1970, having an adjusted basis of  $48,000, and a fair market value of $67,500. On January 15, 1975, A, as  a result of a condemnation action, receives $67,500 (its fair market  value) for the land. The aggregate of the deductions allowable in  respect of such land under sections 175 and 182 is $18,000, with $5,000  of such aggregate attributable to 1970 and $13,000 of such aggregate  attributable to 1970 and $13,000 of such aggregate attributable to 1975  and the four preceding taxable years. Thus, the potential gain (as  defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1251-1) is limited to  $13,000, since that amount is lower than $19,500 (the excess of the fair  market value of the land, $67,500, over its adjusted basis, $48,000).  The gain realized by A is also $19,500. At the end of A's taxable year  (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section  1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)) there is a balance of $21,000 in the excess  deductions account of A. Since the potential gain, $13,000, is lower  than both the excess deductions account balance, $21,000, and the gain  realized, $19,500, A would recognize $13,000 as ordinary income under  section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(b)</em> of Sec. 1.1251-3 as farm  recapture property. See example (1) of paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1252- 2 for a computation of gain recognized as ordinary income under section  1252(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. B, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns a herd of  breeding cattle having an adjusted basis of $25,000 which he acquired on  March 30, 1970. On March 15, 1976, the entire herd is destroyed by a  blizzard and on March 20, 1976, B receives insurance proceeds of  $90,000. Thus, the gain realized is $65,000 (that is, the excess of the  amount realized, $90,000, over the adjusted basis, $25,000). B makes no  other disposition of farm recapture property during 1976. B spends  $60,000 of the insurance proceeds to purchase another breeding herd and  retains cash of $30,000. The acquisition by B qualifies under section  1033(a)(3)(A), and B properly elects under section 1033(a)(3)(A) and the  regulations thereunder to limit recognition of gain to $30,000 (that is,  the amount by which the amount realized from the conversion, $90,000,  exceeds the cost of the property acquired to replace the converted  property, $60,000). Assume that the amount of gain recognized under  section 1245(a)(1) is $20,000, and that as of the close of 1976 B has a  balance of $100,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the  applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and  (3)(A) which, under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1251-3, is computed by  treating the $20,000 of gain to which section 1245 applies as gross  income derived from the trade or business of farming). The amount of  gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) is $10,000,  computed as follows:  (1) Amount of gain under section 1251(c)(1) (determined</p><p class="depth0">without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Portion of gain realized ($65,000) in excess of          $45,000</p><p class="depth0">amount recognized as ordinary income under section</p><p class="depth0">1245(a)(1) ($20,000)....................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Excess deductions account balance....................    100,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Lower of (a) or (b)..................................     45,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (2) Limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gain recognized (determined without regard to section     30,000</p><p class="depth0">1251)...................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under          $20,000</p><p class="depth0">section 1245(a)(1)......................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Difference...........................................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (3) Lower of line (1)(c) or line (2)(c)......................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application to single disposition of farm recapture property of  one class and property of different class. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If upon a sale of farm  recapture property of one class gain would be recognized under section  1251(c)(1), and if such farm recapture property together with property  of a different class or classes is disposed of in a single transaction  in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031  (without regard to section 1251(c)(1), then rules consistent with the  principles of paragraph (d)(6) of Sec. 1.1250-3 (relating to gain from  disposition of certain depreciable realty) shall apply for purposes of  allocating the amount realized to each of the classes of property  disposed of and for purposes of determining what property the amount  realized for each class consists of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of property  other than farm recapture property are (a) section 1245 property, (b)  section 1250 property, and (c) other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of farm  recapture property are (a) hand, (b) farm recapture property other than  land which is section 1245 property and (c) farm recapture property  other than land which is not section 1245 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of land received in like kind exchange or involuntary  conversion.
