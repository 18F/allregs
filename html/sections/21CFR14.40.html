                                Sec. 14.40  Establishment and renewal of advisory committees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An advisory committee may be established or renewed whenever it  is necessary or appropriate for the committee to hold a public hearing  and to review and make recommendations on any matter pending before FDA.  Except for committees established by statute, before a committee is  established or renewed it must first be approved by the Department  pursuant to 45 CFR part 11 and by the General Services Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an advisory committee is established or renewed, the  Commissioner will issue a Federal Register notice certifying that the  establishment or renewal is in the public interest and stating the  structure, function, and purposes of the committee and, if it is a  standing advisory committee, shall amend Sec. 14.100 to add it to the  list of standing advisory committees. A notice of establishment will be  published at least 15 days before the filing of the advisory committee  charter under paragraph (c) of this section. A notice of renewal does  not require the 15-day notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of the Federal Advisory  Committee Act. This requirement is to be met by an advisory committee  utilized by FDA, even though it is not established by the agency, prior  to utilization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The regulations of the Department cited in paragraph (a) of this  section provide that the charter of a parent committee may incorporate  information concerning activities of a subgroup. In such instances, a  subgroup will not be established as a committee distinct from the parent  committee. However, a subgroup will be established as a separate  committee when the charter of the parent committee does not incorporate  the activities of the subgroup, or when the subgroup includes members  who are not all drawn from the parent committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An advisory committee not required to be established by law will  be established or utilized only if it is in the public interest and only  if its functions cannot reasonably be performed by other existing  advisory committees or by FDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An advisory committee must meet the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Its purpose is clearly defined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Its membership is balanced fairly in terms of the points of view  represented in light of the functions to be performed. Although  proportional representation is not required, advisory committee members  are selected without regard to race, color, national origin, religion,  age, or sex.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is constituted and utilizes procedures designed to assure  that its advice and recommendations are the result of the advisory  committee's independent judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Its staff is adequate. The Commissioner designates an Designated  Federal Officer and alternate for every advisory committee, who are  employees of FDA. The Designated Federal Officer   is responsible for all staff support unless other agency employees are  designated for this function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whenever feasible, or required by statute, it includes  representatives of the public interest.  [44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 55 FR 42703, Oct. 23, 1990]</p>
