                                Sec. 401.105  Disclosure of personal information without the consent
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SSA maintains two categories of records which contain personal  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonprogram records, primarily administrative and personnel  records which contain information about SSA's activities as a government  agency and employer, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Program records which contain information about SSA's clients  that it keeps to administer benefit programs under Federal law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We apply different levels of confidentiality to disclosures of  information in the categories in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this  section. For administrative and personnel records, the Privacy Act  applies. To the extent that SSA has physical custody of personnel  records maintained as part of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM)  Privacy Act government-wide systems of records, these records are  subject to OPM's rules on access and disclosure at 5 CFR parts 293 and  297. For program records, we apply somewhat more strict confidentiality  standards than those found in the Privacy Act. The reason for this  difference in treatment is that our program records include information  about a much greater number of persons than our administrative records,  the information we must collect for program purposes is often very  sensitive, and claimants are required by statute and regulation to  provide us with the information in order to establish entitlement for  benefits.
