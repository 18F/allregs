                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. A Board-regulated institution must comply with this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a depository institution that is subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. A Board-regulated institution must make timely public disclosures each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the Board-regulated institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a Board-regulated institution believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the Board-regulated institution is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed. The Board-regulated institution's management may provide all of the disclosures required by this section

in one place on the Board-regulated institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the Board-regulated institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure policy. The Board-regulated institution must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses the Board-regulated institution's approach for determining its market risk disclosures. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. One or more senior officers of the Board-regulated institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart, and the board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Quantitative disclosures. (1) For each material portfolio of covered positions, the Board-regulated institution must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least quarterly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each material portfolio of covered positions, the Board-regulated institution must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least quarterly:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The high, low, and mean VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the VaR-based measure at period-end;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The high, low, and mean stressed VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the stressed VaR-based measure at period-end;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The high, low, and mean incremental risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the incremental risk capital requirement at period-end;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The high, low, and mean comprehensive risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the comprehensive risk capital requirement at period-end, with the period-end requirement broken down into appropriate risk classifications (for example, default risk, migration risk, correlation risk);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Separate measures for interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk used to calculate the VaR-based measure; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A comparison of VaR-based estimates with actual gains or losses experienced by the Board-regulated institution, with an analysis of important outliers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, the Board-regulated institution must disclose publicly the following information at least quarterly:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet securitization positions by exposure type; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of correlation trading positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Qualitative disclosures. For each material portfolio of covered positions, the Board-regulated institution must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, or more frequently in the event of material changes for each portfolio:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The composition of material portfolios of covered positions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board-regulated institution's valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for covered positions including, for securitization positions, the methods and key assumptions used for valuing such positions, any significant changes since the last reporting period, and the impact of such change;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The characteristics of the internal models used for purposes of this subpart. For the incremental risk capital requirement and the comprehensive risk capital requirement, this must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The approach used by the Board-regulated institution to determine liquidity horizons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The methodologies used to achieve a capital assessment that is consistent with the required soundness standard; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The specific approaches used in the validation of these models;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the approaches used for validating and evaluating the

accuracy of internal models and modeling processes for purposes of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each market risk category (that is, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk), a description of the stress tests applied to the positions subject to the factor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The results of the comparison of the Board-regulated institution's internal estimates for purposes of this subpart with actual outcomes during a sample period not used in model development;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The soundness standard on which the Board-regulated institution's internal capital adequacy assessment under this subpart is based, including a description of the methodologies used to achieve a capital adequacy assessment that is consistent with the soundness standard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A description of the Board-regulated institution's processes for monitoring changes in the credit and market risk of securitization positions, including how those processes differ for resecuritization positions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A description of the Board-regulated institution's policy governing the use of credit risk mitigation to mitigate the risks of securitization and resecuritization positions.
