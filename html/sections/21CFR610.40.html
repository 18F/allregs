                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Human blood and blood components. Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you, an establishment that collects blood or blood components, must test each donation of human blood or blood component intended for use in preparing a product, including donations intended as a component of, or used to prepare, a medical device, for evidence of infection due to the following communicable disease agents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Human immunodeficiency virus, type 2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hepatitis B virus;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hepatitis C virus;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Human T-lymphotropic virus, type I; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Human T-lymphotropic virus, type II.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing using one or more approved screening tests. To test for evidence of infection due to communicable disease agents designated in paragraph (a) of this section, you must use screening tests that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for such use, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. You must perform one or more such tests as necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of communicable disease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to testing for allogeneic transfusion or further manufacturing use--(1) Dedicated donations. (i) You must test donations of human blood and blood components from a donor whose donations are dedicated to and used solely by a single identified recipient under paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) of this section; except that, if the donor makes multiple donations for a single identified recipient, you may perform such testing only on the first donation in each 30-day period. If an untested dedicated donation is made available for any use other than transfusion to the single, identified recipient, then this exemption from the testing required under this section no longer applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dedicated donations. (i) You must test donations of human blood and blood components from a donor whose donations are dedicated to and used solely by a single identified recipient under paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) of this section; except that, if the donor makes multiple donations for a single identified recipient, you may perform such testing only on the first donation in each 30-day period. If an untested dedicated donation is made available for any use other than transfusion to the single, identified recipient, then this exemption from the testing required under this section no longer applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must test donations of human blood and blood components from a donor whose donations are dedicated to and used solely by a single identified recipient under paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) of this section; except that, if the donor makes multiple donations for a single identified recipient, you may perform such testing only on the first donation in each 30-day period. If an untested dedicated donation is made available for any use other than transfusion to the single, identified recipient, then this exemption from the testing required under this section no longer applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each donation must be labeled as required under Sec. 606.121 of this chapter and with a label entitled ``INTENDED RECIPIENT INFORMATION LABEL'' containing the name and identifying information of the recipient.

You are not required to test samples of blood, blood components, plasma, or sera if used or distributed for clinical laboratory testing or research purposes and not intended for administration to humans or in the manufacture of a product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Autologous donations. You, an establishment that collects human blood or blood components from autologous donors, or you, an establishment that

is a consignee of a collecting establishment, are not required to test donations of human blood or blood components from autologous donors for evidence of infection due to communicable disease agents listed in paragraph (a) of this section or by a serological test for syphilis under paragraph (i) of this section, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you allow any autologous donation to be used for allogeneic transfusion, you must assure that all autologous donations are tested under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you ship autologous donations to another establishment that allows autologous donations to be used for allogeneic transfusion, you must assure that all autologous donations shipped to that establishment are tested under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you ship autologous donations to another establishment that does not allow autologous donations to be used for allogeneic transfusion, you must assure that, at a minimum, the first donation in each 30-day period is tested under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each autologous donation must be labeled as required under Sec. 606.121 of this chapter and with the following label, as appropriate:
