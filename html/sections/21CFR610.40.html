The following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To identify evidence of infection with syphilis in donors of Source Plasma, you must test donors for evidence of such infection in accordance with Sec. 640.65(b) of this chapter, and not under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You are not required to test donations of Source Plasma for evidence of infection due to the relevant transfusion-transmitted infections described in Sec. 630.3(h)(1)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this chapter (HTLV, West Nile virus, and Chagas disease).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For each of the relevant transfusion-transmitted infections described in Sec. 630.3(h)(1)(iv) through (vii) of this chapter (HTLV, syphilis, West Nile virus, and Chagas disease):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If, based on evidence related to the risk of transmission of that relevant transfusion-transmitted infection, testing each donation is not necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of such infection by blood or a blood component, you may adopt an adequate and appropriate alternative testing procedure that has been found acceptable for this purpose by FDA.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If, based on evidence related to the risk of transmission of that relevant transfusion-transmitted infection, testing previously required for that infection is no longer necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of such infection by blood or a blood component, you may stop such testing in accordance with procedures found acceptable for this purpose by FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each of the relevant transfusion-transmitted infections described in Sec. 630.3(h)(1)(viii) through (x) of this chapter (CJD, vCJD, malaria) and Sec. 630.3(h)(2) of this chapter (other transfusion-transmitted infections):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must test for evidence of infection when the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A test(s) for the relevant transfusion-transmitted infection is licensed, approved or cleared by FDA for use as a donor screening test and is available for such use; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Testing for the relevant transfusion-transmitted infection is necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of the relevant transfusion-transmitted infection by blood, or blood component, or blood derivative product manufactured from the collected blood or blood component.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must perform this testing on each donation, unless one of the following exceptions applies:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Testing of each donation is not necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of such infection by blood, blood component, or blood derivative product manufactured from the collected blood or blood component.

It may include evidence related to the seasonality or geographic limitation of risk of transmission of such infection by

blood or blood component, or other information related to when and how a donation is at risk of transmitting a relevant transfusion-transmitted infection.

To perform testing for evidence of infection due to relevant transfusion-transmitted infections as required in paragraph (a) of this section, you must use screening tests that FDA has licensed, approved, or cleared for such use, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. You must perform one or more such tests as necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission of relevant transfusion-transmitted infections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to testing for dedicated donations, medical devices, and samples. * * *</p><p class="depth2">* * * * *</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Further testing.

If no such supplemental test is available, you must perform one or more licensed, approved, or cleared tests as adequate and appropriate to provide additional information concerning the reactive donor's infection status.
