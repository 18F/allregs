                                Sec. 800.302  Transactions that are not covered transactions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Transactions that are not covered transactions include, without limitation:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A stock split or pro rata stock dividend that does not involve a change in control.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, holds 10,000 shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, constituting ten percent of the stock of Corporation B. Corporation B pays a 2-for-1 stock dividend. As a result of this stock split, Corporation A holds 20,000 shares of Corporation B, still constituting ten percent of the stock of Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of additional shares is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A transaction that results in a foreign person holding ten percent or less of the outstanding voting interest in a U.S. business (regardless of the dollar value of the interest so acquired), but only if the transaction is solely for the purpose of passive investment. (See Sec. 800.223.)</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In an open market purchase solely for the purpose of passive investment, Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires seven percent of the voting securities of Corporation X, which is a U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of the securities is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires nine percent of the voting shares of Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation A also negotiates contractual rights that give it the power to control important matters of Corporation X. The acquisition by Corporation A of the voting shares of Corporation X is not solely for the purpose of passive investment and is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires five percent of the voting shares in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the securities, Corporation A obtains the right to appoint one out of eleven seats on Corporation B's Board of Directors. The acquisition by Corporation A of Corporation B's securities is not solely for the purpose of passive investment. Whether the transaction is a covered transaction would depend on whether Corporation A obtains control of Corporation B as a result of the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An acquisition of any part of an entity or of assets, if such part of an entity or assets do not constitute a U.S. business. (See Sec. 800.301(c).)</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires, from separate U.S. nationals: (a) products held in inventory, (b) land, and (c) machinery for export. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A has not acquired a U.S. business, and this acquisition is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation X, a U.S. business, produces armored personnel carriers in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign person, seeks to acquire the annual production of those carriers from Corporation X. under a long-term contract. Assuming no other relevant facts, this transaction is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation X, a U.S. business, has developed important technology in connection with the production of armored personnel carriers. Corporation A seeks to negotiate an agreement under which it would be licensed to manufacture using that technology. Assuming no other relevant facts, neither the proposed acquisition of technology pursuant to that license agreement, nor the actual acquisition, is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation A enters into a contractual arrangement to acquire the entire armored personnel carrier business operations of Corporation X, including production facilities,

customer lists, technology, and staff. This transaction is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation X suspended all activities of its armored personnel carrier business a year ago and currently is in bankruptcy proceedings. Existing equipment provided by Corporation X is being serviced by another company, which purchased the service contracts from Corporation X. The business's production facilities are idle but still in working condition, some of its key former employees have agreed to return if the business is resuscitated, and its technology and customer and vendor lists are still current. Corporation X's personnel carrier business constitutes a U.S. business, and its purchase by Corporation A is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An acquisition of securities by a person acting as a securities underwriter, in the ordinary course of business and in the process of underwriting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An acquisition pursuant to a condition in a contract of insurance relating to fidelity, surety, or casualty obligations if the contract was made by an insurer in the ordinary course of business.</p>
