The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the alternate items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following condition is met: the award amount of the base bid and evaluated options plus the alternate items does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of alternate items by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation.</p>
