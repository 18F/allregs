                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial approval of security program. Unless otherwise  authorized by the designated official, each airport operator required to  have a security program under this part must submit its initial proposed  security program to the designated official for approval at least 90  days before the date any aircraft operator or foreign air carrier  required to have a security program under part 1544 or part 1546 of this  chapter is expected to begin operations. Such requests will be processed  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the  proposed security program, will either approve the program or give the  airport operator written notice to modify the program to comply with the  applicable requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The airport operator may either submit a modified security  program to the designated official for approval, or petition the  Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of  receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be  filed with the designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for  reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the  petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator  for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within  30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to  withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to  modify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendment requested by an airport operator. Except as provided  in Sec.  1542.103(c), an airport operator may submit a request to the  designated official to amend its security program, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated  official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment  to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the  designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the  designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request  to amend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amendment to a security program may be approved if the  designated official determines that safety and the public interest will  allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security  required under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the airport operator  may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition  within 30   days of receipt, together with any pertinent information, to the  Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the  petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated  official to approve the amendment or affirming the denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an  amendment, the designated official may amend a security program as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated official sends to the airport operator a notice,  in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than  30 days within which the airport operator may submit written  information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After considering all relevant material, the designated official  notifies the airport operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the  notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than  30 days after the airport operator receives the notice of amendment,  unless the airport operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no  later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The  airport operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the  designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the  effective date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the  petition, together with any pertinent information to the Administrator  for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within  30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to  withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency amendments. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this  section, if the designated official finds that there is an emergency  requiring immediate action with respect to safety and security in air  transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section  contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an  amendment, effective without stay on the date the airport operator  receives the notice of it. In such a case, the designated official must  incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings  for the amendment to be adopted. The airport operator may file a  petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section;  however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency  amendment.</p>
