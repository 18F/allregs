If you submit a semiannual compliance report for an affected source as required by this subpart as part of the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all information required by the 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 semiannual monitoring report for the deviations that are reported in the semiannual compliance report, submission of the semiannual compliance report satisfies your obligation to report the same deviation information in the semiannual monitoring report. However, in such situations, the semiannual monitoring report must cross-reference the semiannual compliance report, and submission of a semiannual compliance report does not otherwise affect any obligation you may have to report deviations from permit requirements for an affected source to your permitting authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71.</p>
