                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire protection and  law enforcement employees of public agencies who, at their own option,  perform special duty work in fire protection, law enforcement or related  activities for a separate and independent employer (public or private)  during their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and  independent employer are not combined with the hours worked for the  primary public agency employer for purposes of overtime compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment provided (1)  The special detail work is performed solely at the employee's option,  and (2) the two employers are in fact separate and independent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and independent can  only be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The primary employer may facilitate the employment or affect the  conditions of employment of such employees. For example, a police  department may maintain a roster of officers who wish to perform such  work. The department may also select the officers for special details  from a list of those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and  retain a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require  that the separate and independent employer pay the fee for such services  directly to the department, and establish procedures for the officers to  receive their pay for the special details through the agency's payroll  system. Finally, the department may require that the officers observe  their normal standards of conduct during such details and take  disciplinary action against those who fail to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a State  law or local ordinance requires that such work be performed and that  only law enforcement or fire protection employees of a public agency in  the same jurisdiction perform the work. For example, a city ordinance  may require the presence of city police officers at a convention center  during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform such work at  their own option, the hours of work need not be combined with the hours  of work for their primary employer in computing overtime compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section with  respect to special details of public agency fire   protection and law enforcement employees under section 7(p)(1) are  exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment set forth in part 791  of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Where an employee is directed by the public agency to perform  work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not apply. Thus,  assignments of police officers outside of their normal work hours to  perform crowd control at a parade, where the assignments are not solely  at the option of the officers, would not qualify as special details  subject to this exception. This would be true even if the parade  organizers reimburse the public agency for providing such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from  prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its employees.</p><p class="depth2">Overtime Compensation Rules</p>
