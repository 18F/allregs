                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General qualifications for use of cylinders. Unless otherwise  stated, as used in this section, the term ``cylinder'' includes a UN  pressure receptacle. As used in this subpart, filled or charged means an  introduction or presence of a hazardous material in a cylinder. A  cylinder filled with a Class 2 hazardous material (gas) and offered for  transportation must meet the requirements in this section and  Secs. 173.301a through 173.305, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compressed gases must be in UN pressure receptacles built in  accordance with the UN standards or in metal cylinders and containers  built in accordance with the DOT and ICC specifications and part 178 of  this subchapter in effect at the time of manufacture, and requalified  and marked as prescribed in subpart C in part 180 of this subchapter, if  applicable. The DOT and ICC specifications authorized for use are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">Packagings ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Use of existing cylinders is authorized. New construction is not  authorized. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2P 2Q ICC-3\1\ 3A 3AA 3AL 3AX 3A480X 3AAX 3B 3BN 3E 3HT 3T 4AA480 4B 4B240ET 4BA 4BW 4D 4DA 4DS 4E 4L 8 8AL 39</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A cylinder must be filled in accordance with this part. Before  each filling of a cylinder, the person filling the cylinder must  visually inspect the outside of the cylinder. A cylinder that has a  crack or leak, is bulged, has a defective valve or a leaking or  defective pressure relief device, or bears evidence of physical abuse,  fire or heat damage, or detrimental rusting or corrosion, may not be  filled and offered for transportation. A cylinder may be repaired and  requalified only as prescribed in subpart C of part 180 of this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pressure relief devices must be tested for leaks before a filled  cylinder is shipped from the cylinder filling plant. It is expressly  forbidden to repair a leaking fusible plug device where the leak is  through the fusible metal or between the fusible metal and the opening  in the plug body, except by removal and replacement of the pressure  relief device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A cylinder that previously contained a Class 8 material must be  requalified in accordance with Sec. 180.205(e) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When a cylinder with a marked pressure limit is prescribed,  another cylinder made under the same specification but with a higher  marked pressure limit is authorized. For example, a cylinder marked  ``DOT-4B500'' may be used when ``DOT-4B300'' is specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No person may fill a cylinder overdue for periodic  requalification with a hazardous material and then offer it for  transportation. The prohibition against offering a cylinder for  transportation that is overdue for periodic requalification does not  apply to a cylinder filled prior to the requalification due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A cylinder with an authorized service life may not be offered  for transportation in commerce after its authorized service life has  expired. However, a cylinder in transportation or a cylinder filled  prior to the expiration of its authorized service life may be  transported for reprocessing or disposal of the cylinder's contents.  After emptying, the cylinder must be condemned in accordance with  Sec. 180.205 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The pressure of the hazardous material at 55 C (131 F) may not  exceed \5/4\ of the service pressure of the cylinder. Sufficient outage  must be provided so the cylinder will not be liquid full at 55 C (131  F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Specification 2P, 2Q, 3E, 3HT, spherical 4BA, 4D, 4DA, 4DS, and  39 cylinders must be packed in strong non-bulk outer packagings. The  outside of the combination packaging must be marked with an indication  that the inner packagings conform to the prescribed specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any person who installs a valve into an aluminum cylinder in  oxygen service must verify the valve and the cylinder have the same  thread type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cylinder markings. Required markings on a cylinder must be  legible and must meet the applicable requirements of subpart C of part  180 of this subchapter. Additional information may be marked on the  cylinder provided it does not affect the required markings prescribed in  the applicable cylinder specification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Toxic gases and mixtures. Cylinders containing toxic gases and  toxic gas mixtures meeting the criteria of Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A or  B must conform to the requirements of Sec. 173.40 and CGA S-1.1  (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1.1 is not required) (IBR; see Sec. 171.7  of this subchapter) and CGA S-7 (IBR; see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter). A DOT 39 cylinder, UN non-refillable cylinder, or a UN  composite cylinder certified to ISO-11119-3 may not be used for a toxic  gas or toxic gas mixture meeting the criteria for Division 2.3, Hazard  Zone A or B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gases capable of combining chemically. A filled cylinder may not  contain any gas or material capable of combining chemically with the  cylinder's contents or with the cylinder's material of construction, so  as to endanger the cylinder's serviceability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Ownership of cylinder. A cylinder filled with a hazardous  material may not be offered for transportation unless it was filled by  the owner of the cylinder or with the owner's consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Pressure relief device systems. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraphs (f)(5) and (6) of this section, and Sec. 171.23(a)(5) of this  subchapter, a cylinder filled with a gas and offered for transportation  must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices sized and   selected as to type, location, and quantity, and tested in accordance  with CGA S-1.1 (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1.1 is not required) and  CGA S-7. The pressure relief device must be capable of preventing  rupture of the normally filled cylinder when subjected to a fire test  conducted in accordance with CGA C-14 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter), or, in the case of an acetylene cylinder, CGA C-12 (IBR,  see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A pressure relief device, when installed, must be in  communication with the vapor space of a cylinder containing a Division  2.1 (flammable gas) material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a specification 3, 3A, 3AA, 3AL, 3AX, 3AXX, 3B, 3BN, or 3T  cylinder filled with gases in other than Division 2.2 (except oxygen and  oxidizing gases transported by aircraft, see Secs. 173.302(f) and  173.304(f)), beginning with the first requalification due after December  31, 2003, the burst pressure of a CG-1, CG-4, or CG-5 pressure relief  device must be at test pressure with a tolerance of plus zero to minus  10%. An additional 5% tolerance is allowed when a combined rupture disk  is placed inside a holder. This requirement does not apply if a CG-2,  CG-3, or CG-9 thermally activated relief device or a CG-7 reclosing  pressure valve is used on the cylinder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A pressure relief device is required on a DOT 39 cylinder  regardless of cylinder size or filled pressure. A DOT 39 cylinder used  for liquefied Division 2.1 materials must be equipped with a metal  pressure relief device. Fusible pressure relief devices are not  authorized on a DOT 39 cylinder containing a liquefied gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A pressure relief device is not required on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A cylinder 305 mm (12 inches) or less in length, exclusive of  neck, and 114 mm (4.5 inches) or less in outside diameter, except when  the cylinder is filled with a liquefied gas for which this part requires  a service pressure of 1800 psig or higher or a nonliquefied gas to a  pressure of 1800 psig or higher at 21 C (70 F);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A cylinder with a water capacity of less than 454 kg (1000 lbs)  filled with a nonliquefied gas to a pressure of 300 psig or less at 21  C (70 F), except for a DOT 39 cylinder or a cylinder used for  acetylene in solution; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A cylinder containing a Class 3 or a Class 8 material without  pressurization, unless otherwise specified for the hazardous material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A UN pressure receptacle transported in accordance with  paragraph (k) or (l) or this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A pressure relief device is prohibited on a cylinder filled with  a Division 2.3 or 6.1 material in Hazard Zone A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Manifolding cylinders in transportation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cylinder  manifolding is authorized only under conditions prescribed in this  paragraph (g). Manifolded cylinders must be supported and held together  as a unit by structurally adequate means. Except for Division 2.2  materials, each cylinder must be equipped with an individual shutoff  valve that must be tightly closed while in transit. Manifold branch  lines must be sufficiently flexible to prevent damage to the valves that  otherwise might result from the use of rigid branch lines. Each cylinder  must be individually equipped with a pressure relief device as required  in paragraph (f) of this section, except that pressure relief devices on  manifolded horizontal cylinders that are mounted on a motor vehicle or  framework may be selected as to type, location, and quantity according  to the lowest marked pressure limit of an individual cylinder in the  manifolded unit. The pressure relief devices selected for the manifolded  unit must have been tested in accordance with CGA S-1.1 and CGA S-7.  Pressure relief devices on manifolded horizontal cylinders filled with a  compressed gas must be arranged to discharge unobstructed to the open  air. In addition, for Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material, the  pressure relief devices (PRDs) must be arranged to discharge upward to  prevent any escaping gas from contacting personnel or any adjacent  cylinders. Valves and pressure relief devices on manifolded cylinders  filled with a compressed gas must be protected from damage by framing, a  cabinet or other method. Manifolding is authorized for cylinders  containing the following gases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonliquefied (permanent) compressed gases authorized by  Sec. 173.302.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liquefied compressed gases authorized by Sec. 173.304.
