The determinations shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be made by following the procedures in Sec. 61.164(c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3); or in Sec. 61.164(d)(5), whichever is applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take into account changes in production rates, types of glass produced, and other factors that would affect the uncontrolled arsenic emission rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of a source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the Administrator 30 days prior notice of any emission test required in Sec. 61.164 to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit to the Administrator a written report of the results of the emission test and associated calculations required in Sec. 61.164(d) or (e), as applicable, within 60 days after conducting the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Submit to the Administrator a written report of the arsenic emission estimates calculated under Sec. 61.164(c):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 45 days after the effective date of this subpart for a source that has an initial startup date preceding the effective date; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 45 days after startup for a source that has an initial startup date after the effective date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit to the Adminstrator a written report of the uncontrolled arsenic emission rates determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The emission rate for the preceding 12-month period (or preceding 6-month period for the first 6-month determination) exceeded the applicable limit in Sec. 61.162(a)(1) or (b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The emission rate for the forthcoming 12-month period will exceed the applicable limit in Sec. 61.162(a)(1) or (b)(1). In this case, the owner or operator shall also notify the Administrator of the anticipated date of the emission test to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limit in Sec. 61.162(a)(2) or (b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ensure that the reports required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section are postmarked by the tenth day following the end of the 6-month reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To obtain approval to bypass a control device, as provided in Sec. 61.162(c), an owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart may make written application to the Administrator.
