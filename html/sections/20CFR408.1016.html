                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As soon as we receive a request for a formal or informal conference, we will set the time, date and place for the conference. Formal and informal conferences are held only in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will send you a written notice about the conference (either by mailing it to your last known address or by personally serving you with it) at least 10 days before the conference. However, we may hold the conference sooner if we all agree. We will not send written notice of the time, date, and place of the conference if you waive your right to receive it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We will schedule the conference within 15 days after you request it, but, at our discretion or at your request, we will delay the conference if we think

the delay will ensure that the conference is conducted efficiently and properly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will hold the conference at one of our offices in the United States, by telephone or in person, whichever you prefer. However, if you are outside the United States, we will hold the conference by telephone only if you request that we do so and time and language differences permit. We will hold the conference in person elsewhere in the United States if you show circumstances that make this arrangement reasonably necessary.</p>
