                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act (CAA),  in Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Acceptable makeup water means surface water from a river, lake, or  stream; water meeting drinking water standards; storm water runoff and  production area clean up water except for water from the by-product  recovery plant area; process wastewater treated to meet effluent  limitations guidelines in 40 CFR part 420; water from any of these  sources that has been used only for non-contact cooling or in water  seals; or water from scrubbers used to control pushing emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Backup quench station means a quenching device that is used for less  than 5 percent of the quenches from any single coke oven battery in the  12-month period from July 1 to June 30.</p><p class="depth0">Baffles means an apparatus comprised of obstructions for checking or  deflecting the flow of gases. Baffles are installed in a quench tower to  remove droplets of water and particles from the rising vapors by  providing a point of impact. Baffles may be installed either inside or  on top of quench towers and are typically constructed of treated wood,  steel, or plastic.</p><p class="depth0">Battery stack means the stack that is the point of discharge to the  atmosphere of the combustion gases from a battery's underfiring system.</p><p class="depth0">Batterywide extended coking means increasing the average coking time  for all ovens in the coke oven battery by 25 percent or more over the  manufacturer's specified design rate.</p><p class="depth0">By-product coke oven battery means a group of ovens connected by  common walls, where coal undergoes destructive distillation under  positive pressure to produce coke and coke oven gas from which by- products are recovered.</p><p class="depth0">By-product recovery plant area means that area of the coke plant  where process units subject to subpart L in part 61 are located.</p><p class="depth0">Coke oven battery means a group of ovens connected by common walls,  where coal undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke. A coke  oven battery includes by-product and non-recovery processes.</p><p class="depth0">Coke plant means a facility that produces coke from coal in either a  by-product coke oven battery or a non-recovery coke oven battery.</p><p class="depth0">Cokeside shed means a structure used to capture pushing emissions  that encloses the cokeside of the battery and ventilates the emissions  to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Coking time means the time interval that starts when an oven is  charged with coal and ends when the oven is pushed.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to  this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this  subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation  (including operating limits) or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement  an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the  operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a  permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limitation or work practice standard  in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of  whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means any emission limit, opacity limit, or  operating limit.</p><p class="depth0">Four consecutive pushes means four pushes observed successively.</p><p class="depth0">Fugitive pushing emissions means emissions from pushing that are not  collected by a capture system.</p><p class="depth0">Horizontal flue means a type of coke oven heating system used on  Semet-Solvay batteries where the heating flues run horizontally from one  end of the oven to the other end, and the flues are not shared with  adjacent ovens.</p><p class="depth0">Hot water scrubber means a mobile scrubber used to control pushing  emissions through the creation of an induced draft formed by the  expansion of pressurized hot water through a nozzle.</p><p class="depth0">Increased coking time means increasing the charge-to-push time for  an individual oven.</p><p class="depth0">Non-recovery coke oven battery means a group of ovens connected by  common walls and operated as a unit, where coal undergoes destructive  distillation under negative pressure to produce coke, and which is  designed for the combustion of the coke oven gas from which by-products  are not recovered.</p><p class="depth0">Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal  undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.</p><p class="depth0">Pushing means the process of removing the coke from the oven.  Pushing begins with the first detectable movement of the coke mass and  ends when the quench car enters the quench tower.</p><p class="depth0">Quenching means the wet process of cooling (wet quenching) the hot  incandescent coke by direct contact with water that begins when the  quench car enters the quench tower and ends when the quench car exits  the quench tower.</p><p class="depth0">Quench tower means the structure in which hot incandescent coke in  the quench car is deluged or quenched with water.</p><p class="depth0">Remove from service means that an oven is not charged with coal and  is not used for coking. When removed from service, the oven may remain  at the operating temperature or it may be cooled down for repairs.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in Sec.  63.2.</p><p class="depth0">Short battery means a by-product coke oven battery with ovens less  than five meters in height.</p><p class="depth0">Soaking means that period in the coking cycle that starts when an  oven is dampered off the collecting main and vented to the atmosphere  through an open standpipe prior to pushing and ends when the coke begins  to be pushed from the oven.</p><p class="depth0">Soaking emissions means the discharge from an open standpipe during  soaking of visible emissions due to either incomplete coking or leakage  into the standpipe from the collecting main.</p><p class="depth0">Standpipe means an apparatus on the oven that provides a passage for  gases from an oven to the atmosphere when the oven is dampered off the  collecting main and the standpipe cap is opened. This includes mini- standpipes that are not connected to the collecting main.</p><p class="depth0">Tall battery means a by-product coke oven battery with ovens five  meters or more in height.</p><p class="depth0">Vertical flue means a type of coke oven heating system in which the  heating flues run vertically from the bottom to the top of the oven, and  flues are shared between adjacent ovens.</p><p class="depth0">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice,  or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated  pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
