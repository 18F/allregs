[Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Selection criteria. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agency evaluation. Section 42(m)(2)(A) requires that the housing credit dollar amount allocated to a project is not to exceed the amount the Agency determines is necessary for the financial feasibility of the project and its viability as a qualified low-income housing project throughout the credit period. In making this determination, the Agency must consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sources and uses of funds and the total financing planned for the project. The taxpayer must certify to the Agency the full extent of all federal, state, and local subsidies that apply (or which the taxpayer expects to apply) to the project. The taxpayer must also certify to the Agency all other sources of funds and all development costs for the project. The taxpayer's certification should be sufficiently detailed to enable the Agency to ascertain the nature of the costs that will make up the total financing package, including subsidies and the anticipated syndication or placement proceeds to be raised. Development cost information, whether or not includible in eligible basis under section 42(d), that should be provided to the Agency includes, but is not limited to, site acquisition costs, construction contingency, general contractor's overhead and profit, architect's and engineer's fees, permit and survey fees, insurance premiums, real estate taxes during construction, title and recording fees, construction period interest, financing fees, organizational costs, rent-up and marketing costs, accounting and auditing costs, working capital and operating deficit reserves, syndication and legal fees, and developer fees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any proceeds or receipts expected to be generated by reason of tax benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of the housing credit dollar amount used for project costs other than the costs of intermediaries. This requirement should not be applied so as to impede the development of projects in hard-to-develop areas under section 42(d)(5)(C); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The reasonableness of the developmental and operational costs of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Timing of Agency evaluation--(i) In general. The financial determinations and certifications required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must be made as of the following times--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The financial determinations and certifications required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must be made as of the following times--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The time of the application for the housing credit dollar amount;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The time of the allocation of the housing credit dollar amount; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The date the building is placed in service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time limit for placed-in-service evaluation. For purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section, the evaluation for when a building is placed in service must be made not later than the date the Agency issues the Form 8609, ``Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation Certification.'' The Agency must evaluate all sources and uses of funds under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section paid, incurred, or committed by the taxpayer for the project up until date the Agency issues the Form 8609.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for final determinations and certifications. For the Agency's evaluation under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section, the taxpayer must submit a schedule of project costs. Such schedule is to be prepared on the method of accounting used by the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes, and must detail the project's total costs as well as those costs that may qualify for inclusion in eligible basis under section 42(d). For projects with more than 10 units, the schedule of project costs must be accompanied by a Certified Public Accountant's audit report on the schedule (an Agency may require an audited schedule of project costs for projects with fewer than 11 units). The CPA's audit must be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditor's report must be unqualified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Bond-financed projects. A project qualifying under section 42(h)(4) is not entitled to any credit unless the governmental unit that issued the bonds (or on behalf of which the bonds were issued), or the Agency responsible for issuing the Form(s) 8609 to the project, makes determinations under rules similar to the rules in paragraphs (a) (3), (4), and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section is effective on January 1, 2001.
