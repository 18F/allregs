                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All birds, except ratites, that on ante mortem inspection do not plainly show, but are suspected of being affected with, any disease or condition that under Sec. Sec. 381.80 to 381.93 of this Part may cause condemnation in whole or in part on post mortem inspection, shall be segregated from the other poultry and held for separate slaughter, evisceration, and post mortem inspection. The inspector shall be notified when such segregated lots are presented for post mortem inspection, and inspection of such birds shall be conducted separately. Such procedure for the correlation of ante mortem and post mortem findings by the inspector, as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, shall be carried out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All ratites showing symptoms of disease will be segregated, individually tagged as ``U.S. Suspects'' by establishment personnel under FSIS supervision with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term ``U.S. Suspect,'' and held for further examination by an FSIS veterinarian.

Depending upon the findings of the veterinarian's examination, these birds will either be passed for regular slaughter, slaughtered as suspects, withheld from slaughter, or condemned on ante mortem. Those ratites affected with conditions that would be readily detected on post mortem inspection need not be individually tagged on ante mortem inspection with the ``U.S. Suspect'' tag provided that such ratites are segregated and otherwise handled as ``U.S. Suspects.'' All ratites identified as ``U.S. Condemned'' shall be tagged by establishment personnel, under FSIS supervision, with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term ``U.S. Condemned.''
