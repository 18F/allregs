                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. A plan sponsor may not cause a multiemployer plan to merge with one or more multiemployer plans or transfer assets or liabilities to or from another multiemployer plan unless the merger or transfer satisfies all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit is lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actuarial valuations of the plans that existed before the merger or transfer have been performed in accordance with Sec. 4231.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each plan that exists after the transaction, an enrolled actuary--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determines that the plan meets the applicable plan solvency requirement set forth in Sec. 4231.6; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise demonstrates that benefits under the plan are not reasonably expected to be subject to suspension under section 4245 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The plan sponsor notifies the PBGC of the merger or transfer in accordance with Sec. 4231.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance determination. If a plan sponsor requests a determination that a merger or transfer that may otherwise be prohibited by section 406(a) or (b)(2) of ERISA satisfies the requirements of section 4231 of ERISA, the plan sponsor must submit the information described in Sec. 4231.9 in addition to the information required by Sec. 4231.8. PBGC may request additional information if necessary to determine whether a merger or transfer complies with the requirements of section 4231 and this part. Plan sponsors are not required to request a compliance determination. Under section 4231(c) of ERISA, if the PBGC determines that the merger or transfer complies with section 4231 of ERISA and this part, the merger or transfer will not constitute a violation of the prohibited transaction provisions of section 406(a) and (b)(2) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certified change in bargaining representative. Transfers of assets and liabilities pursuant to a certified change in bargaining representative are governed by section 4235 of ERISA. Plan sponsors involved in such transfers are not required to comply with this part. However, under section 4235(f)(1) of ERISA, the plan sponsors of the plans involved in the transfer may agree to a transfer that complies with sections 4231 and 4234 of ERISA. Plan sponsors that elect to comply with sections 4231 and 4234 must comply with the rules in this part.</p>
