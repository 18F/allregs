                            <p class="depth0">All homestead and desert-land entrymen holding land under the  reclamation law must, in addition to paying the water-right charges,  reclaim the land as required by the reclamation law. Homestead entrymen  must reside upon, cultivate, and improve the lands embraced in their  entries for not less than the period required by the homestead laws.  Desert-land entrymen must comply with the provisions of the desert-land  laws as amended by the reclamation law. Failure to make payment of any  water-right charges due for more than 1 year, will render the entry  subject to cancellation and the money paid subject to forfeiture,  whether water-tight application has been made or not.</p>
