                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 1.706-1. If a taxpayer  ascertains that an item should have been included in gross income in a  prior taxable year, he should, if within the period of limitation, file  an amended return and pay any additional tax due. Similarly, if a  taxpayer ascertains that an item was improperly included in gross income  in a prior taxable year, he should, if within the period of limitation,  file claim for credit or refund of any overpayment of tax arising  therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rule in case of death. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer's taxable year  ends on the date of his death. See section 443(a)(2) and paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec. 1.443-1. In computing taxable income for such year, there  shall be included only amounts   properly includible under the method of accounting used by the taxpayer.  However, if the taxpayer used an accrual method of accounting, amounts  accrued only by reason of his death shall not be included in computing  taxable income for such year. If the taxpayer uses no regular accounting  method, only amounts actually or constructively received during such  year shall be included. (For rules relating to the inclusion of  partnership income in the return of a decedent partner, see subchapter  K, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the decedent owned an installment obligation the income from  which was taxable to him under section 453, no income is required to be  reported in the return of the decedent by reason of the transmission at  death of such obligation. See section 453(d)(3). For the treatment of  installment obligations acquired by the decedent's estate or by any  person by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the decedent, see section  691(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rule for employee tips. Tips reported by an employee to  his employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant  to section 6053(a) shall be included in gross income of the employee for  the taxable year in which the written statement is furnished the  employer. For provisions relating to the reporting of tips by an  employee to his employer, see section 6053 and Sec. 31.6053-1 of this  chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for ratable inclusion of original issue discount.  For ratable inclusion of original issue discount in respect of certain  corporate obligations issued after May 27, 1969, see section 1232(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for inclusion of qualified tax refund effected by  allocation. For rules relating to the inclusion in income of an amount  paid by a taxpayer in respect of his liability for a qualified State  individual income tax and allocated or reallocated in such a manner as  to apply it toward the taxpayer's liability for the Federal income tax,  see paragraph (f)(1) of Sec. 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on  Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Timing of income from notional principal contracts. For the  timing of income with respect to notional principal contracts, see  Sec. 1.446-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Timing of income from section 467 rental agreements. For the  timing of income with respect to section 467 rental agreements, see  section 467 and the regulations thereunder.
