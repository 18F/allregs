                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a for-profit participant currently grants access to its  records to the DCAA or other Federal Government auditors, your TIA must  include   for that participant the standard access-to-records requirements at 32  CFR 34.42(e). If the agreement is a fixed-support TIA, the language in  32 CFR 34.42(e) may be modified to provide access to records concerning  the recipient's technical performance, without requiring access to the  recipient's financial or other records. Note that any need to address  access to technical records in this way is in addition to, not in lieu  of, the need to address rights in data (see Sec. 37.845).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For other for-profit participants that do not currently give the  Federal Government direct access to their records and are not willing to  grant full access to records pertinent to the award, there is no set  requirement to include a provision in your TIA for Government access to  records. If the audit provision of an expenditure-based TIA gives an IPA  access to the recipient's financial records for audit purposes, the  Federal Government must have access to the IPA's reports and working  papers and you need not include a provision requiring direct Government  access to the recipient's financial records. For both fixed-support and  expenditure-based TIAs, you may wish to negotiate Government access to  recipient records concerning technical performance. Should you negotiate  a provision giving access only to specific Government officials (e.g.,  the agreements officer), rather than a provision giving Government  access generally, it is important to let participants know that the OIG,  DoD, has a statutory right of access to records and other materials to  which other DoD Component officials have access.</p>
