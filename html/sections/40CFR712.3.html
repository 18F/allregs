                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in section 3 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2602, apply for this  part. In addition, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Byproduct means any chemical substance or mixture produced  without a separate commercial intent during the manufacture, processing,  use, or disposal of another chemical substance or mixture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Import in bulk form means to import a chemical substance (other  than as part of a mixture or article) in any quantity, in cans, bottles,  drums, barrels, packages, tanks, bags, or other containers used for  purposes of transportation or containment, if the chemical substance has  an end use or commercial purpose separate from the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Importer means anyone who imports a chemical substance,  including a chemical substance as part of a mixture or article, into the  customs territory of the U.S. and includes the person liable for the  payment of any duties on the merchandise, or an authorized agent on his  behalf. Importer also includes, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consignee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The importer of record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The actual owner if an actual owner's declaration and  superseding bond has been filed in accordance with 19 CFR 141.20.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transferee, if the right to withdraw merchandise in a bonded  warehouse has been transferred in accordance with subpart C of 19 CFR  part 144. For the purposes of this definition, the customs territory of  the U.S. consists of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of  Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Impurity means a chemical substance unintentionally present with  another chemical substance or mixture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Intermediate means any chemical substance that is consumed, in  whole or in part, in chemical reactions used for the intentional  manufacture of other chemical substances or mixtures, or that is  intentionally present for the purpose of altering the rates of such  chemical reactions. (See also paragraph (j) of this section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Known to or reasonably ascertainable by means all information in  a person's possession or control, plus all information that a reasonable  person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or  know, or could obtain without unreasonable burden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Manufacture for commercial purposes means to import, produce, or  manufacture with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual  commercial advantage for the manufacturer and includes, among other  things, such ``manufacture'' of any   amount of a chemical substance or mixture:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For commercial distribution, including for test marketing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research  and development, or as an intermediate. Manufacture for commercial  purposes also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally  during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another  substance or mixture, including byproducts and coproducts that are  separated from that other substance or mixture, and impurities that  remain in that substance or mixture. Byproducts and impurities may not  in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for  the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of  the manufacture of a chemical produced for a commercial purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mixture means any combination of two or more chemical substances  if the combination does not occur in nature and is not, in whole or in  part, the result of a chemical reaction; except that mixture does  include (1) any combination which occurs, in whole or in part, as a  result of a chemical reaction if the combination could have been  manufactured for commercial purposes without a chemical reaction at the  time the chemical substances comprising the combination were combined,  and if all of the chemical substances comprising the combination are  included in the EPA, TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory after the  effective date of the premanufacture notification requirement under 40  CFR part 720, and (2) hydrates of a chemical substance or hydrated ions  formed by association of a chemical substance with water. The term  mixture includes alloys, inorganic glasses, ceramics, frits, and  cements, including Portland cement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Non-isolated intermediate means any intermediate that is not  intentionally removed from the equipment in which it is manufactured,  including the reaction vessel in which it is manufactured, equipment  which is ancillary to the reaction vessel, and any equipment through  which the substance passes during a continuous flow process, but not  including tanks or other vessels in which the substance is stored after  its manufacture. (See also paragraph (f) of this section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Owned or controlled by the parent company means the parent owns  or controls 50 percent or more of the other company's voting stock or  other equity rights, or has the power to control the management and  policies of the other company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Person means any natural person, firm, company, corporation,  joint venture, partnership, sole proprietorship, association, or any  other business entity, any State or political subdivision thereof, any  municipality, any interstate body, and any department, agency, or  instrumentality of the Federal government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Process for commercial purposes means the preparation of a  chemical substance or mixture, after its manufacture, for distribution  in commerce with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual  commercial advantage for the processor. Processing of any amount of a  chemical substance or mixture is included. If a chemical or mixture  containing impurities is processed for commercial purposes, then those  impurities are also processed for commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Site means a contiguous property unit.
