                            <p class="depth0">An amount recoverable may be recovered by setoff against any subsequent payments to which the individual from whom the amount is recoverable is entitled under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, the Railroad Retirement Act, or any other Act administered by the Board, or, in the case of that individual's death, from any payments due under those Acts to his or her estate, designee, next of kin, legal representative, or surviving spouse. In any case in which full recovery is not effected by setoff, the balance due may be recovered by one or more of the other methods described in this part. If the individual dies before

recovery is completed, such recovery shall be made from his estate or heirs.
