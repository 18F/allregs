Sec.  250.421 through 250.428.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Casing and cementing program requirements. Your casing and cementing programs must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Properly control formation pressures and fluids;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prevent communication between separate hydrocarbon-bearing strata;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Protect freshwater aquifers from contamination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Support unconsolidated sediments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and Sec.  250.423. Submit this certification with your APD (Form BSEE-0123).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and Sec.  250.423.

For the final casing string (or liner if it is your final string), you must install one mechanical barrier in addition to cement to prevent flow in the event of a failure in the cement. A dual float valve, by itself, is not considered a mechanical barrier. These barriers cannot be modified prior to or during completion or abandonment operations. The BSEE District Manager may approve alternative options under Sec.  250.141. You must submit documentation of this installation to BSEE in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cementing requirements. You must design and conduct your cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting

times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling out of the casing or before commencing completion operations.
