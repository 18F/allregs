                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and general requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability to Sec.  2.309(c). Section 2.309 motions for new or amended contentions filed  after the deadline in Sec. 2.309(b) are not subject to the requirements  of this section. For the purposes of this section the term ``all  motions'' includes any motion except Sec. 2.309 motions for new or  amended contentions filed after the deadline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Presentation and disposition. All motions must be addressed to  the Commission or other designated presiding officer. All motions must  be made no later than ten (10) days after the occurrence or circumstance  from which the motion arises. All written motions must be filed with the  Secretary and served on all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and content. Unless made orally on-the-record during a  hearing, or the presiding officer directs otherwise, or under the  provisions of subpart N of this part, a motion must be in writing, state  with particularity the grounds and the relief sought, be accompanied by  any affidavits or other evidence relied on, and, as appropriate, a  proposed form of order. A motion must be rejected if it does not include  a certification by the attorney or representative of the moving party  that the movant has made a sincere effort to contact other parties in  the proceeding and resolve the issue(s) raised in the motion, and that  the movant's efforts to resolve the issue(s) have been unsuccessful.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Answers to motions. Within ten (10) days after service of a  written motion,   or other period as determined by the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary,  or the presiding officer, a party may file an answer in support of or in  opposition to the motion, accompanied by affidavits or other evidence.  The moving party has no right to reply, except as permitted by the  Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, or the presiding officer. Permission  may be granted only in compelling circumstances, such as where the  moving party demonstrates that it could not reasonably have anticipated  the arguments to which it seeks leave to reply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accuracy in filing. All parties are obligated, in their filings  before the presiding officer and the Commission, to ensure that their  arguments and assertions are supported by appropriate and accurate  references to legal authority and factual basis, including, as  appropriate, citations to the record. Failure to do so may result in  appropriate sanctions, including striking a matter from the record or,  in extreme circumstances, dismissal of the party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Motions for reconsideration. Motions for reconsideration may not  be filed except upon leave of the presiding officer or the Commission,  upon a showing of compelling circumstances, such as the existence of a  clear and material error in a decision, which could not have reasonably  been anticipated, that renders the decision invalid. A motion must be  filed within ten (10) days of the action for which reconsideration is  requested. The motion and any responses to the motion are limited to ten  (10) pages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Referral and certifications to the Commission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, in the  judgment of the presiding officer, the presiding officer's decision  raises significant and novel legal or policy issues, or prompt decision  by the Commission is necessary to materially advance the orderly  disposition of the proceeding, then the presiding officer may promptly  refer the ruling to the Commission. This standard also applies to  matters certified to the Commission. The presiding officer shall notify  the parties of the referral or certification either by announcement on- the-record or by written notice if the hearing is not in session.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party may petition the presiding officer to certify a question  to the Commission for early review. The presiding officer shall apply  the criteria in Sec. 2.341(f)(1) in determining whether to grant the  petition for certification. No motion for reconsideration of the  presiding officer's ruling on a petition for certification will be  entertained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effect of filing a motion, petition, or certification of  question to the Commission. Unless otherwise ordered, neither the filing  of a motion, the filing of a petition for certification, nor the  certification of a question to the Commission stays the proceeding or  extends the time for the performance of any act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Motions to compel discovery. Parties may file answers to motions  to compel discovery in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.  The presiding officer, in his or her discretion, may order that the  answer be given orally during a telephone conference or other prehearing  conference, rather than in writing. If responses are given over the  telephone, the presiding officer shall issue a written order on the  motion summarizing the views presented by the parties. This does not  preclude the presiding officer from issuing a prior oral ruling on the  matter effective at the time of the ruling, if the terms of the ruling  are incorporated in the subsequent written order.
