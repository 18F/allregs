                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Borrowers are in default when they have received a  compliance violation notice, issued in accordance with Sec. 3560.354,  and have failed to correct the compliance violation identified in the  compliance violation notice within the time period specified in the  notice. Compliance violations include, but are not limited to,  violations of promissory note provisions, loan or grant agreement  provisions, regulatory, or other Agency requirements, including  requirements imposed on a borrower through a workout agreement developed  in accordance with Sec. 3560.453.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monetary defaults. A monetary default exists when any amount due  to the Agency or a third party (such as real estate taxes and insurance)  under a promissory note, loan or grant agreement, workout agreement, or  other agreement remains due more than 30 days after the due date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonmonetary defaults. A nonmonetary default exists when a  borrower fails to correct a compliance violation, other than a monetary  amount past due, within the time period specified in a compliance  violation notice issued in accordance with Sec. 3560.354. Nonmonetary  defaults include, but are not limited to, failure to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operate and manage a housing project in accordance with the  Agency approved management plan or Agency requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain the physical condition of a housing project in a  decent, safe, and sanitary manner and in accordance with Agency  requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keep general operating expense, reserve, and other financial  accounts related to a housing project at required funding levels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Occupy rental units with eligible tenants, unless granted an  exception by the Agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Charge correct rents or to correctly calculate net tenant  contributions, utility allowances, or rental assistance payments or to  properly administer the Agency rental assistance assigned to the housing  project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Submit required annual financial reports to the Agency within  time periods specified in Sec. 3560.308;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Submit management plans, leases, occupancy rules, and other  required materials to the Agency in accordance with Agency requirements;  and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Comply with applicable Federal laws including laws related to  civil rights, fair housing, disabilities, and environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Default notice. When borrowers are in default, the Agency will  notify borrowers, in writing, that they are in default. The default  notice will identify the compliance violation that led to the default,  will specify actions necessary to cure the default, and will establish a  date by which the default must be cured to preclude Agency initiation of  enforcement actions, liquidation, or other actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agency action. If a borrower fails to cure a default within the  time period specified in the default notice, the Agency may initiate the  enforcement actions described in Sec. 3560.461 or liquidation as  described in Sec. 3560.456. Also, Agency compliance violation notices  and related default notices may be referred to Federal, state, and local  agencies with jurisdictions related to the violations for handling, in  accordance with their requirements.</p>
