Upon receipt of notice that the court has made a finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination within the meaning of Sec.  42.208, the Office will institute administrative proceedings pursuant to Sec.  42.208, et seq.

Where the request to act does not result in timely resolution of the matter, OJARS will institute appropriate proceedings pursuant to this section.
