                            <p class="depth0">Control of employee exposure to harmful airborne contaminants shall be, insofar as feasible, by prevention of contamination, removal by exhaust ventilation, or by dilution with uncontaminated air. However, where accepted, engineering control measures have not been developed or when necessary by the nature of work involved (for example, while establishing controls or occasional entry into hazardous atmospheres to perform maintenance or investigation), employees may work for reasonable periods of time in concentrations of airborne contaminants exceeding permissible levels if they are protected by appropriate respiratory protective equipment. Whenever respiratory protective equipment is used a program for selection, maintenance, training, fitting, supervision, cleaning, and use shall meet the following miminum requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Respirators approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 which are applicable and suitable for the purpose intended shall be furnished and miners shall use the protective equipment in accordance with training and instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A respirator program consistent with the requirements of ANSI Z88.2-1969, published by the American National Standards Institute and entitled ``American National Standards Practices for Respiratory Protection ANSI Z88.2-1969,'' approved August 11, 1969, which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.
