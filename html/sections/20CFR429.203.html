                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A claim is allowable only if you were using the property incident to your service with SSA, with the knowledge and consent of a superior authority, and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partially by the negligent or improper action or inaction of you, your agent, the members of your family, or your private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity and the quality possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims that are otherwise allowable under this subpart will not be disallowed solely because you were not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim you make for damage to, or loss of, personal property that occurs incident to your service with SSA may be considered and allowed. For the purpose of this subpart, if you were performing your official duties at an alternate work location under an approved flexiplace agreement, the alternate work location will be considered an official duty station even if it is located in your principal residence. The alternate work location is not considered to be quarters. The following are examples of the principal types of claims that are allowable, but these examples are not exclusive and other types of claims are allowable, unless specifically excluded under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Property damage in quarters or other authorized places. Claims are allowable for damage to, or loss of, property arising from fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster, theft, or other unusual occurrence, while such property is located at:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Quarters within a state that were assigned to you or otherwise provided in kind by the United States; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any warehouse, office, working area, or other place (except quarters) authorized or apparently authorized for the reception or storage of property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation or travel losses. Claims are allowable for damage to, or loss of, property incident to transportation or storage of such property pursuant to order or in connection with travel under orders, including property in your custody or in the custody of a carrier, an agent or agency of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mobile homes. Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, mobile homes and their contents under the

provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Claims for structural damage to mobile homes, other than that caused by collision, and damage to contents of mobile homes resulting from such structural damage, must contain conclusive evidence that the damage was not caused by structural deficiency of the mobile home and that it was not overloaded. Claims for damage to, or loss of, tires mounted on mobile homes are not allowable, except in cases of collision, theft, or vandalism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Enemy action or public service. Claims are allowable for damage to, or loss of, property that directly result from:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enemy action or threat of enemy action, or combat, guerrilla, brigandage, or other belligerent activity, or unjust confiscation by a foreign power or its nationals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Action you take to quiet a civil disturbance or to alleviate a public disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Efforts you make to save human life or Government property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Property used for the benefit of the Government. Claims are allowable for damage to, or loss of, property when used for the benefit of the Government at the request of, or with the knowledge and consent of, superior authority, up to the amount not compensated by private insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Clothing and accessories. Claims are allowable for damage to, or loss of, clothing and accessories a person customarily wears and devices such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, or prosthetics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Expenses incident to repair. You may be reimbursed for the payment of any sales tax and other such fees incurred in connection with repairs to an item. The costs of obtaining estimates of repair (subject to the limitations set forth in Sec. 429.204(c)) are also allowable.</p>
