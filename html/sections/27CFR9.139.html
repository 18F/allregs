The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Santa Lucia Highlands.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the ``Santa Lucia Highlands'' viticultural area are 7 U.S.G.S. Quadrangle 7.5 minute series topographic maps. They are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chualar, Calif., 1947 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gonzales, Calif., 1955 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rana Creek, Calif., 1956 (photoinspected 1973)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Palo Escrito Peak, Calif., 1956 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Soledad, Calif., 1955 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sycamore Flat, Calif., 1956 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Paraiso Springs, Calif., 1956 (photorevised 1984)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundaries. The Santa Lucia Highlands viticultural area is located in Monterey County, California. The beginning point is found on the ``Chualar, California'' U.S.G.S. map, where Limekiln Creek crosses the 360 foot contour interval. This point also coincides with the western boundary of the Guadalupe Y Llanitos de los Correos Land Grant and the eastern boundary of section 28, T. 16S., R. 4E. The boundary is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the beginning point the boundary follows Limekiln Creek for approximately 1.25 miles northeast to the 100 foot elevation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Then following the 100 foot contour in a southeasterly direction for approximately 1 mile, where the boundary intersects the west bank of the Salinas River.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Then following the west bank of the Salinas River in a southeasterly direction on the Gonzales, California U.S.G.S. map for approximately 2.50 miles to the point on the Palo Escrito Peak, California U.S.G.S. map where the river channel crosses the 120 foot elevation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Then following the 120 foot elevation due south for approximately 2,200 feet where it climbs to the 160 foot elevation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Then following the 160 foot elevation in a southeasterly direction for approximately 6.50 miles, to the point where the 160 foot elevation crosses River Road.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Then following River Road in a southeasterly direction for approximately 1 mile to the junction of River, Fort Romie and Foothill Roads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Then following Foothill Road in a southeasterly direction for approximately 4 miles to the junction of Foothill and Paraiso Roads on the Soledad, California U.S.G.S. map.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Then following Paraiso Road in a southerly direction to the intersection with Clark Road on the Paraiso Springs, California U.S.G.S. map.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Then east-northeasterly along Clark Road for approximately 1,000 feet to its intersection with an unnamed light-duty road to the south.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Then in a straight south-southeasterly line for approximately 1.9
