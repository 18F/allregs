Accrued interest compensates us up front for interest that bidders will be paid but did not earn because it is attributable to a period of time prior to the issue date. (See appendix B, section I, paragraph C of this part for additional explanation and examples.)</p><p class="depth0">Adjusted value means, for an interest component stripped from an inflation-protected security, an amount derived by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the semiannual interest rate by the par amount, and then</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying this value by: 100 divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date (or dated date, when the dated date is different from the original issue date). (See appendix B, section IV of this part for an example of how to calculate the adjusted value.)</p><p class="depth0">Auction means a bidding process by which we sell marketable Treasury securities to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Autocharge agreement means an agreement in a format acceptable to Treasury between a submitter or clearing corporation and a depository institution that authorizes us to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Deliver awarded securities to the book-entry securities account of a designated depository institution in the commercial book-entry system, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Charge a funds account of a designated depository institution for the settlement amount of the securities.</p><p class="depth0">Bid means an offer to purchase a stated par amount of securities, either competitively or noncompetitively, in an auction.</p><p class="depth0">Bid-to-cover ratio means the total par amount of securities bid for in an auction divided by the total par amount of securities awarded.

We consider a controlled account to be a bidder when an investment adviser bids in the name of the controlled account (See Sec. 356.15.).</p><p class="depth0">Bidder Identification Number means a number we assign to each institutional submitter and to certain other bidders. We assign such numbers either to identify certain bidders or to grant separate bidder status to different parts of the same corporate or partnership structure.</p><p class="depth0">Book-entry security means a security that is issued or maintained as an accounting entry or electronic record in either the commercial book-entry system or in one of Treasury's two direct-hold systems--TreasuryDirect[supreg] or Legacy Treasury Direct[supreg].

Only depository institutions and dealers may submit bids for customers directly to us, or forward them to another depository institution or dealer.</p><p class="depth0">Dated date means the date from which interest accrues for notes and bonds.

(See appendix B for formulas and examples.)</p><p class="depth2">Discount margin means the margin over the index that equates the present values of the assumed cash flows on a floating rate note to the sum of the price of and accrued interest on the floating rate note.

(See appendix B.)</p><p class="depth2">Discount rate means a rate of return, on an annual basis, on bills held until they mature. The discount rate is expressed in percentage terms and based on a 360-day year. It is also referred to as the ``bank discount rate.''

(When the dated date is different from the original issue date, the denominator of the index ratio is the Reference CPI of the dated date rather than that of the original issue date.)</p><p class="depth2">Inflation-adjusted principal means, for an inflation-protected security, the value of the security derived by multiplying the par amount by the applicable index ratio as described in appendix B, section I, paragraph B.</p><p class="depth2">Interest rate means the annual percentage rate of interest paid on the par amount (or the inflation-adjusted principal) of a specific issue of notes or bonds. (See appendix B for methods and examples of interest calculations on notes and bonds.)</p><p class="depth2">Intermediary means a depository institution or dealer that forwards bids for customers to another depository institution or dealer. An intermediary does not submit bids directly to us.</p><p class="depth2">Issue date means the date specified in the auction announcement on which we issue a security as an obligation of the United States. Interest normally begins to accrue on a security's issue date.</p><p class="depth2">Legacy Treasury Direct means a non-Internet-based book-entry system maintained by Treasury for purchasing and holding marketable Treasury securities directly with Treasury. (See 31 CFR part 357.)</p><p class="depth2">Marketable security means a security that may be bought, sold and transferred in the secondary market.</p><p class="depth2">Maturity date means the date on which a security becomes due and payable, and ceases to earn interest.

For a multiple-price auction, a noncompetitive bid means a bid to purchase securities at the weighted average yield, discount rate, or discount margin of awards to competitive bidders.</p><p class="depth2">Offering amount means the par amount of securities we are offering to the public for purchase in an auction, as specified in the auction announcement.</p><p class="depth2">Par means a price of 100. (See appendix B.)</p><p class="depth2">Par amount means the stated value of a security at original issuance.</p><p class="depth2">Person means a natural person.</p><p class="depth2">Premium means the difference between par and the price of the security, when the price is greater than par.</p><p class="depth2">Premium amount means the premium divided by 100 and multiplied by the par amount.</p><p class="depth2">Price means the price of a security per 100 dollars of its stated value as calculated using the formulas in appendix B.</p><p class="depth2">Real yield means, for an inflation-protected security, the yield based on the payment stream in constant dollars.

The spread will be determined in the auction of a new floating rate note and is expressed in tenths of a basis point (i.e., to three decimals). Additionally, the spread will be equal to the high discount margin at the time a new floating rate note is auctioned.</p><p class="depth2">STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) means our program under which eligible securities are authorized to be separated into principal and interest components, and transferred separately. These components are maintained and transferred in the commercial book-entry system.</p><p class="depth2">Submitter means a person or entity submitting bids directly to us for its own account, for customer accounts, or both.
