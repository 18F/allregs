In addition, at a savings association's option, the appropriate Federal banking agency will evaluate

one or more categories of consumer lending, if the savings association has collected and maintained, as required in Sec. 195.42(c)(1), the data for each category that the savings association elects to have the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lending test evaluates a savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a savings association's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and community development lending.
