Such class determination file must contain the records of each class determination, notification, and correction, as applicable. For each class determination, the manufacturer must record once in each class determination file the information common to the class, and must identify by serial number all of the homes that the class comprises and that are subject to notification and correction, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturer records of notifications.

When a manufacturer is required to provide or provides correction under this subpart, the manufacturer must maintain a record of one of the following, as appropriate, for each manufactured home involved:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the correction is made, a certification by the manufacturer that the repair was made to conform to the federal construction and safety standards in effect at the time the home was manufactured and that each identified imminent safety hazard or serious defect has been corrected; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owner refuses to allow the manufacturer to repair the home, a certification by the manufacturer that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner has been informed of the problem that may exist in the home;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner has been provided with a description of any hazards, malfunctions, deterioration, or other consequences that may reasonably be expected to result from the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An attempt has been made to repair the problems, but the owner has refused the repair.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance of manufacturer's records. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for each manufactured home produced by a manufacturer, the manufacturer must maintain in a printed or electronic format all of the information required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and must consolidate the information in a readily accessible file or in a readily accessible combination of a printed file and an electronic file. For each home, the manufacturer also must include in such file a copy of the homes data plate; all information related to manufacture, handling, and assembly of the home; any checklist or similar documentation used by the manufacturer in the transport of the home; the name and address of the retailer; the original or a copy of each purchaser's registration record received by the manufacturer; all correspondence with the retailer and homeowner that is related to the home; any information received by the manufacturer regarding setup of the home; all work orders for servicing the home; and the information that the manufacturer is required to keep pursuant to Sec. 3282.211.
