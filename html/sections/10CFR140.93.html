of his injury or damage and the cause thereof.</p><p class="depth0">The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms by the claimant against the person indemnified.</p><p class="depth0">5. The waivers set forth in paragraph 4, of this article:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or occupational disease law: Provided, however, That with respect to an extraordinary nuclear occurrence occurring at the facility, a claimant who is employed at the facility in connection with the construction of a nuclear reactor with respect to which no operating license has been issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not be considered as employed in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The claimant is employed exclusively in connection with the construction of a nuclear reactor, including all related equipment and installations at the facility, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No operating license has been issued by the NRC with respect to the nuclear reactor, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The claimant is not employed in connection with the possession, storage, use or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this agreement and in contracts or other proof of financial protection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170(e), of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms of this agreement and the terms of contracts or other proof of financial protection.</p><p class="depth0">6. The obligations of the licensee under this agreement shall apply only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term of this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">7.

Neither this agreement nor any interest therein nor claim thereunder may be assigned or transferred without the approval of the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Article V</p><p class="depth0">The parties agree that they will enter into appropriate amendments of this agreement to the extent that such amendments are required pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or licenses, regulations or orders of the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Article VI</p><p class="depth0">The licensee agrees to pay to the Commission such fees as are established by the Commission pursuant to regulations or orders of the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII</p><p class="depth0">The term of this agreement shall commence as of the date and time specified in Item 6 of the attachment and shall terminate at the time of expiration of that license specified in Item 3 of the attachment, which is last to expire; provided that, except as may otherwise be provided in applicable regulations or orders of the Commission, the term of this agreement shall not terminate until all the radioactive material has been removed from the location and transportation of the radioactive material from the location has ended as defined in subparagraph 5(b), Article I. Termination of the term of this agreement shall not affect any obligation of the licensee or any obligation of the Commission under this agreement

with respect to any nuclear incident occurring during the term of this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII</p><p class="depth0">The following provisions are applicable to each licensee operating a facility designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(E)</em> of the Act) nor exceed $10,000,000 per incident within one calendar year. If the licensee fails to pay assessed deferred premiums, the Commission reserves the right to pay those premiums on behalf of the licensee and to recover the amount of such premiums from the licensee.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Commission shall require the immediate submission of financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an assessment of the restrospective premium by the insurance pools, that they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the Commission, as required.</p><p class="depth0">3. If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph 1, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in the amount paid in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such licensee. The lien shall arise at the time payment is made by the Commission and shall continue until the liability for the amount (or a judgment against the licensee arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable. The Commission will issue a certificate of release of any such lien if it finds that the liability for the amount has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 days. The Commission may take any further action as necessary if reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including, but not limited to, termination of the operating license or combined license.</p><p class="depth0">United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission</p><p class="depth0">Indemnity Agreement No. ------</p><p class="depth0">Attachment
