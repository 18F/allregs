                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the Consumer Product Safety Commission that all items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 (including garments and fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in such children's sleepwear) are subject to the Standard FF 5-74 (subpart A of this part) unless the manufacturing process has ended before May 1, 1975. The manufacturing process is deemed to end, for the purposes of the Standard, at the time the item is completely assembled, all functional materials have been affixed, and labeling of a permanent nature has been stamped, sewn, or otherwise permanently affixed to the item. Affixing of temporary price or promotional information or the packaging of items of sleepwear (including garments and fabrics or related material intended or promoted for use in such sleepwear) does not affect the date on which the manufacturing process is deemed to end.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 (including garments and fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in such children's sleepwear) which are in inventory or with the trade on the effective date of Standard FF 5-74 are exempt from the requirements of the Standard. For domestically-made items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 to be considered ``in inventory or with the trade'' on the effective date of the Standard, the manufacturing process must have ended prior to May 1, 1975. For foreign-made items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 to be considered ``in inventory or with the trade'' on the effective date of the Standard, the manufacturing process must have ended and the goods must have been entered into the United States before May 1, 1975.</p>
