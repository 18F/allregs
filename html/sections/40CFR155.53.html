                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will review data and information described in Sec.  155.50(a), (b), and (c) or submitted in response to a Data Call-In  notice that it believes should be considered in the pesticide's  registration review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assess changes since a pesticide's last review. The Agency will  assess any changes that may have occurred since the Agency's last  registration decision in order to determine the significance of such  changes and whether the pesticide still satisfies the FIFRA standard for  registration. The Agency will consider whether to conduct a new risk  assessment to take into account, among other things, any changes in  statutes or regulations, policy, risk assessment procedures or methods,  or data requirements. The Agency will consider whether any new data or  information on the pesticide, including any data or information  submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-In notice,  warrant conducting a new risk assessment or a new risk/benefit  assessment. The Agency will also consider whether any new data or  information regarding an individual pesticide product, including any  data or information submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a  Data Call-In notice, such as data or information about an inert  ingredient in the pesticide product or other information or data  relating to the composition, labeling or use of the pesticide product,  warrant additional review of a pesticide product's registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conduct new assessments as needed. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Active ingredient(s) in  the registration review case. If the Agency finds that a new assessment  of the pesticide is needed, it will determine whether it   can base the new assessment on available data or information, including  data or information submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a  Data Call-In notice. If sufficient data or information are available,  the Agency will conduct the new risk assessment or risk/benefit  assessment. If the Agency determines that additional data or information  are needed to conduct the review, the Agency will issue a Data Call-In  notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public participation during a pesticide's registration review.  The Agency will generally make available for public review and comment a  draft risk assessment for a pesticide if a new risk assessment has been  conducted. The Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register  announcing the availability of the draft risk assessment and provide a  comment period of at least 30 calendar days. The Agency will publish a  notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a revised  risk assessment, an explanation of any changes to the proposed document,  and its response to comments. If the revised risk assessment indicates  risks of concern, the Agency may, in the notice announcing the  availability of the revised risk assessment, provide a comment period of  at least 30 calendar days for the public to submit suggestions for  mitigating the risk identified in the revised risk assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency might not request comments on a draft risk assessment  in cases where the Agency's initial screening of a pesticide indicates  that it has low use/usage, affects few if any stakeholders or members of  the public, poses low risk, and/or requires little or no risk  mitigation. In such cases, the Agency will make a draft risk assessment  available for public review and comment when it issues a proposed  decision on the registration review case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency finds that it is not necessary to conduct a new  risk assessment, it will issue a proposed decision on the registration  review case as described in Sec. 155.58.</p>
