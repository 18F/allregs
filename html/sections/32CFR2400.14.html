                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Derivative classification is (1) the determination that  information is in substance the same as information currently  classified, and (2) the application of the same classification markings.  Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified  information, or who only apply classification markings derived from  source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not  possess original classification authority. If a person who applies  derivative classification markings believes that the paraphrasing,  restating, or summarizing of classified information has changed the  level of or removed the basis for classification, that person must  consult an appropriate official of the originating agency or office of  origin who has the authority to declassify, downgrade or upgrade the  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Observe and respect original classification decisions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carry forward to any newly created documents any assigned  authorized markings. The declassification date or event that provides  the longest period of classification shall be used for documents  classified on the basis of multiple sources.</p>
