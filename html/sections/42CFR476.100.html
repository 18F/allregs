                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of norms. As specified in its contract, a QIO must use national, or where appropriate, regional norms in conducting review to achieve QIO contract objectives. However, with regard to determining the number of procedures selected for preadmission review, a QIO must use national admission norms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of criteria. In assessing the need for and appropriateness of an inpatient health care facility stay, a QIO must apply criteria to determine--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The necessity for facility admission and continued stay (in cases of day outliers in hospitals under prospective payment);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The necessity for surgery and other invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appropriateness of providing services at a particular health care facility or at a particular level of care. The QIO must determine whether the beneficiary requires the level of care received or whether a lower and less costly level of care would be equally effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establishment of criteria and standards. For the conduct of review a QIO must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establish written criteria based upon typical patterns of practice in the QIO area, or use national criteria where appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish written criteria and standards to be used in conducting quality review studies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Variant criteria and standards. A QIO may establish specific criteria and standards to be applied to certain locations and facilities in the QIO area if the QIO determines that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The patterns of practice in those locations and facilities are substantially different from patterns in the remainder of the QIO area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a reasonable basis for the difference which makes the variation appropriate.</p>
