                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When conducting training and testing activities, as identified in Sec.  218.70, the mitigation measures contained in the LOA issued under Sec. Sec.  216.106 and 218.77 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Lookouts--The following are protective measures concerning the use of Lookouts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lookouts positioned on ships will be dedicated solely to diligent observation of the air and surface of the water.

Their observation objectives will include, but are not limited to, detecting the presence of biological resources and recreational or fishing boats, observing mitigation zones, and monitoring for vessel and personnel safety concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lookouts positioned in aircraft or on small boats will, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with aircraft and boat safety and training and testing requirements, comply with the observation objectives described above in Sec.  218.74 (a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lookout measures for non-impulsive sound:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With the exception of ships less than 65 ft (20 m) in length and ships which are minimally manned, ships using low-frequency or hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar sources associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea will have two Lookouts at the forward position of the ship. For the purposes of this rule, low-frequency active sonar does not include surveillance towed array sensor system low-frequency active sonar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> While using low-frequency or hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar sources associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea, vessels less than 65 ft (20 m) in length and ships which are minimally manned will have one Lookout at the forward position of the vessel due to space and manning restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Ships conducting active sonar activities while moored or at anchor (including pierside testing or maintenance) will maintain one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Surface ships or aircraft conducting high-frequency or non-hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar activities associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lookout measures for explosives and impulsive sound:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Aircraft conducting IEER sonobuoy activities will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Explosive sonobuoys with 0.6 to 2.5 lb net explosive weight will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Surface vessels conducting anti-swimmer grenade activities will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> During general mine countermeasure and neutralization activities using up to a 500-lb net explosive weight detonation (bin E10 and below), vessels greater than 200 ft will have two Lookouts, while vessels less than 200 ft or aircraft will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> General mine countermeasure and neutralization activities using a 501 to 650-lb net explosive weight detonation (bin E11), will have two Lookouts. One Lookout will be positioned in an aircraft and one in a support vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> During activities involving diver-placed mines under positive control, activities using up to a 500 lb net explosive weight (bin E10) detonation will have a total of two Lookouts (one Lookout positioned on two small boats, or one small boat in combination with either a helicopter or shore-based. The shore-based observer would be stationed at an elevated on-shore position and would only be used during activities conducted in very shallow waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> When mine neutralization activities using diver-placed charges with up to a 29-lb net explosive weight detonation (bin E7) are conducted with a time-delay firing device, four Lookouts will be used. Two Lookouts will be positioned in each of two small rigid hull inflatable boats or on one boat. In addition, when aircraft are used, the pilot or member of the aircrew will serve as an additional Lookout. The divers placing the charges on mines will report all marine mammal sightings to their dive support vessel or Range Safety Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Surface vessels or aircraft conducting small- and medium-caliber gunnery exercises against a surface target will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Surface vessels conducting large-caliber gunnery exercises against a surface target will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Aircraft conducting missile exercises (including rockets) against surface targets will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Aircraft conducting bombing exercises will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> During explosive torpedo testing, one Lookout will be used and positioned in an aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> During sinking exercises, two Lookouts will be used. One Lookout will be positioned in an aircraft and one on a surface vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Each surface vessel supporting at-sea explosive testing will have at least one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> During pile driving, one Lookout will be used and positioned on the platform that will maximize the potential for marine mammal sightings (e.g., the shore, an elevated causeway, or on a small boat).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> Surface vessels conducting explosive and non-explosive large-caliber gunnery exercises will have one Lookout. This may be the same Lookout used during large-caliber gunnery exercises with a surface target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Lookout measures for physical strike and disturbance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> While underway, surface ships will have at least one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> During activities using towed in-water devices, when towed from a manned platform, one Lookout will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Activities involving non-explosive practice munitions (e.g., small-, medium-, and large-caliber gunnery exercises) using a surface target will have one Lookout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> During activities involving non-explosive bombing exercises, one Lookout positioned in an aircraft will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> During activities involving non-explosive missile exercises (including rockets) using a surface target, one Lookout will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mitigation Zones--The following are protective measures concerning the implementation of mitigation zones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mitigation zones will be measured as the radius from a source and represent a distance to be monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Visual detections of marine mammals within a mitigation zone will be communicated immediately to a watch station for information dissemination and appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Mitigation zones for non-impulsive sound: \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The mitigation zone would be 200 yd (183 m) for low-frequency non-hull mounted sources in bins LF4 and LF5.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When marine mammals are visually detected, the Navy shall ensure that low-frequency and hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal operating levels, for sources that can be powered down, if any detected marine mammals are within 1,000 yd (914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Navy shall ensure that low-frequency and hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar transmissions are limited to at least 10 dB below the equipment's normal operating level, for sources that can be powered down, if any detected marine mammals are within 500 yd (457 m) of the sonar dome.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Navy shall ensure that low-frequency sonar and hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar transmissions are ceased, for sources that can be turned off during the activity, if any visually detected marine mammals are within 200 yd (183 m) of the sonar dome.

Response Plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Navy shall abide by the letter of the ``Stranding Response Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the HSTT Study Area,'' to include the following measures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--defined in Sec.  218.71 (b)(1)) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) in the HSTT Study Area, the Navy shall implement the procedures described below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Navy shall implement a shutdown (as defined Sec.  218.71 (b)(2)) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the HSTT Study Area Stranding Communication Protocol that a USE involving live animals has been identified and that at least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and the Navy will maintain a dialogue, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the potential need to implement shutdown procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Navy finds an injured or dead animal floating at sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s), including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead, location, time of first discovery, observed behavior (if alive), and photo or video (if available). Based on the information provided, NFMS will determine if, and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the event, following a USE, that qualified individuals are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals are not willing to leave, or animals are seen repeatedly heading for the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of mid-frequency active sonar training activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nautical miles from the distressed animal(s), is likely contributing to the animals' refusal to return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy will further coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to

improve the probability that the animals will return to open water and implement those measures as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the HSTT Study Area Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using mid-frequency active sonar, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training activities occurring within 80 nautical miles (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE event. Information not initially available regarding the 80-nautical miles (148-km), 72-hour period prior to the event will be provided as soon as it becomes available. The Navy will provide NMFS investigative teams with additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
