                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tipped employees shall be paid from the regular nonappropriated  fund (NAF) schedule applicable to the employee's duty station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A tip offset may be authorized for employees classified as  Waiter/Waitress. For purposes of this section, a tipped employee is one  who is engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and  regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips, and a tip offset is  the amount of money by which an employer, in meeting legal minimum wage  standards, may reduce a tipped employee's cash wage in consideration of  the receipt of tips.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A tip offset may be established, abolished, or adjusted by NAF  instrumentalities on an annual basis and at such additional times as new  or revised minimum wage statutes require. The amount of any tip offset  may vary within a single instrumentality based on location, type of  service, or time of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If tipped employees are represented by a labor organization  holding exclusive recognition, the employing NAF instrumentality shall  negotiate with such organization to arrive at a determination as to  whether, when, and how much tip offset shall be applied. Changes in tip  offset practices may be made more frequently than annually as a result  of collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tip offset practices shall be governed by the Fair Labor  Standards Act, as amended, or the applicable statutes of the State,  possession or territory   where an employee works, whichever provides the greater benefit to the  employee. In locations where tip offset is prohibited by law, the  requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply.  [55 FR 46146, Nov. 1, 1990]</p>
