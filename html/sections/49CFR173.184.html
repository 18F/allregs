                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A fusee is a device designed to burn at a controlled rate and to produce visual effects for signaling purposes. The composition of the fusee must be such that the fusee will not ignite spontaneously or undergo marked decomposition when subjected to a temperature of 75 C (167 F) for 48 consecutive hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fusees (highway and railway) must be packaged in steel (1A2), aluminum (1B2) or other metal (1N2) drums, steel (3A2) or aluminum (3B2) jerricans, steel (4A), aluminum (4B) or other metal (4N) boxes, wooden (4C1, 4C2), plywood (4D) or reconstituted wood (4F) boxes or in fiberboard boxes (4G), plywood (1D) or fiber (1G) drums. If the fusees are equipped with spikes packagings must have reinforced ends to prevent penetration of spikes through the outer packagings; packages must be capable of passing drop test requirements (Sec. 178.603 of this subchapter), including at least one drop with spike in a downward position, and other requirements of part 178 of this subchapter, at the Packing Group II performance level.
