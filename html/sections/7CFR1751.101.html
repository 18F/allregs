                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of RUS that every State have a Modernization  Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's  telecommunications network.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A proposed Modernization Plan must be submitted to RUS for  approval. RUS will approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it  conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, RUS's  approval of a Modernization Plan cannot be rescinded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with RUS's authority  to issue such other telecommunications standards, specifications,  requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to  time by RUS including, without limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part  1755.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to RUS  Borrowers' wireline service areas. If a Modernization Plan is developed  by the PUC, RUS encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization  Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all providers of  telecommunications services in the State. A PUC's decision not to  include non-RUS Borrowers will not prejudice RUS approval of that PUC's  Modernization Plan. The PUC may also, at its option, extend coverage of  the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all providers of  telecommunications services in the State. In addition, while the  requirements and goals contained in Sec. 1751.106 apply only to wireline  services, the PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of  Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in the  State as it deems appropriate. Borrower-developed Modernization Plans  apply only to Borrowers.</p>
