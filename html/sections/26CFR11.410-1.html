                                Sec. 11.410-1  Election by church to have participation, vesting,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> (relating to joint  and survivor annuities, mergers and consolidations, assignment or  alienation of benefits, time of benefit commencement, certain social  security increases, and withdrawals of employee contributions,  respectively).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election is irrevocable. An election under this section with  respect to any church plan shall be binding with respect to such plan  and, once made, shall be irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for making election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time of election. An election  under this section may be made for plan years for which the provisions  of section 410(d) of the Code apply to the church plan. By reason of  section 1017(b) of the Act section 410(d) does not apply to a plan in  existence on January 1, 1974, for plan years beginning before December  31, 1975. Section 1017(d) of the Act permits a plan administrator to  elect to have certain provisions of the Code (including section 410(d))  apply to a plan before the otherwise applicable effective dates of such  provisions. See Sec. 420.0-1 of the regulations in this chapter  (Temporary Regulations on Procedure and Administration under the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974). Therefore, an election  under section 410(d) of the Code may be made for a plan year beginning  before December 31, 1975, only if an election has been made under  section 1017(d) of the Act with respect to that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> By whom election is to be made. The election provided by this  section may be made only by the plan administrator of the church plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making election. The plan administrator may elect to  have the provisions of the Code described in paragraph (a) of this  section apply to the church plan as if it were not a church plan by  attaching the statement described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph  to either (i) the annual return required under section 6058(a) (or an  amended return) with respect to the plan which is filed for the first  plan year for which the election is effective or (ii) a written request  for a determination letter relating to the qualification of the plan  under section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a) of the Code and, if trusteed,  the exempt status under section 501(a) of the Code of a trust  constituting a part of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Conditional election. If an election is made with a written  request for a determination letter, the election may be conditioned upon  issuance of a favorable determination letter and will become irrevocable  upon issuance of such letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Statement. The statement described in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph shall indicate (i) that the election is made under section  410(d) of the Code and (ii) the first plan year for which it is  effective.  (Sec. 410(d), Internal Revenue Code, 1954 (88 Stat. 901; 26 U.S.C.  410(d)))  [T.D. 7363, 40 FR 27217, June 27, 1975]    Sec. 11.410(b)-1  Minimum coverage requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)-(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discrimination. The determination as to whether a plan  discriminates in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or  highly compensated, is   made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing  a reasonable difference between the percentage of such employees  benefited by the plan to all employees benefited by the plan and the  percentage of all such employees of the employer to all employees of the  employer. A showing that a specified percentage of employees covered by  a plan are not officers, shareholders, or highly compensated, without a  showing that the difference (if any) between such percentage and the  percentage of all employees who are not officers, shareholders, or  highly compensated is reasonable, is not sufficient to establish that  the plan does not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers,  shareholders, or highly compensated.  (Sec. 410, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (88 Stat. 898; 26 U.S.C. 410))  [T.D. 7380, 40 FR 45816, Oct. 3, 1975, as amended by T.D. 7508, 42 FR  47197, Sept. 20, 1977]    Sec. 11.412(c)-7  Election to treat certain retroactive plan amendments as made on the first day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Under section 412(c)(8), a plan administrator may  elect to have any amendment which is adopted after the close of the plan  year to which it applies deemed to have been made on the first day of  such plan year if the amendment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is adopted no later than 2 and one-half months after the close  of such plan year (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, no later  than 2 years after the close of such plan year),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant  determined as of the beginning of such plan year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant  determined as of the time of adoption of the amendment, or, if it does  so reduce such accrued benefit, it is shown that the plan administrator  filed a notice with the Secretary of Labor notifying him of the  amendment, and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary of Labor approved the amendment, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary of Labor failed to disapprove the amendment  within 90 days after the date on which the notice was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The election under  section 412(c)(8) shall be made by the plan administrator by a statement  of election described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, attached to  the annual return relating to minimum funding standards required to be  filed under section 6058 with respect to the plan year to which the  election relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event that an amendment to which paragraph (a) of this  section applies is adopted after the filing of the annual return  required under section 6058, the plan administrator may make the  election under section 412(c)(8) by attaching a statement of election,  described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to a copy of such annual  return, and filing such copy no later than the time allowed for the  filing of such returns under section 6058. (In the case of multiemployer  plans, such copy may be filed within a 24 month period beginning with  the date prescribed for the filing of such returns.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The statement of election filed by or on behalf of the plan  administrator shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State the date of the close of the first plan year to which the  amendment applies and the date on which the amendment was adopted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contain a statement that the amendment does not reduce the  accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the beginning of the  plan year preceding the plan year in which the amendment is adopted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contain either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the amendment does not reduce the accrued  benefit of any participant determined as of the time of adoption of such  amendment, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A copy of the notice filed with the Secretary of Labor under  section 412(c)(8) and a statement that either the Secretary of Labor has  approved the amendment or he has failed to act within 90 days after  notification of the amendment.

So long as this election is in  effect, the value of any such evidence of indebtedness shall, for  purposes of section 412, be determined on such an amortized basis rather  than on a method taking into account fair market value as described in  section 412(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manner of making election. The election to value evidences of  indebtedness in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be  made by a statement to that effect attached to and filed as a part of  the annual return of the plan required under section 6058 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)(A)</em> and must continue  to be so valued until the indebtedness is no longer in default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consent to revoke required--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.
