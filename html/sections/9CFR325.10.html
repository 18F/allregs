                                Sec. 325.10  Handling of products which may have become adulterated
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When it is claimed that any inspected and passed product, marked  with an inspection legend, has become adulterated or misbranded after it  has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be  transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral  permission is obtained from the area supervisor of the area in which  that offical establishment is located. The transportation of the product  may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported  or to another official establishment designated by the person desiring  to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for  the purpose of officially determining if the product has become  adulterated or misbranded and making the appropriate disposition. The  area supervisor shall make a record of the authorization and such other  information which will effectively identify the shipment and shall  provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment  receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the  authorization record upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment,  a careful inspection shall be made of the product by a Program  inspector, and if it is found that the article is not adulterated, the  same may be received into the establishment; but if the article is found  to be adulterated, it shall at once be stamped ``U.S. inspected and  condemned'' and disposed of in accordance with part 314 of this  subchapter, and if it is found to be misbranded, it shall be handled in  accordance with Sec. 318.2(d) of this subchapter: Provided, That when a  product is found to be affected with one of the correctable conditions  specified in Sec. 318.2(d) of this subchapter, in respect to which  rehandling is permitted, it may be transported from the official  establishment to another official establishment for such rehandling as  is necessary to assure that the product is not adulterated or misbranded  when finally released. The transportation of such a product from an  official establishment shall be done in a manner prescribed in each  specific case by the Administrator.
