                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State  which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other  requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal  energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall  prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he/she  determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence  that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or  local energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term  ``unusual and compelling State or local energy interests'' means  interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude from  those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated  within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the costs,  benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting from the  State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when  measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of  alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including  reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in  efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The  Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested  persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the  State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing,  distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national  basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary  shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to which the  State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of  manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State  regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or  dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered equipment in  the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden  to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered equipment type (or  class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation  would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected  availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of  the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or  projected sales volume of the covered equipment type (or class) in the  State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is  likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State  commercial and industrial equipment efficiency requirements and the  cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not  prescribe such a rule if he/she finds that such a rule will result in  the unavailability in the State of any covered equipment (or class) of  performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes,  capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those  generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding.  The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not  affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for  other classes (or types).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(vi)</em> of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence  relating to such petition shall be available for public review except  for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with  the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth  in 10 CFR part 1004.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such  standard is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for  which a rule exempting a standard is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the  petitioner; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Such other information as the Secretary may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency  conditions exist within State. Upon petition by a State which has  prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a  type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy  conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a rule,  effective upon publication in the Federal Register, that such regulation  not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section the State has established  that: an energy emergency condition exists within the State that  imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the  inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate  quantities of gas or electric energy to its residents at less than  prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the  importation of energy or the use of interconnection agreements; and the  State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section, and shall be available for public  review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in  accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information  Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the energy emergency condition which exists  within the State, including causes and impacts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of emergency response actions taken by the State  and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be  alleviated substantially by importation of energy or the use of  interconnection agreements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate  substantially such emergency condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard.  Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted  from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation  standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment,  when the Federal energy conservation standard for such equipment  subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the  exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition  in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section,  except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that  the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result  of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw  such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should  be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(vii)</em> of this section, and shall be available for public review,  except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in  accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information  Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule  withdrawing an exemption is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an  exemption is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for  which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the  petitioner; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Such other information as the Secretary may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p>
