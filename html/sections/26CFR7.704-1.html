A partner is entitled to  deduct the share of partnership loss to the extent of the adjusted basis  of the partner's interest in the partnership. As amended, section 704(d)  provides, in general, that the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in  the partnership for the purpose of deducting partnership losses shall  not include any portion of a partnership liability for which the partner  has no personal liability. This restriction, however, does not apply to  any activity to the extent that section 465 of the Code applies nor to  any partnership whose principal activity is investing in real property,  other than mineral property. Section 465 does not apply to corporations  other than a subchapter S corporation or a personal holding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The restrictions in the amendment to section 704(d) will not  apply to any corporate partner with respect to liabilities incurred in  an activity described in section 465(c)(1). In all other respects the  restrictions in the amendment will apply to all corporate partners  unless the partnership's principal activity is investment in real  property, other than mineral property.
