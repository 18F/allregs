Moreover, the holder agrees to allow the occupancy and use by the United States, its lessees, or other right-of-way holders, of any part of the right-of-way grant not actually occupied or necessarily incident to its use for any necessary operations involved in the management, administration, or the enjoyment of such other granted rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the right-of-way holder discovers any archaeological resource while conducting operations within the right-of-way, the right-of-way holder shall immediately halt operations within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the Regional Director.
