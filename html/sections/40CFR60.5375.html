                            <p class="depth0">If you are the owner or operator of a gas well affected facility,  you must comply with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (4) of this section. You must maintain a log  as specified in paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em>  and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the initial flowback stage, route the flowback into one  or more well completion vessels or storage vessels and commence  operation of a separator unless it is technically infeasible for a  separator to function. Any gas present in the initial flowback stage is  not subject to control under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During the separation flowback stage, route all recovered  liquids from the separator to one or more well completion vessels or  storage vessels, re-inject the liquids into the well or another well or  route the recovered liquids to a collection system. Route the recovered  gas from the separator into a gas flow line or collection system, re- inject the recovered gas into the well or another well, use the  recovered gas as an on-site fuel source, or use the recovered gas for  another useful purpose that a purchased fuel or raw material would  serve. If it is infeasible to route the recovered gas as required above,  follow the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If, at any  time during the separation flowback stage, it is not technically  feasible for a separator to function, you must comply with (a)(1)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All salable quality recovered gas must be routed to the gas flow  line as soon as practicable. In cases where salable quality gas cannot  be directed to the flow line, you must follow the requirements in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must capture and direct recovered gas to a completion  combustion device, except in conditions that may result in a fire hazard  or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a completion combustion  device may negatively impact tundra, permafrost or waterways. Completion  combustion devices must be equipped with a reliable continuous ignition  source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You have a general duty to safely maximize resource recovery and  minimize releases to the atmosphere during flowback and subsequent  recovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must maintain a log for each well completion operation at  each gas well affected facility. The log must be completed on a daily  basis for the duration of the well completion operation and must contain  the records specified in Sec. 60.5420(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must demonstrate initial compliance with the standards that  apply to gas well affected facilities as required by Sec. 60.5410.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards  that apply to gas well affected facilities as required by Sec. 60.5415.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must perform the required notification, recordkeeping and  reporting as required by Sec. 60.5420.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section, you must comply with the  requirements of paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing at a  wildcat or delineation well.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing at a  non-wildcat low pressure gas well or non-delineation low pressure gas  well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Route the flowback into one or more well completion vessels and  commence operation of a separator unless   it is technically infeasible for a separator to function. Any gas  present in the flowback before the separator can function is not subject  to control under this section. You must capture and direct recovered gas  to a completion combustion device, except in conditions that may result  in a fire hazard or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a  completion combustion device may negatively impact tundra, permafrost or  waterways. Completion combustion devices must be equipped with a  reliable continuous ignition source. You must also comply with  paragraphs (a)(4) and (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must maintain records specified in Sec. 60.5420(c)(1)(iii)  for wildcat, delineation and low pressure gas wells.
