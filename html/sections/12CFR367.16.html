                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard of proof:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An exclusion must be based on a finding that the cause(s) for exclusion is established by a preponderance of the evidence in the administrative record of the case; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A suspension must be based on a finding that the cause(s) for suspension is established by adequate evidence in the administrative record of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The administrative record consists of the portion of any information, reports, documents or other evidence identified and relied upon in the Notice of Possible Cause to Exclude, the Notice of Suspension and/or supplemental notices, if any, together with any material portions of the contractor's response. When additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, the Ethics Counselor shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the contractor and any other information in the administrative record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In actions based upon a conviction, judgment, a final enforcement action by a federal financial institution regulatory agency, or in which all facts and circumstances material to the exclusion action have been finally adjudicated in another forum, the Ethics Counselor may exclude a contractor without regard to the procedures set out in Sec. Sec. 367.13 and 367.14. Any such decisions will be subject to the review and reconsideration provisions of Sec. 367.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of decisions. Contractors shall be given prompt notice of the Ethics Counselor's decision in the manner described in Sec. 367.13(c). If the Ethics Counselor suspends a contractor or imposes a period of exclusion, the decision shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set forth the cause(s) for suspension and/or exclusion included in the notice that were found by a preponderance of the evidence with reference to the administrative record support for that finding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set forth the effect of the exclusion action and the effective dates of that action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refer the contractor to its procedural rights of review and reconsideration under Sec. 367.20; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inform the contractor that a copy of the exclusion decision shall be placed in the FDIC Public Reading Room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the FDIC Ethics Counselor decides that a period of exclusion is not warranted, the Notice of Possible Cause to Exclude may be withdrawn or the proceeding may be otherwise terminated. A decision to terminate an exclusion proceeding may include the imposition of appropriate conditions on the contractor in their future dealings with the FDIC.</p>
