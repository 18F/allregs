                            <p class="depth0">Proceedings for the issuance of rules or regulations, including  proceedings for exemption of products or classes of products from  statutory requirements, may be commenced by the Commission upon its own  initiative or pursuant to petition filed with the Secretary by any  interested person or group stating reasonable grounds therefor. Anyone  whose petition is not deemed by the Commission sufficient to warrant the  holding of a rulemaking proceeding will be promptly notified of that  determination and given an opportunity to submit additional data.  Procedures for the amendment or repeal of a rule or regulation are the  same as for the issuance thereof.  [32 FR 8444, June 13, 1967. Redesignated at 40 FR 15232, Apr. 4, 1975]</p>
