                            <p class="depth0">Stations licensed under this part shall transmit identification in  accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification procedure. Except as provided for in paragraphs  (d) and (e) of this section, each station or system shall be identified  by the transmission of the assigned call sign during each transmission  or exchange of transmissions, or once each 15 minutes (30 minutes in the  Public Safety Pool) during periods of continuous operation. The call  sign shall be transmitted by voice in the English language or by  International Morse Code in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section. If the station is employing either analog or digital voice  scrambling, or non-voice emission, transmission of the required  identification shall be in the unscrambled mode using A3E, F3E or G3E  emission, or International Morse, with all encoding disabled.  Permissible alternative identification procedures are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A mobile relay stations call sign may be used to identify the  associated control and mobile stations, except in the Public Safety Pool  where the stations operate on frequencies below 450 MHz. Alternatively,  a base station (including a mobile relay station) which is controlled by  radio may be identified by the transmission of the call sign of the  station at which communications originate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One or more fixed relay stations may be identified by the  transmission of the call signs of the stations at which the  communications originate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a mobile station transmits on a different frequency than  its associated base station, the assigned call sign of either the mobile  station or the base station may be transmitted. Further, a single mobile  unit in the licensee's authorized geographic area of operation may  transmit station identification on behalf of any other operating mobile  units in the fleet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of an identifier other than the assigned call sign. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  the Public Safety Pool, mobile units licensed to a governmental entity  and which operate on frequencies above 30 MHz may use an identifier  which contains, at a minimum, the name of the licensee if the licensee  maintains at the station a list of the special identifiers to be used by  the mobile units.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the Industrial/Business Pool, licensees may request the  Commission's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to approve the use of  special mobile unit identifiers in lieu of the assigned call sign. Such  requests, however, will not be granted where it appears that harmful  interference to international operations may be caused by stations below  50 MHz, or by stations operating in areas within 80 km (50 miles) of an  international boundary, or where it appears that the proposed method of  identification will not adequately distinguish the mobile units of the  applicant from the mobile units of other licensees in the area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the Industrial/Business Pool, railroad licensees (as  defined in Sec. 90.7) may identify stations by the name of the railroad  and the train number, caboose number, engine number, or the name of the  fixed wayside station. If none of these forms is practicable, any  similar name or number may be designated by the railroad concerned for  use by its employees in the identification of fixed points or mobile  units, provided that a list of such identifiers is maintained by the  railroad. An abbreviated name or the initials of the railroad may be  used where such are in general usage. In those areas where it is shown  that no difficulty would be encountered in identifying the transmission  of a particular station (as, for example, where stations of one licensee  are located in a yard isolated from other radio installations), approval  may be given to a request from the licensee for permission to omit the  station identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use of identifiers in addition to assigned call signs. Nothing  in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the transmission of  station or unit identifiers which may be necessary or desirable for  system operation, provided that they are transmitted in addition to the  assigned station call sign or other permissible form of identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of automatic Morse code identification equipment.  Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station  identification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The signal output of the automatic identification equipment  shall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any  other manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted  to produce 40 percent 10 percent of the maximum  permissible modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be  performed when all other modulating signals are absent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20  and 25 words per minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification  signal shall be 1200 800 Hz. A licensee may be  required to change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the  operations of another co-channel licensee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Should activation of automatic Morse code identification  equipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee,  the Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay  automatic station identification until such co-channel communications  are completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special provisions for identification in the Radiolocation  Service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stations in the Radiolocation Service are not required to  identify except upon specific instruction from the Commission or as  required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Stations in the Radiolocation Service operating on frequencies  above 3400 kHz that employ spread spectrum techniques shall transmit a  two letter manufacturer's designator, authorized by the Commission on  the station authorization, at the beginning and ending of each  transmission and once every 15 minutes during periods of continuing  operation. The designator shall be transmitted in International Morse  Code at a speed not exceeding 25 words per minute, and the spread  spectrum mode of operation shall be maintained while the designator is  being transmitted. The identifying signal shall be clearly receivable in  the demodulated audio of a narrow-band FM receiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General exemptions. A station need not transmit identification  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a mobile station operating on the transmitting frequency  of the associated base station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is a mobile station in the Public Safety Pool using F1E or  G1E emission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is transmitting for telemetering purposes or for the  activation of devices which are employed solely as a means of attracting  attention, or for remote control purposes, or which is retransmitting by  self-actuating means, a radio signal received from another radio station  or stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is any type of radiopositioning or radar station authorized  in a service other than the Radiolocation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is used solely for automatic vehicle monitoring or location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> It is a paging station authorized in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> It is a mobile station employing non-voice emissions and the  associated base station identifies on behalf of the mobile unit(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> It is a base or mobile station in the 220-222 MHz band  authorized to operate on a nationwide basis in accordance with subpart T  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> It is a wireless microphone station operating in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 90.265(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> It is a Roadside Unit in a DSRCS system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that  are classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Station identification will not be required for 929-930 MHz  nationwide paging licensees or MTA or EA-based SMR licensees. All other  CMRS stations will be required to comply with the station identification  requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMRS stations subject to a station identification requirement  will be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned  facilities that are operated as part of a single system. The call sign  must be transmitted each hour within five minutes of the hour, or upon  completion of the first transmission after the hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMRS stations granted exclusive channels may transmit their call  signs digitally. A licensee that identifies its call sign in this manner  must provide the Commission, upon request, information sufficient to  decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that  are not classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stations subject to a station identification requirement will be  permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned facilities that  are operated as part of a single system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Stations licensed on an exclusive basis in the bands between 150  and 512 MHz that normally employ digital signals for the transmission of  data, text, control codes, or digitized voice may be identified by  digital transmission of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its  call sign in this manner must provide the Commission, upon request,  information sufficient to decode the digital transmission and ascertain  the call sign transmitted.
