Nothing in this part limits the authority of the  Board under any provision of law or regulation to impose on any company  additional enhanced prudential standards, including, but not limited to,  additional risk-based or leverage capital or liquidity requirements,  leverage limits, limits on exposures to single counterparties, risk- management requirements, stress tests, or other requirements or  restrictions the Board deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this  part or Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act, or to take supervisory or  enforcement action, including action to address unsafe and unsound  practices or conditions, or violations of law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modifications or extensions of this part. The Board may extend  or accelerate any compliance date of this part if the Board determines  that such extension or acceleration is appropriate. In determining  whether an extension or acceleration is appropriate, the Board will  consider the effect of the modification on financial stability, the  period of time for which the modification would be necessary to  facilitate compliance with this part, and the actions the company is  taking to come into compliance with this part.</p>
