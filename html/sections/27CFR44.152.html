                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Remission of the tax liability on tobacco products, and cigarette  papers and tubes may be extended to the export warehouse proprietor  liable for the tax where such articles in bond are lost (otherwise than  by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the  possession or ownership of such proprietor. Where articles are so lost  or destroyed the proprietor shall report promptly such fact, and the  circumstances, to the appropriate TTB officer. If the proprietor wishes  to be relieved of the tax liability, the proprietor must prepare and  file a claim on TTB Form 5620.8. The nature, date, place, and extent of  the loss or destruction must be stated in such claim. The claim must be  accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to establish to the  satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the claim is valid.  When the appropriate TTB officer has acted on the claim, such officer  will return a copy of TTB Form 5620.8 to the proprietor as notice of  such action. The proprietor must keep the copy of TTB Form 5620.8 for 3  years following the close of the calendar year in which the claim is  filed.  (72 Stat. 1419, as amended; 26 U.S.C. 5705)  [T.D. 6961, 33 FR 9492, June 28, 1968. Redesignated at 40 FR 16835, Apr.  15, 1975, and amended by T.D. ATF-232, 51 FR 28088, Aug. 5, 1986; T.D.
