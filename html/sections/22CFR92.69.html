                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Execution of letters rogatory by foreign officials. Procedures for payment of foreign costs will be by arrangement with the foreign authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Execution of commissions by foreign officials or other persons abroad. Procedure for the payment of foreign costs will be as arranged, by the tribunal requiring the evidence, with its commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Witness fees and allowances when depositions are taken pursuant to commission from a Federal court. A witness attending in any court of the United States, or before a United States commissioner, or before any person authorized to take his deposition pursuant to any rule or order of a cut of the United States, shall receive $4 for each day's attendance and for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the same, and 8 cents per mile for going from and returning to his place of residence. Witnesses who are not salaried employees of the Government and who are not in custody and who attend at points so far removed from their respective residence as to prohibit return thereto from day to day shall be entitled to an additional allowance of $8 per day for expenses of subsistence, including the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance (28 U.S.C. 1821, Supp. IV). Witnesses giving depositions before consular officers pursuant to a commission issued by the Federal Court are entitled to these fees and allowances, and the officer shall make payment thereof in the same manner as payment is made of other expenses involved in the execution of the commission, charging the advance deposit provided by the party at whose request the depositions are taken (see Sec. 92.68). In any case to which the Government of the United States, or an officer or agency thereof, is a party, the United States marshal for the district will pay all fees of witnesses on the certificate of the United States Attorney or Assistant United States Attorney, and in the proceedings before a United States Commissioner, on the certificate of such commissioner (28 U.S.C. 1825).</p>
