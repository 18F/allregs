This approach may be useful, for example, if a commercial firm that is a participant will not accept an agreement with all of the post-award requirements of an expenditure-based award. Before using a fixed-support arrangement for that firm's portion of the project, the agreement must meet the criteria in Sec. 603.305.</p><p class="depth0">Accounting, Payments, and Recovery of Funds</p>
