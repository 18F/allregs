                            <p class="depth0">The Superintendent, with the consent of the Osage Minerals Council, may grant commercial and noncommercial easements for wells off the leased premises to be used for purposes associated with oil and gas production; provided that the Superintendent notifies or attempts to notify both the surface owner and lessee in writing of their opportunity to meet with and submit information for consideration before a final decision is made. Rents payable to the Osage mineral estate for such easements must be in an amount agreed to by Grantee and the Osage Minerals Council, subject to the approval of the Superintendent. The Grantee is responsible for all damages resulting from the use of such wells and settlement for any damages must be made as provided in Sec. 226.41.</p>
