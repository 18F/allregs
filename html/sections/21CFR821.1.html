                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this part implement section 519(e) of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), which provides that the  Food and Drug Administration may require a manufacturer to adopt a  method of tracking a class II or class III device, if the device meets  one of the following three criteria and FDA issues an order to the  manufacturer: the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to  have serious adverse health consequences; or the device is intended to  be implanted in the human body for more than 1 year; or the device is a  life-sustaining or life-supporting device used outside a device user  facility. A device that meets one of these criteria and is the subject  of an FDA order must comply with this part and is referred to, in this  part, as a ``tracked device.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These regulations are intended to ensure that tracked devices  can be traced from the device manufacturing facility to the person for  whom the device is indicated, that is, the patient. Effective tracking  of devices from the manufacturing facility, through the distributor  network (including distributors, retailers, rental firms and other  commercial enterprises, device user facilities, and licensed  practitioners) and, ultimately, to the patient is necessary for the  effectiveness of remedies prescribed by the act, such as patient  notification (section 518(a) of the act) or device recall (section  518(e) of the act). Although these regulations do not preclude a  manufacturer from involving outside organizations in that manufacturer's  device tracking effort, the legal responsibility for complying with this  part rests with manufacturers who are subject to tracking orders, and  that responsibility cannot be altered, modified, or in any way abrogated  by contracts or other agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The primary burden for ensuring that the tracking system works  rests upon the manufacturer. A manufacturer or any other person,  including a distributor, final distributor, or multiple distributor, who  distributes a device subject to tracking, who fails to comply with any  applicable requirement of section 519(e) of the act or of this part, or  any person who causes such failure, misbrands the device within the  meaning of section 502(t)(2) of the act and commits a prohibited act  within the meaning of sections 301(e) and 301(q)(1)(B) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person subject to this part who permanently discontinues  doing business is required to notify FDA at the time the person notifies  any government agency, court, or supplier, and provide FDA with a  complete set of its tracking records and information. However, if a  person ceases distribution of a tracked device but continues to do other  business, that person continues to be responsible for compliance with  this part unless another person, affirmatively and in writing, assumes  responsibility for continuing the tracking of devices previously  distributed under this part. Further, if a person subject to this part  goes out of business completely, but other persons acquire the right to  manufacture or distribute tracked devices, those other persons are  deemed to be responsible for continuing the tracking responsibility of  the previous person under this part.
