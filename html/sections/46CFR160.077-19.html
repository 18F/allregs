                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section contains approval tests and  examinations for recreational hybrid PFD's. Each test and examination  must be conducted or supervised by an independent laboratory. The tests  must be done using PFD's that have been constructed in accordance with  the plans and specifications in the application for approval. In each  test only one PFD is required to be tested unless otherwise specified or  needed to complete the tests in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All data relating to buoyancy and pressure must be taken at, or  corrected to, standard atmospheric pressure of 760 mm (29.92 inches) of  mercury and temperature of 20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tests in paragraph (b) of this section must be completed  before doing the tests in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In each test that specifies inflation by an automatic inflation  mechanism and either or both of the other mechanisms, the automatic  inflation mechanism must be tested first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Some tests in this section require PFD's to be tested while  being worn. The number and characteristics of the test subjects must be  as prescribed in section 11 of UL 1517.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tests. Each PFD design must be tested according to the  procedures in the following tests and meet the requirements in those  tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Donning and Operability, UL 1517, section 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Jump Test, UL 1517, section 13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flotation Stability and Inflation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Uninflated Flotation Stability, UL 1517, section 14.</p><p class="depth4">Note: If the freeboard of a test subject is close to zero, caution  must be taken to prevent the subject from inhaling water. The subject  may use lightweight breathing aids to avoid inhaling water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inflation, UL 1517, section 14.3 through 14.5 using a PFD with  each automatic inflation mechanism disabled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inflated flotation stability, UL 1517, section 15, for Type II  and Type III performance except comparisons are to be made to the  appropriate size and Type reference vest as defined in Sec. 160.077- 2(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Water Emergence, UL 1517, section 16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Operation Force Test, UL 1517, section 17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Buoyancy, buoyancy distribution, and inflation medium retention  test, UL 1517, sections 18 and 19, except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recreational hybrid inflatables must provide minimum buoyancy as  specified in Table 160.077-15(b)(13):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The buoyancy and volume displacement of kapok buoyant inserts  must be tested in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Sec.  160.047-4(c)(4) and Sec. 160.047-5(e)(1) in lieu of the procedures in  UL 1517, section 18 and 19.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Inflation Chamber Tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Over-pressure Test, UL 1517, section 28.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air Retention Test, UL 1517, section 29.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Temperature Cycling Tests, UL 1517, section 23.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Solvent Exposure Test, UL 1517, section 24.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Environmental Tests, UL 1517, section 31.1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Humidity Exposure, UL 1517, section 31.4.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rain Exposure, UL 1517, section 31.2 and 31.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Abrasion/Compression Test, UL 1517, section 26.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Water Entrapment Test, UL 1517, section 20.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Tensile Tests, UL 1517, section 22.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Strength of Attachment of Inflation Mechanism, UL 1517, section  30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Flame Exposure Test, UL 1517, section 25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Impact Test, UL 1517, section 21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Seam Strength Test, UL 1517, section 33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Puncture Test, UL 1517, section 27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Visual Examination.

The tests in this  paragraph must be run if the tests in paragraph (b) of this section are  successfully completed. The results of these tests will be used to check  the quality of incoming PFD components and the production process. Test  samples must come from one of more PFD's that were each used in all of  the tests in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(16), and (b)(18) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grab breaking strength. Grab breaking strength of chamber  materials must be determined according to Method No. 5100 of Federal  Test Method Standard 191, or ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 160.077-5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tear strength.

The seam strength of the seams in each inflation  chamber of at least one PFD must be determined according to ASTM D 751  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.077-5), except that 25 mm by  200 mm (1 in. by 8 in.) samples may be used where insufficient length of  straight seam is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commandant may prescribe additional tests, if necessary, to  approve unique or novel designs.
