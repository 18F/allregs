The transportation costs of travel by outreach  workers, social workers, medical professionals, or other service  providers are eligible, provided that this travel takes place during the  provision of services eligible under this section. The costs of  transporting unsheltered people to emergency shelters or other service  facilities are also eligible. These costs include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost of a program participant's travel on public  transportation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If service workers use their own vehicles, mileage allowance  for service workers to visit program participants;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The cost of purchasing or leasing a vehicle for the recipient  or subrecipient in which staff transports program participants and/or  staff serving program participants, and the cost of gas, insurance,  taxes and maintenance for the vehicle; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The travel costs of recipient or subrecipient staff to  accompany or assist program participants to use public transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Services for special populations.

Reasonable steps may include steps to increase revenue  generation, steps to maximize cost savings, or steps to reduce  expenditures in areas other than services for homeless people.</p>
