                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The General Guidelines in this part and the Technical  Guidelines incorporated by reference in Sec. 300.13 govern the  Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program authorized by section  1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13385(b)). The  purpose of the guidelines is to establish the procedures and  requirements for filing voluntary reports, and to encourage  corporations, government agencies, non-profit organizations, households  and other private and public entities to submit annual reports of their  greenhouse gas emissions, emission reductions, and sequestration  activities that are complete, reliable and consistent. Over time, it is  anticipated that these reports will provide a reliable record of the  contributions reporting entities have made toward reducing their  greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting under the program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each reporting entity, whether  or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of  this section, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> File an entity statement that meets the appropriate requirements  in Sec. 300.5(d) through (f) of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use appropriate emission inventory and emission reduction  calculation methods specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 300.13), and calculate and report the weighted  average quality rating of any emission inventories it reports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Comply with the record keeping requirements in Sec. 300.9 of  this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Comply with the certification requirements in Sec. 300.10 of  this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register  emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, may report  offset reductions achieved by other entities outside their boundaries as  long as such reductions are reported separately and calculated in  accordance with methods specified in the Technical Guidelines. The  third-party entity that achieved these reductions must agree to their  being reported as offset reductions, and must also meet all of the  requirements of reporting that would apply if the third-party entity  reported directly under the 1605(b) program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An entity that intends to register emissions and emission  reductions must meet the additional requirements referenced in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An entity that does not intend to register emissions and  emission reductions may choose to report its emissions and/or emission  reductions on an entity-wide basis or for selected elements of the  entity, selected gases or selected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An entity that does not intend to register emissions may report  emission inventories for any year back to 1990 and may report emission  reductions for any year back to 1991, relative to a base period of one  to four years, ending no earlier than 1990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Registration requirements. Entities that seek to register  reductions must meet the additional requirements in this paragraph;  although these requirements differ depending on whether the entity is a  large or small emitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for registration, a reduction must have been  achieved after 2002, unless the entity has committed under the Climate  Leaders or   Climate VISION programs to reduce its entity-wide emissions relative to  a base period that ends earlier 2002, but no earlier than 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A large emitter must submit an entity-wide emission inventory  that meets or exceeds the minimum quality requirements specified in  Sec. 300.6(b) and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 300.13). Registered reductions of a large emitter must be  based on an entity-wide assessment of net emission reductions,  determined in accordance with Sec. 300.8 and the Technical Guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A small emitter must also submit an emission inventory that  meets minimum quality requirements specified in Sec. 300.6(b) and the  Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13) and  base its registered reductions on an assessment of annual changes in net  emissions. A small emitter, however, may restrict its inventory and  assessment to a single type of activity, such as forest management,  building operations or agricultural tillage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reporting entities may, under certain conditions, register  reductions achieved by other entities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reporting entities that have met the requirements for  registering their own reductions may also register offset reductions  achieved by other entities if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> They have an agreement with the third-party entities to do so  and these third-party entities have met all of the requirements for  registration; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> They were the result of qualified demand management or other  programs and are calculated in accordance with the action-specific  method identified in Sec. 300.8(h)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Small emitters that serve as an aggregator may register offset  reductions achieved by non-reporting entities without reporting on their  own emissions, as long as they have an agreement with the third-party  entities to do so and these third-party entities have met all of the  requirements for registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Forms. Annual reports of greenhouse gas emissions, emission  reductions, and sequestration must be made on forms or software made  available by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of  Energy (EIA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Status of reports under previous guidelines. EIA continues to  maintain in its Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases database all  reports received pursuant to DOE's October 1994 guidelines. Those  guidelines are available from EIA at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ guidelns.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Periodic review and updating of General and Technical  Guidelines. DOE intends periodically to review the General Guidelines  and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  300.13) to determine whether any changes are warranted; DOE anticipates  these reviews will occur approximately once every three years. These  reviews will consider any new developments in climate science or policy,  the participation rates of large and small emitters in the 1605(b)  program, the general quality of the data submitted by different  participants, and any changes to other emissions reporting protocols.  Possible changes may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The addition of greenhouse gases that have been demonstrated to  have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to  the atmosphere in significant quantities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Changes to the minimum, quantity-weighted quality rating for  emission inventories;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Updates to emission inventory methods, emission factors and  other provisions that are contained in industry protocols or standards.  The review may also consider updates to any government-developed and  consensus-based emission factors for which automatic updating is not  provided in the Technical Guidelines;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modifications to the benchmarks or emission conversion factors  used to calculate avoided and indirect emissions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Changes in the minimum requirements for registered emission  reductions.</p>
