                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Release of classified information in any form (e.g., documents,  through interviews, audio/visual) to the news media is prohibited. The  disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals may be  cause for prosecution and/or disciplinary action against the NASA  employee involved. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding  classified information does not release a NASA employee from  responsibility for preventing any unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1,  Chapter 5, Section 5.23 for internal NASA guidance on management of  classified information. For further guidance that applies to all  agencies, see Executive Order 12958, as amended, ``Classified National  Security Information,'' and its implementing directive at 32 CFR parts  2001 and 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any attempt by news media representatives to obtain classified  information will be reported through the Headquarters Office of Public  Affairs or Installation Public Affairs Office to the Installation  Security Office and Office of Security and Program Protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For classified operations and/or programs managed under the  auspices of a DD Form 254, ``Contract Security Classification  Specification,'' all inquiries concerning this activity will be  responded to by the appropriate PAO official designated in Item 12 on  the DD Form 254.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For classified operations and/or information owned by other  Government agencies (e.g., DOD, DOE), all inquiries will be referred to  the appropriate Agency Public Affairs Officer as established in written  agreements.</p>
