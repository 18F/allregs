A State or  Indian Tribe seeking authorization of a lead-based paint program can  apply for and receive either interim or final approval of the compliance  and enforcement program portion of its lead-based paint program. Indian  Tribes are not required to exercise criminal enforcement jurisdiction as  a condition for program authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim approval. Interim approval of the compliance and  enforcement program portion of the State or Tribal lead-based paint  program may be granted by EPA only once, and subject to a specific  expiration date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To be considered adequate for purposes of obtaining interim  approval for the compliance and enforcement program portion of a State  or Tribal lead-based paint program, a State or Indian Tribe must, in its  application described at Sec. 745.324(a):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrate it has the legal authority and ability to  immediately implement the elements in paragraph (b) of this section.  This demonstration shall include a statement that the State or Indian  Tribe, during the interim approval period, shall carry out a level of  compliance monitoring and enforcement necessary to ensure that the State  or Indian Tribe addresses any significant risks posed by noncompliance  with lead-based paint activity requirements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Present a plan with time frames identified for implementing in  the field each element in paragraph (c) of this section. All elements of  paragraph (c) of this section must be fully implemented no later than 3  years from the date of EPA's interim approval of the compliance and  enforcement program portion of a State or Tribal lead-based paint  program. A statement of resources must be included in the State   or Tribal plan which identifies what resources the State or Indian Tribe  intends to devote to the administration of its lead-based paint  compliance and enforcement program.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Agree to submit to EPA the Summary on Progress and Performance  of lead-based paint compliance and enforcement activities as described  at paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any interim approval granted by EPA for the compliance and  enforcement program portion of a State or Tribal lead-based paint  program will expire no later than 3 years from the date of EPA's interim  approval. One hundred and eighty days prior to this expiration date, a  State or Indian Tribe shall apply to EPA for final approval of the  compliance and enforcement program portion of a State or Tribal lead- based paint program. Final approval shall be given to any State or  Indian Tribe which has in place all of the elements of paragraphs (b),  (c), and (d) of this section. If a State or Indian Tribe does not  receive final approval for the compliance and enforcement program  portion of a State or Tribal lead-based paint program by the date 3  years after the date of EPA's interim approval, the Administrator shall,  by such date, initiate the process to withdraw the State or Indian  Tribe's authorization pursuant to Sec. 745.324(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final approval. Final approval of the compliance and enforcement  program portion of a State or Tribal lead-based paint program can be  granted by EPA either through the application process described at Sec.  745.324(a), or, for States or Indian Tribes which previously received  interim approval as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  through a separate application addressing only the compliance and  enforcement program portion of a State or Tribal lead-based paint  program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the compliance and enforcement program to be considered  adequate for final approval through the application described at Sec.  745.324(a), a State or Indian Tribe must, in its application:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrate it has the legal authority and ability to  immediately implement the elements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Submit a statement of resources which identifies what resources  the State or Indian Tribe intends to devote to the administration of its  lead-based paint compliance and enforcement program.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Agree to submit to EPA the Summary on Progress and Performance  of lead-based paint compliance and enforcement activities as described  at paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For States or Indian Tribes which previously received interim  approval as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in order for  the State or Tribal compliance and enforcement program to be considered  adequate for final approval through a separate application addressing  only the compliance and enforcement program portion of a State or Tribal  lead-based paint program, a State or Indian Tribe must, in its  application:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrate that it has the legal authority and ability to  immediately implement the elements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Submit a statement which identifies the resources the State or  Indian Tribe intends to devote to the administration of its lead-based  paint compliance and enforcement program.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Agree to submit to EPA the Summary on Progress and Performance  of lead-based paint compliance and enforcement activities as described  at paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> To the extent not previously submitted through the application  described at Sec. 745.324(a), submit copies of all applicable State or  Tribal statutes, regulations, standards, and other material that provide  the State or Indian Tribe with authority to administer and enforce the  lead-based paint compliance and enforcement program, and copies of the  policies, certifications, plans, reports, and any other documents that  demonstrate that the program meets the requirements established in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em>  of this section are part of the required elements for the compliance and  enforcement portion of a   State or Tribal lead-based paint program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lead-based paint activities or renovation requirements.

Enforcement personnel must understand case  development procedures and the maintenance of proper case files.  Inspectors must successfully demonstrate knowledge of the requirements  of the particular discipline (e.g.,   abatement supervisor, and/or abatement worker, and/or lead-based paint  inspector, and/or risk assessor, and/or project designer) for which they  have compliance monitoring and enforcement responsibilities. Inspectors  must also be trained in violation discovery, methods of obtaining  consent, evidence gathering, preservation of evidence and chain-of- custody, and sampling procedures. A State or Tribal lead-based paint  compliance and enforcement program must also implement a process for the  continuing education of enforcement and inspection personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance assistance. A State or Tribal lead-based paint  compliance and enforcement program must provide compliance assistance to  the public and the regulated community to facilitate awareness and  understanding of and compliance with State or Tribal requirements  governing the conduct of lead-based paint activities or renovations.
