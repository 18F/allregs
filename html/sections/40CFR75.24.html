pursuant to appendix M of part 51 of this chapter. The owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements of the State. If the State has no monitor data availability requirements for continuous opacity monitoring systems, then the owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements as stated in the data capture provisions of appendix M, part 51 of this chapter.
