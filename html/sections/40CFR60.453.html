The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the coating manufacturer or by analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the coating manufacturer to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coatings used at each facility, by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied each calendar month will be determined as follows.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the mass of VOC's consumed (Mo + Md) during the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.035

If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis. Transfer efficiencies for application methods not listed shall be determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis.
