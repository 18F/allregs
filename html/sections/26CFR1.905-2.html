                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Forms and information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the taxpayer chooses, in  accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.901-1, to claim the benefits of  the foreign tax credit, the claim for credit shall be accompanied by  Form 1116 in the case of an individual or by Form 1118 in the case of a  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The form must be carefully filled in with all the information  called for and with the calculations of credits indicated. Except where  it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that it  is impossible for the taxpayer to furnish such evidence, the taxpayer  must provide upon request the receipt for each such tax payment if  credit is sought for taxes already paid or the return on which each such  accrued tax was based if credit is sought for taxes accrued. The receipt  or return must be either the original, a duplicate original, or a duly  certified or authenticated copy. The preceding two sentences are  applicable for returns whose original due date falls on or after January  1, 1988. Any additional information necessary for the determination  under part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the  Code, of the amount of income derived from sources without the United  States and from each foreign country shall, upon the request of the  district director, be furnished by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer upon  request fails without justification to furnish any such additional  information which is significant, including any significant information  which he is requested to furnish pursuant to Sec. 1.861-8(f)(5) as  proposed in the Federal Register for November 8, 1976, the District  Director may disallow the claim of the taxpayer to the benefits of the  foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Secondary evidence. Where it has been established to the  satisfaction of the District Director that it is impossible to furnish a  receipt for such foreign tax payment, the foreign tax return, or direct  evidence of the amount of tax withheld at the source, the District  Director, may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence thereof as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receipt for payment. In the absence of a receipt for payment of  foreign taxes there shall be submitted a photostatic copy of the check,  draft, or other medium of payment showing the amount and date thereof,  with certification identifying it with the tax claimed to have been  paid, together with evidence establishing that the tax was paid for  taxpayer's account as his own tax on his own income. If credit is  claimed on an accrual method, it must be shown that the tax accrued in  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign tax return. If the foreign tax return is not available,  the foreign tax has not been paid, and credit is claimed on an accrual  method, there shall be submitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A certified statement of the amount shall be submitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excerpts from the taxpayer's accounts showing amounts of  foreign income and tax thereon accrued on its books.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A computation of the foreign tax based on income from the  foreign country carried on the books and at current rates of tax to be  established by data such as excerpts from the foreign law, assessment  notices, or other documentary evidence thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A bond, if deemed necessary by the District Director, filed in  the manner provided in cases where the foreign return is available, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In case a bond is not required, a specific agreement wherein the  taxpayer shall recognize its liability to report the correct amount of  tax when ascertained, as required by the provisions of section 905 (c).  If at any time the foreign tax receipts or foreign tax returns become  available to the taxpayer, they shall be promptly submitted to the  district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tax withheld at source. In the case of taxes withheld at the  source from dividends, interest, royalties, compensation, or other form  of income, where evidence of withholding and of the amount withheld  cannot be secured from those who have made the payments, the district  director may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence of such  withholding and of the amount of the tax so withheld, having due regard  to the taxpayer's books of account and to the rates of taxation  prevailing in the particular foreign country during the period involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit for taxes accrued but not paid. In the case of a credit  sought for a tax accrued but not paid, the district director may, as a  condition precedent to the allowance of a credit, require a bond from  the taxpayer, in addition to Form 1116 or 1118. If such a bond is  required, Form 1117 shall be used by an individual or by a corporation.  It shall be in such sum as the Commissioner may prescribe, and shall be  conditioned for the payment by the taxpayer of any amount of tax found  due upon any redetermination of the tax made necessary by such credit  proving incorrect, with such further conditions as the district director  may require. This bond shall be executed by the taxpayer, or the agent  or representative of the taxpayer, as principal, and by sureties  satisfactory to and approved by the Commissioner. See also 6 U.S.C. 15.

Except  as provided in Sec. 1.905-5T, paragraph (b) of this section applies to  taxes paid or accrued in taxable years of United States taxpayers  beginning on or after November 7, 2007 and to taxes paid or accrued by a  foreign corporation in its taxable years which end with or within a  taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after  November 7, 2007. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997,  and before November 7, 2007, section 986(a), as amended by the Taxpayer  Relief Act of 1997 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, shall  apply. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before  January 1, 1998, Sec. 1.905-3T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised  as of April 1, 2007) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign tax redeterminations. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years  of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007 where  the foreign tax redetermination affects the amount of foreign taxes paid  or accrued by a United States taxpayer. Where the redetermination of  foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the  computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with  respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation,  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to foreign tax  redeterminations occurring in taxable years of a foreign corporation  which end with or within a taxable year of the domestic corporate  shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. For corresponding  rules   applicable to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years  beginning before November 7, 2007, see Sec. Sec. 1.905-3T and 1.905-5T  (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Currency translation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Translation of foreign taxes  taken into account when accrued--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer or a  member of a qualified group (as defined in section 902(b)(2)) that takes  foreign income taxes into account when accrued, the amount of any  foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency that have been paid or  accrued, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, taxes  withheld in foreign currency, or estimated taxes paid in foreign  currency shall be translated into dollars using the average exchange  rate (as defined in Sec. 1.989(b)-1) for the United States taxable year  to which such taxes relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Taxes not paid within two years. Any foreign  income taxes denominated in foreign currency that are paid more than two  years after the close of the United States taxable year to which they  relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of  the date of payment of the foreign taxes. To the extent any accrued  foreign income taxes denominated in foreign currency remain unpaid two  years after the close of the taxable year to which they relate, see  paragraph (b)(3) of this section for translation rules for the required  adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxes paid before taxable year begins. Any foreign income taxes  paid before the beginning of the United States taxable year to which  such taxes relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange  rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, base period means, with respect to any taxable  year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the last day  of such taxable year (see Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D)). Accrued but  unpaid taxes denominated in an inflationary currency shall be translated  into dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States  taxable year to which such taxes relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> shall be translated into  dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States  taxable year to which such taxes relate. For taxable years beginning  after December 31, 2004, and before November 7, 2007, the rules of  Notice   2006-47, 2006-20 IRB 892 (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)), shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Regulated investment companies. In the case of a regulated  investment company (as defined in section 851 and the regulations under  that section) which takes into account income on an accrual basis,  foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to such income shall  be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date the  income accrues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Translation of foreign taxes taken into account when paid. In  the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when  paid, the amount of any foreign tax liability denominated in foreign  currency, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, or  estimated taxes paid in foreign currency shall be translated into  dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of such  foreign taxes. Foreign taxes withheld in foreign currency shall be  translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date on which  such taxes were withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Refunds or other reductions of foreign tax liability. In the  case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when  accrued, a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes  that is attributable to a refund of foreign taxes denominated in foreign  currency, a credit allowed in lieu of a refund, the correction of an  overaccrual, or an adjustment on account of accrued taxes denominated in  foreign currency that were not paid by the date two years after the  close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate, shall be  translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to  translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to  post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of foreign income taxes  taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date  of payment, see paragraph (d) of this section for required adjustments  to reflect a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes  that is attributable to a difference in exchange rates between the date  of accrual and date of payment. In the case of a taxpayer that takes  foreign income taxes into account when paid, a refund or other reduction  in the amount of foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency shall be  translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to  translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. If a refund  or other reduction of foreign taxes relates to foreign taxes paid or  accrued on more than one date, then the refund or other reduction shall  be deemed to be derived from, and shall reduce, the last payment of  foreign taxes first, to the extent of that payment. See paragraphs  (d)(1) (redetermination of United States tax liability for foreign taxes  paid directly by a United States person) and (d)(2)(ii) (method of  adjustment of a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed  earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of refunds of foreign tax. Refunds of foreign tax  shall be allocated to the same separate category as foreign taxes to  which the refunded taxes relate. Refunds are related to foreign taxes of  a separate category if the foreign tax that was refunded was imposed  with respect to that separate category. See section 904(d) and Sec.  1.904-6 concerning the allocation of taxes to separate categories of  income. Earnings and profits of a foreign corporation in the separate  category to which the refund relates shall be increased to reflect the  foreign tax refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Basis of foreign currency refunded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A recipient  of a refund of foreign tax shall determine its basis in the currency  refunded under the following rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> United States dollar functional currency. If the functional  currency of the qualified business unit (QBU) (as defined in section 989  and the regulations under that section) that paid the tax and received  the refund is the United States dollar or the person receiving the  refund is not a QBU, then the recipient's basis in the foreign currency  refunded shall be the dollar value of the refund determined under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section by using, as appropriate, either the  average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate or  the other exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when  originally claimed as a credit or   added to post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nondollar functional currency. If the functional currency of  the QBU receiving the refund is not the United States dollar and is  different from the currency in which the foreign tax was paid, then the  recipient's basis in the foreign currency refunded shall be equal to the  functional currency value of the non-functional currency refund  translated into functional currency at the exchange rate between the  functional currency and the non-functional currency. Such exchange rate  is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by substituting the  words ``functional currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using, as  appropriate, either the average exchange rate for the taxable year to  which such taxes relate or the other exchange rate that was used to  translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to  post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Functional currency tax liabilities. If the functional currency  of the QBU receiving the refund is the currency in which the refund was  made, then the recipient's basis in the currency received shall be the  amount of the functional currency received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Foreign currency gain or loss. For purposes of determining  foreign currency gain or loss on the initial payment of accrued foreign  tax in a non-functional currency, see section 988. For purposes of  determining subsequent foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition  of non-functional currency the basis of which is determined under this  paragraph (b)(5), see section 988(c)(1)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Foreign tax redetermination. For purposes of this section and  Sec. 1.905-4T, the term foreign tax redetermination means a change in  the foreign tax liability that may affect a taxpayer's foreign tax  credit. A foreign tax redetermination includes: accrued taxes that when  paid differ from the amounts added to post-1986 foreign income taxes or  claimed as credits by the taxpayer (such as corrections to overaccruals  and additional payments); accrued taxes that are not paid before the  date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes  relate; any tax paid that is refunded in whole or in part; and, for  taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the  date of payment, a difference between the dollar value of the accrued  tax and the dollar value of the tax paid attributable to fluctuations in  the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the  date of accrual and the date of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Redetermination of United States tax liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Foreign  taxes paid directly by a United States person. If a foreign tax  redetermination occurs with respect to foreign tax paid or accrued by or  on behalf of a United States taxpayer, then a redetermination of the  United States tax liability is required for the taxable year for which  the foreign tax was claimed as a credit. See Sec. 1.905-4T(b) which  requires notification to the IRS of a foreign tax redetermination with  respect to which a redetermination of United States liability is  required, and see section 905(b) and the regulations under that section  which require that a taxpayer substantiate that a foreign tax was paid  and provide all necessary information establishing its entitlement to  the foreign tax credit. However, a redetermination of United States tax  liability is not required (and a taxpayer need not notify the IRS) if  the foreign taxes are taken into account when accrued but translated  into dollars as of the date of payment, the difference between the  dollar value of the accrued tax and the dollar value of the tax paid is  attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency  relative to the dollar between the date of accrual and the date of  payment, and the amount of the foreign tax redetermination with respect  to each foreign country is less than the lesser of ten thousand dollars  or two percent of the total dollar amount of the foreign tax initially  accrued with respect to that foreign country for the United States  taxable year. In such case, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to  the taxpayer's United States tax liability in the taxable year during  which the foreign tax redetermination occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 or 960--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Redetermination of United States tax liability not required. Subject to  the special rule of paragraph   (d)(3) of this section, a redetermination of United States tax liability  is not required to account for the effect of a redetermination of  foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation on the foreign  taxes deemed paid by a United States corporation under section 902 or  960. Instead, appropriate upward or downward adjustments shall be made,  in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, at the time of  the foreign tax redetermination to the foreign corporation's pools of  post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes to  reflect the effect of the foreign tax redetermination in calculating  foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to distributions and inclusions  (and the amount of such distributions and inclusions) that are  includible in the United States taxable year in which the foreign tax  redetermination occurred and subsequent taxable years. See Sec. 1.905- 4T(b)(2) for notification requirements where a redetermination of  foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the  computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960, and  the taxpayer is required to adjust the foreign corporation's pools of  post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes  under this paragraph (d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings  and post-1986 foreign income taxes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reduction in foreign tax paid or  accrued. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes  in the appropriate separate category shall be reduced by the United  States dollar amount of a foreign tax refund or other reduction in the  amount of foreign tax paid or accrued, translated into United States  dollars as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A foreign  corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the  appropriate separate category shall be increased by the functional  currency amount of the foreign tax refund or other reduction in the  amount of foreign tax paid or accrued. The allocation of the refund or  other adjustment to the appropriate separate categories shall be made in  accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section and Sec. 1.904-6. If a  foreign corporation receives a refund of foreign tax in a currency other  than its functional currency, that refund shall be translated into its  functional currency, for purposes of computing the increase to its pool  of post-1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the  functional currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words ``functional  currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using the same average or spot  rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating  such foreign taxes into United States dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional foreign tax paid or accrued. A foreign corporation's  pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate  category shall be increased by the United States dollar amount of the  additional foreign tax paid or accrued, translated in accordance with  the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A foreign  corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the  appropriate separate category shall be decreased by the functional  currency amount of the additional foreign tax paid or accrued. The  allocation of the additional amount of foreign tax among the separate  categories shall be made in accordance with Sec. 1.904-6. If a foreign  corporation pays or accrues foreign tax in a currency other than its  functional currency, that tax shall be translated into its functional  currency, for purposes of computing the decrease to its pool of post- 1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the functional  currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words ``functional  currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using the same average or spot  rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating  such foreign taxes into United States dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> do  not apply to distributions or inclusions to a United States person. See  paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section for rules relating to actual or  deemed distributions made to a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (d)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year  taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar  and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that  currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign  taxes. In 2008, CFC accrued and paid 100u of foreign income taxes with  respect to non-subpart F income. The average exchange rate for 2008 was  $1:1u. In 2009, CFC received a refund of 50u of foreign taxes with  respect to its non-subpart F income in 2008. CFC made no distributions  to P in 2008. In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section  and subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in 2009 CFC's pool of  post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced by $50 (because the  refund must be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was  used to translate such amount when added to CFC's post-1986 foreign  income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) and  the CFC's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by  50u (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by  the functional currency amount of the refund received). An income  adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988  with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not  required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's  functional currency.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in  2008, CFC had general category post-1986 undistributed earnings  attributable to non-subpart F income of 200u (net of foreign taxes), and  CFC accrued and paid 160u in foreign income taxes with respect to those  earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. Also in 2008,  CFC made a distribution to P of 50u, and P was deemed to have paid $40  of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/200u x $160). In  2009, CFC received a refund of foreign taxes of 5u with respect to its  nonsubpart F income in 2008. Also in 2009, CFC made a distribution to P  of 50u. CFC had no income and paid no foreign taxes in 2009. In  accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, CFC's pool of  general category post-1986 foreign income taxes is reduced in 2009 by $5  to $115 (because the refund must be translated into dollars using the  exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when added to CFC's  post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange  rate for 2008), and CFC's pool of general category post-1986  undistributed earnings must be increased in 2009 by 5u to 155u (because  the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by the functional  currency amount of the refund received). (An income adjustment  reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect  to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not required because  the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's functional  currency.) A redetermination of P's deemed paid credit and U.S. tax for  2008 is not required, because the 5u refund, if taken into account in  2008, would have reduced P's deemed paid taxes by less than 10% (50u/ 205u x $155 = $37.80). See paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. P is  deemed to pay $37.10 of foreign taxes with respect to the distribution  in 2009 of 50u (50u/155u x $115).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC1 is a foreign corporation that is wholly-owned by  P, a domestic corporation. CFC2 is a foreign corporation that is wholly- owned by CFC1. The functional currency of CFC1 and CFC2 is the u, and  the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings of CFC1 and CFC2 are  maintained in that currency. CFC1, CFC2, and P use the average exchange  rate to translate foreign income taxes. In 2008, CFC2 had post-1986  undistributed earnings attributable to non-subpart F income of 100u (net  of foreign taxes) and paid 100u in foreign income taxes with respect to  those earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. CFC1 had  no income and   no earnings and profits other than those resulting from distributions  from CFC2, as provided in either Situation 1 or Situation 2. CFC1 paid  no foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Situation 1. In 2009, CFC2 received a refund of foreign taxes  of 25u with respect to its 2008 taxable year. As of the close of 2009,  CFC2 had 125u of post-1986 undistributed earnings (100u + 25u) and $75  of post-1986 foreign income taxes ($100-$25). In 2010, CFC2 made a  distribution to CFC1 of 50u. CFC1 was deemed to have paid $30 of foreign  taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/125u x $75). (An income  adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988  with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not  required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's  functional currency.) At the end of 2010, CFC2 had 75u of post-1986  undistributed earnings (125u-50u) and $45 of post-1986 foreign income  taxes ($75-$30).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Situation 2. The facts are the same as in Example 3(ii),  Situation 1, except that CFC2 made a distribution of 50u in 2009 and  received a refund of 75u of foreign tax in 2010. In 2009, the amount of  foreign taxes deemed paid by CFC1 is $50 (50u/100u x $100). In  accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the pools of  post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1, as well as CFC2, must be  adjusted in 2010, because the 2010 refund would otherwise have the  effect of reducing below zero CFC2's pool of post-1986 foreign income  taxes. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, the pools would have  to be adjusted in 2009, and a redetermination of P's United States tax  liability would be required, if P had received or accrued a distribution  or inclusion from CFC1 or CFC2 in 2009 and computed an amount of foreign  taxes deemed paid. CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes must be  reduced in 2010 by $42.86, determined as follows: $50 (foreign taxes  deemed paid on the distribution from CFC2) minus $7.14 (the foreign  taxes that would have been deemed paid had the refund occurred prior to  the distribution (50u/175u x $25)). CFC2's pool of foreign taxes must be  reduced in 2010 by $32.14, determined as follows: $75 (75u refund  translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to  translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income  taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) minus $42.86  (the adjustment to CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes). (An  income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section  988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not  required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's  functional currency.) The following reflects the pools of post-1986  undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1 and  CFC2.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Post-1986 earnings (u)     Foreign taxes ($) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CFC2: 2008..........................................................                      100                      100 2009..........................................................              100-50 = 50              100-50 = 50 2010..........................................................            50 + 75 = 125         50-32.14 = 17.86 CFC1: 2009..........................................................                       50                       50 2010..........................................................                       50          50-42.86 = 7.14 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hyperinflationary currencies.

A  redetermination of United States tax liability is required if a foreign  tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign taxes paid by a  foreign corporation and such foreign tax redetermination, if taken into  account in the taxable year of the foreign corporation to which the  foreign tax redetermination relates, has the effect of reducing by ten  percent or   more the domestic corporate shareholder's foreign taxes deemed paid  under section 902 or 960 with respect to a distribution or inclusion  from the foreign corporation in any taxable year of the domestic  corporate shareholder. If a redetermination of United States tax is  required under the preceding sentence for any taxable year, a  redetermination of United States tax is also required for all subsequent  taxable years in which the domestic corporate shareholder received or  accrued a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P use  the calendar year as their taxable year. CFC has a functional currency,  the u, other than the dollar, and its pool of post-1986 undistributed  earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average  exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. As of January 1, 2008,  CFC had 500u of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings and  $200 of general category post-1986 foreign income taxes. In 2008, when  the average exchange rate for the year was $1:1u, CFC earned general  category income of 600u, accrued 100u of foreign income tax with respect  to that income, and made a distribution to P of 100u, 10% of CFC's post- 1986 undistributed earnings of 1,000u. P was deemed to have paid $30 of  foreign income taxes in 2008 with respect to that distribution (100u/ 1,000u x $300). In 2009, CFC paid its actual foreign tax liability for  2008 of 80u. Also in 2009, for which the average exchange rate was  $1:1.5u, CFC earned 500u of general category income, accrued 150u of tax  with respect to that income, and distributed 100u to P. In 2010, CFC  incurred a general category loss of (500u) and accrued no foreign tax.  The loss was carried back to 2008 for foreign tax purposes, and CFC  received a refund in 2011 of all 80u of foreign taxes paid for its 2008  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result in 2009. If the 20u overaccrual of tax for 2008 were  taken into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986  undistributed earnings would be 1,020u, CFC's general category post-1986  foreign income taxes would be $280, and P would be deemed to pay $27.45  of tax with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1020u x $280  = $27.45). Because $2.55 is less than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes  deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, P is not required to  redetermine its deemed paid credit and U.S. tax liability for 2008 in  2009. Instead, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are  reduced by $20 in 2009 (because the overaccrual for 2008 is translated  into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such  amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is,  $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008), and the corresponding pool  of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings is increased by 20u  in 2009 (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool is increased  by the functional currency amount of the overaccrual). CFC's general  category post-1986 undistributed earnings are also increased in 2009 to  1270u by the 350u earned in 2009 (900u + 20u + 350u = 1270u), and CFC's  general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are increased by $100 to  $350 ($270 - $20 + $100). P is deemed to pay $27.56 of foreign income  taxes in 2009 with respect to the 100u distribution from CFC in that  year (100u/1270u x $350).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Result in 2011. If the 80u refund of tax for 2008 were taken  into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed  earnings would be 1,100u, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign  income taxes would be $200, and P would be deemed to pay $18.18 of tax  with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1,100u x $200 =  $18.18). Because $11.82 is more than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes  deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)  of this section, P is required to redetermine its deemed paid credit and  U.S. tax liability for 2008 and 2009 in 2011. As determined in 2011,  CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings for 2009 are 1350u (1,100u as  revised for 2008, less 100u distributed in 2008, plus 350u earned in  2009), and its post-1986 foreign income taxes for 2009 are $281.82 ($200  as revised for 2008, less $18.18 deemed paid in 2008, plus $100 accrued  for 2009). As redetermined in 2011, P's deemed paid credit with respect  to the 100u distribution from CFC in 2009 is $20.88 (100u/1350u x  $281.82).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deficit in foreign tax pool. A redetermination of United States  tax liability is required if a foreign tax redetermination occurs with  respect to foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to a subpart F  inclusion or an actual distribution which has the effect of reducing  below zero the distributing foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes  in any separate category. Whether a foreign corporation's pool of  foreign taxes is reduced below zero shall be determined at the close of  the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the foreign tax  redetermination occurred. In no case shall taxes paid or accrued with  respect to one separate category   be applied to offset a negative balance in any other separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year  taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar,  and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that  currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign  taxes. The average exchange rate for both 2008 and 2009 was $1:1u. In  2008, CFC earned 200u of general category income, accrued and paid 100u  of foreign taxes with respect to that income, and made a distribution to  P of 50u, half of CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings of 100u. P is  deemed to have paid $50 of foreign taxes with respect to that  distribution (50u/100u x $100). In 2009, CFC received a refund of all  100u of foreign taxes related to the general category income for 2008.  In 2009, CFC earned an additional 290u of income, 200u of which was  passive category income and 90u of which was general category income,  and accrued and paid 95u of foreign tax, 40u of which was with respect  to the passive category income and 45u of which was with respect to the  general category income. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this  section, P is required to redetermine its United States tax liability  for 2008 to account for the foreign tax redetermination occurring in  2009 because, if an adjustment to CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income  taxes in the general category were made, the pool would be ($5). A  deficit is not permitted to be carried in CFC's pool of post-1986  foreign income taxes in any separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Reduction of corporate level tax on distribution of earnings  and profits. If a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign  corporation receives a distribution out of previously taxed earnings and  profits and a foreign country has imposed tax on the income of the  controlled foreign corporation, which tax is reduced on distribution of  the earnings and profits of the corporation, then the United States  shareholder shall redetermine its United States tax liability for the  year or years affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Foreign tax imposed on foreign refund. If the redetermination of  foreign tax for a taxable year or years is occasioned by the refund to  the taxpayer of taxes paid to a foreign country or possession of the  United States and the foreign country or possession imposed tax on the  refund, then the amount of the refund shall be considered to be reduced  by the amount of any tax described in section 901 imposed by the foreign  country or possession of the United States with respect to such refund.

The rules of this section apply if,  as a result of a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in Sec. 1.905- 3T(c)), a redetermination of United States tax liability is required  under section 905(c) and Sec. 1.905-3T(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of notification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Redetermination of United  States tax liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs  (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (b)(3) of this section, any taxpayer for which a  redetermination of United States tax liability is required must notify  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the foreign tax redetermination by  filing an amended return, Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit--Corporations)  or Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit), and the statement required under  paragraph (c) of this section for the taxable year with respect to which  a redetermination of United States tax liability is required. Such  notification must be filed within the time prescribed by this paragraph  (b) and contain the information described in paragraph (c) of this  section. Where a foreign tax redetermination requires an individual to  redetermine the individual's United States tax liability, and as a  result of such foreign tax redetermination the amount of creditable  taxes paid or accrued by such individual during the taxable year does  not exceed the applicable dollar limitation in section 904(k), the  individual shall not be required to file Form 1116 with   the amended return for such taxable year if the individual satisfies the  requirements of section 904(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduction in amount of foreign tax liability. Except as  provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (b)(3) of this section, for  each taxable year of the taxpayer with respect to which a  redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of  a foreign tax redetermination that reduces the amount of foreign taxes  paid or accrued, or included in the computation of foreign taxes deemed  paid, the taxpayer must file a separate notification for each such  taxable year by the due date (with extensions) of the original return  for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination  occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increase in amount of foreign tax liability.

Filing of such notification  within the prescribed period shall constitute a claim for refund of  United States tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Multiple redeterminations of United States tax liability for  same taxable year. Where more than one foreign tax redetermination  requires a redetermination of United States tax liability for the same  taxable year of the taxpayer and those redeterminations occur within two  consecutive taxable years of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may file for  such taxable year one amended return, Form 1118 or 1116, and the  statement required under paragraph (c) of this section that reflect all  such foreign tax redeterminations. If the taxpayer chooses to file one  notification for such redeterminations, the taxpayer must file such  notification by the due date (with extensions) of the original return  for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the first foreign tax  redetermination that reduces foreign tax liability occurred. Where a  foreign tax redetermination with respect to the taxable year for which a  redetermination of United States tax liability is required occurs after  the date for providing such notification, more than one amended return  may be required with respect to that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax. Where a foreign  tax redetermination requires a redetermination of United States tax  liability that would otherwise result in an additional amount of United  States tax due, but such amount is eliminated as a result of a carryback  or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c), the taxpayer  may, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of  this section, notify the IRS of such redetermination by attaching a  statement to the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in  which the foreign tax redetermination occurs. Such statement must be  filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the  taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination  occurred and contain the information described in Sec. 1.904-2(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Example.

X conducts  business through a branch in Country M, the currency of which is the m,  and also conducts business through a branch in Country N, the currency  of which is the n. X uses the average exchange rate to translate foreign  income taxes. Assume that X is able to claim a credit under section 901  for all foreign taxes paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 2008, X accrued and paid 100m of Country M taxes with  respect to 400m of foreign source general category income.

The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1n. X claimed  a foreign tax credit of $150 ($100 (100m at $1:1m) + $50 (50n at $1:1n))  with respect to its foreign source general category income on its United  States tax return for 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In 2009, X accrued and paid 100n of Country N taxes with  respect to 300n of foreign source general category income.

X claimed a foreign tax credit of  $150 (100n at $1.5:1n) with respect to its foreign source   general category income on its United States tax return for 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On June 15, 2012, when the spot exchange rate was $1.40:1n, X  received a refund of 10n from Country N, and, on March 15, 2013, when  the spot exchange rate was $1.20:1m, X was assessed by and paid Country  M an additional 20m of tax. Both payments were with respect to X's  foreign source general category income in 2008. On May 15, 2013, when  the spot exchange rate was $1.45:1n, X received a refund of 5n from  Country N with respect to its foreign source general category income in  2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> X must redetermine its United States tax liability for both 2008  and 2009. With respect to 2008, X must notify the IRS of the June 15,  2012, refund of 10n from Country N that reduced X's foreign tax  liability by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement  required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2008 by the due date of  the original return (with extensions) for 2012. The amended return and  Form 1118 must reduce the amount of foreign taxes claimed as a credit  under section 901 by $10 (10n refund translated at the average exchange  rate for 2008, or $1:1n (see Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(3)). X will recognize  foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 in or after 2012 on the  conversion of the 10n refund into dollars. With respect to the March 15,  2013, additional assessment of 20m by Country M, X must notify the IRS  within the time period provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A), increasing the  foreign taxes available as a credit by $24 (20m translated at the  exchange rate on the date of payment, or $1.20:1m). See sections  986(a)(1)(B)(i) and 986(a)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(1)(ii)(A). X may  so notify the IRS by filing a second amended return, Form 1118, and the  statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2008, within the  time period provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A). Alternatively, when X  redetermines its United States tax liability for 2008 to take into  account the 10n refund from Country N which occurred in 2012, X may also  take into account the 20m additional assessment by Country M which  occurred on March 15, 2013. See Sec. 1.905-4T(b)(1)(iv). Where X  reflects both foreign tax redeterminations on the same amended return,  Form 1118, and in the statement required in paragraph (c) of this  section for 2008, the amount of X's foreign taxes available as a credit  would be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reduced by $10 (10n refund translated at $1:1n) and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Increased by $24 (20m additional assessment translated at the  exchange rate on the date of payment, March 15, 2013, or $1.20:1m). The  foreign taxes available as a credit therefore would be increased by $14  ($24 (additional assessment) - $10 (refund)). The due date of the 2008  amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c)  of this section reflecting foreign tax redeterminations in both years  would be the due date (with extensions) of X's original return for 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to 2009, X must notify the IRS by filing an  amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c)  of this section for 2009 that is separate from that filed for 2008. The  amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c)  of this section for 2009 must be filed by the due date (with extensions)  of X's original return for 2013. The amended return and Form 1118 must  reduce the amount of foreign taxes claimed as a credit under section 901  by $7.50 (5n refund translated at the average exchange rate for 2009, or  $1.50:1n). X will recognize foreign currency gain or loss under section  988 in or after 2013 on the conversion of the 5n refund into dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, a taxpayer may file one notification for  all such redeterminations in lieu of filing a separate notification for  each such redetermination.

Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, X is required to  notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination by filing an amended  return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this  section for its 2008 taxable year by September 15, 2010 (the due date  (with extensions) of the original return for X's 2009 taxable year). On  December 15, 2010, the IRS hand delivers an opening letter concerning  the examination of the return for X's 2008 taxable year, and the opening  conference for such examination is scheduled for January 15, 2011.  Because the date for notifying the IRS of the foreign tax  redetermination under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section precedes the  date of the opening conference concerning the examination of the return  for X's 2008 taxable year, paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not  apply, and X must notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination by  filing a amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in  paragraph (c) of this section for the 2008 taxable year by September 15,  2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notification contents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In addition to satisfying  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the taxpayer must  furnish a statement that contains information sufficient for the IRS to  redetermine the taxpayer's United States tax liability where such a  redetermination is required under section 905(c), and to verify  adjustments to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post- 1986 foreign income taxes where such adjustments are required under  Sec. 1.905-   3T(d)(2). The information must be in a form that enables the IRS to  verify and compare the original computations with respect to a claimed  foreign tax credit, the revised computations resulting from the foreign  tax redetermination, and the net changes resulting therefrom. The  statement must include the taxpayer's name, address, identifying number,  and the taxable year or years of the taxpayer that are affected by the  foreign tax redetermination. In addition, the taxpayer must provide the  information described in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, as  appropriate. If the statement is submitted to the IRS under paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, which provides requirements with respect to  reporting by taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size  Business Division, the statement must also include the following  declaration signed by a person authorized to sign the return of the  taxpayer: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined  this written statement, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this  written statement is true, correct, and complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>; and information sufficient  to determine any interest due from or owing to the taxpayer, including  the amount of any interest paid by the foreign government to the  taxpayer and the dates received.

Where a redetermination of United States tax  liability results in an amount of additional tax due, but the carryback  or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c) only  partially eliminates such amount, the taxpayer must also provide the  information required in Sec. 1.904-2(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> to account  for the effect of a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a  foreign corporation on foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or  960, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) and  (c)(2) of this section, the taxpayer must provide the balances of the  pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income  taxes before and after adjusting the pools in accordance with the rules  of Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(2), the dates and amounts of any dividend  distributions or other inclusions made out of earnings and profits for  the affected year or years, and the amount of earnings and profits from  which such dividends were paid for the affected year or years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>-3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interest and penalties--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a redetermination of  United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax  redetermination, interest shall be computed on the underpayment or  overpayment in accordance with sections 6601 and 6611 and the  regulations under these sections. No interest shall be assessed or  collected on any underpayment resulting from a refund of foreign tax for  any period before the receipt of the refund, except to the extent  interest was paid by the foreign country or possession of the United  States on the refund for the period. In no case, however, shall interest  assessed and collected pursuant to the preceding sentence for any period  before receipt of the foreign tax refund exceed the amount that  otherwise would have been assessed and collected under section 6601 and  the regulations under this section for that period. Interest shall be  assessed from the time the taxpayer (or the foreign corporation of which  the taxpayer is a shareholder) receives a refund until the taxpayer pays  the additional tax due the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Imposition of penalty.

This paragraph (f)(2)  applies to any foreign tax redetermination (as defined in Sec. 1.905- 3T(c)) which occurred in any of the three taxable years of a United  States taxpayer immediately preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year  beginning on or after November 7, 2007; reduced the amount of foreign  taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer; and requires a redetermination of  United States tax liability for any taxable year. This paragraph (f)(2)  also applies to any redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a  foreign corporation which occurred in a taxable year of the foreign  corporation which ends with or within any of the three taxable years of  a domestic corporate shareholder immediately preceding such  shareholder's first taxable year beginning on or after November 7, 2007;  reduced foreign taxes included in the computation of foreign taxes  deemed paid by such shareholder under section 902 or 960; and requires a  redetermination of United States tax liability under Sec. 1.905- 3T(d)(3) for any taxable year.

Such  notification must be filed no later than the due date (with extensions)  of the original return for the taxpayer's first taxable year following  the taxable year in which these regulations are first applicable. Where  the foreign tax redetermination requires an individual to redetermine  the individual's United States tax liability, and as a result of such  foreign tax redetermination the amount of creditable taxes paid or  accrued by such individual during the taxable year does not exceed the  applicable dollar limitation in section 904(k), the individual shall not  be required to file Form 1116 with the amended return for such taxable  year if the individual satisfies the requirements of section 904(k). The  rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section (concerning  multiple redeterminations of United States tax liability for the same  taxable year, and the carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax)  shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> shall not apply where the due date  specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for providing notice  of the foreign tax redetermination precedes the latest of the opening  conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter  concerning an examination of the return for the taxable year for which a  redetermination of United States tax liability is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Interest and penalties.
