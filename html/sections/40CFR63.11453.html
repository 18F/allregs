heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Following initial adjustment, you shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each new affected furnace that is subject to the emission limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart and is controlled with an ESP, you must install, operate, and maintain according to the manufacturer's specifications, one or more continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS) for measuring and recording the secondary voltage and secondary electrical current to each field of the ESP according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (13) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CPMS must have an accuracy of 1 percent of the secondary voltage
