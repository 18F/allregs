The application must be submitted on Form NRC-398 and include a statement signed by an authorized representative of the facility licensee by whom the applicant will be employed that states in detail the extent of the applicant's additional training since the denial and certifies that

the applicant is ready for re-examination. An applicant may file a third application six months after the date of denial of the second application, and may file further successive applications two years after the date of denial of each prior application. The applicant shall submit each successive application on Form NRC-398 and include a statement of additional training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An applicant who has passed either the written examination or operating test and failed the other may request in a new application on Form NRC-398 to be excused from re-examination on the portions of the examination or test which the applicant has passed. The Commission may in its discretion grant the request, if it determines that sufficient justification is presented.</p>
