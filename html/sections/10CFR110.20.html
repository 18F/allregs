                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person may use an NRC general license as authority to export  or import nuclear equipment or material, if the nuclear equipment or  material to be exported or imported is covered by the NRC general  licenses described in Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 110.27. If an export or  import is not covered by the NRC general licenses described in  Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 110.27, a person must file an application with  the Commission for a specific license in accordance with Sec. Sec.  110.31 through 110.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In response to a petition or on its own initiative, the  Commission may issue a general license for export or import if it  determines that any exports or imports made under the general license  will not be inimical to the common defense and security or constitute an  unreasonable risk to the public health and safety and otherwise meet  applicable statutory requirements. A general license is issued as a  regulation after a rulemaking proceeding under subpart K of this part.  Issuance of a general license is coordinated with the Executive Branch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A general license does not relieve a person from complying with  the regulations of other Government agencies applicable to exports or  imports under their authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A general license for export may not be used if the exporter  knows, or has reason to believe, that the material will be used in any  illegal activity or any activity related to isotope separation, chemical  reprocessing, heavy water production or the fabrication of nuclear fuel  containing plutonium, unless these activities are generically authorized  under an appropriate agreement for cooperation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person who uses an NRC general license as the authority to  export or import may cite on the shipping documents the section of this  part which authorizes the described export or import under general  license, as a means of expediting U.S. Customs Service's processing of  the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As specified in Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 110.26, 110.28,  110.29, and 110.30 only certain countries are eligible recipients of  equipment or material under NRC general licenses to export. The  Commission will closely monitor these countries and may at any time  remove a country from a general license in response to significant  adverse developments in the country involved. A key factor in this  regard is the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country.
