                            <p class="depth0">Deregistration of a program may be effected upon the voluntary action of the sponsor by submitting a request for cancellation of the registration in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or upon reasonable cause, by the Registration Agency instituting formal deregistration proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deregistration at the request of the sponsor. The Registration Agency may cancel the registration of an apprenticeship program by written acknowledgment of such request stating the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The registration is cancelled at the sponsor's request, and the effective date thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That, within 15 days of the date of the acknowledgment, the sponsor will notify all apprentices of such cancellation and the effective date; that such cancellation automatically deprives the apprentice of individual registration; that the deregistration of the program removes the apprentice from coverage for Federal purposes which require the Secretary of Labor's approval of an apprenticeship program, and that all apprentices are referred to the Registration Agency for information about potential transfer to other registered apprenticeship programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deregistration by the registration agency upon reasonable cause. (1)(i) Deregistration proceedings may be undertaken when the apprenticeship program is not conducted, operated, or administered in accordance with the program's registered provisions or with the requirements of this part, including not but limited to: failure to provide on-the-job learning; failure to provide related instruction; failure to pay the apprentice a progressively increasing schedule of wages consistent with

the apprentices skills acquired; or persistent and significant failure to perform successfully. Deregistration proceedings for violation of equal opportunity requirements must be processed in accordance with the provisions under 29 CFR part 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, persistent and significant failure to perform successfully occurs when a program sponsor consistently fails to register at least one apprentice, shows a pattern of poor quality assessment results over a period of several years, demonstrates an ongoing pattern of very low completion rates over a period of several years, or shows no indication of improvement in the areas identified by the Registration Agency during a review process as requiring corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where it appears the program is not being operated in accordance with the registered standards or with requirements of this part, the Registration Agency must notify the program sponsor in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The notice sent to the program sponsor's contact person must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be sent by registered or certified mail, with return receipt requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State the shortcoming(s) and the remedy required; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State that a determination of reasonable cause for deregistration will be made unless corrective action is effected within 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Upon request by the sponsor for good cause, the 30-day term may be extended for another 30 days. During the period for corrective action, the Registration Agency must assist the sponsor in every reasonable way to achieve conformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the required correction is not effected within the allotted time, the Registration Agency must send a notice to the sponsor, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, stating the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The notice is sent under this paragraph;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain deficiencies were called to the sponsor's attention (enumerating them and the remedial measures requested, with the dates of such occasions and letters), and that the sponsor has failed or refused to effect correction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based upon the stated deficiencies and failure to remedy them, a determination has been made that there is reasonable cause to deregister the program and the program may be deregistered unless, within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, the sponsor requests a hearing with the applicable Registration Agency; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the sponsor does not request a hearing, the entire matter will be submitted to the Administrator, Office of Apprenticeship, for a decision on the record with respect to deregistration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the sponsor does not request a hearing, the Registration Agency will transmit to the Administrator a report containing all pertinent facts and circumstances concerning the nonconformity, including the findings and recommendation for deregistration, and copies of all relevant documents and records. Statements concerning interviews, meetings and conferences will include the time, date, place, and persons present. The Administrator will make a final order on the basis of the record presented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the sponsor requests a hearing, the Registration Agency will transmit to the Administrator a report containing all the data listed in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, and the Administrator will refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. An Administrative Law Judge will convene a hearing in accordance with Sec. 29.10, and issue a decision as required in Sec. 29.10(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Every order of deregistration must contain a provision that the sponsor must, within 15 days of the effective date of the order, notify all registered apprentices of the deregistration of the program; the effective date thereof; that such cancellation automatically deprives the apprentice of individual registration; that the deregistration removes the apprentice from coverage for Federal purposes which require the Secretary of Labor's approval of an apprenticeship program; and that all apprentices are referred to the Registration Agency for information about potential transfer to other registered apprenticeship programs.</p>
