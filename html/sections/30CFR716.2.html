                            <p class="depth0">The permittee conducting surface coal mining and reclamation  operations on natural slopes that exceed 20 degrees, or on lesser slopes  that require measures to protect the area from disturbance, as  determined by the regulatory authority after consideration of soils,  climate, the method of operation, geology, and other regional  characteristics, shall meet the following performance standards. The  standards of this section do not apply where mining is done on a flat or  gently rolling terrain with an occasional steep slope through which the  mining proceeds and leaves a plain or predominantly flat area; or where  the mining is governed by Sec. 716.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Spoil, waste materials or debris, including that from clearing  and grubbing, and abandoned or disabled equipment, shall not be placed  or allowed to remain on the downslope.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The highwall shall be completely covered with spoil and the  disturbed are a graded to comply with the provisions of Sec. 715.14 of  this chapter. Land above the highwall shall not be disturbed unless the  regulatory authority finds that the disturbance will facilitate  compliance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Material in excess of that required to meet the provisions of  Sec. 715.14 of this chapter shall be disposed of in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 715.15 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Woody materials may be buried in the backfilled area only when  burial does not cause, or add to, instability of the backfill. Woody  materials may be chipped and distributed through the backfill when  approved by the regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Variances from approximate original contour restoration  requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to surface coal mining operations  on steep slopes where the operation is not to be reclaimed to achieve  the approximate original contour and is not a mountaintop removal  operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The objective of this subsection is to allow for a variance from  the approximate original contour restoration requirements on steep  slopes to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Improve watershed control of the area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allow the land to be used for an industrial, commercial,  residential, or public use, including recreational facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The regulatory authority may grant a variance from the  requirement for restoration of the affected lands to their approximate  original contour only if it first finds, in writing, on the basis of a  showing made by the permittee, that all of the following requirements  are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permittee has demonstrated that the purpose of the variance  is to   make the lands to be affected within the permit area suitable for an  industrial, commercial, residential, or public use postmining land use  and that the proposed industrial, commercial, residential, or public use  is likely to occur.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed use, after consultation with the appropriate land- use planning agencies, if any, constitutes an equal or better economic  or public use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The permittee has demonstrated that compliance with the  requirements for acceptable alternative postmining industrial,  commercial, residential or public land uses of 30 CFR 715.13 has been  achieved except for the requirement at Sec. 715.13(d)(3) and (4) to  provide letters of commitment. The permittee must demonstrate to the  regulatory authority that necessary public facilities are likely to be  provided and that the plan is financially feasible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The permittee has demonstrated that the watershed of the area  will be improved as compared to the condition of the watershed before  mining. The watershed will be deemed improved only if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> There will be a reduction in the amount of total suspended  solids or other pollutants discharged to ground or surface waters from  the area as compared to such discharges; or, there will be reduced flood  hazards or more even flow within the watershed containing the area due  to reduction of the peak flow discharges from precipitation events or  thaws; or any other criterion authority in the granting of the variance.  While improving one or more variables, the permittee must also at least  maintain the variables not improved at their premining levels;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The total volume of flows from the proposed affected lands,  during every season of the year, will not vary in a way that adversely  affects the ecology of any surface water or any existing or planned use  of surface or ground water; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The appropriate State environmental agency approves the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The permittee has demonstrated that the owner of the surface of  the lands within the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, as  a part of the application, that a variance be granted. The request shall  be made separately from any surface owner consent given for the  operation and shall show an understanding that the variance could not be  granted without the surface owner's request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The proposal is designed and certified by a qualified  registered professional engineer in conformance with professional  standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and  configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All other requirements of the Act and these regulations will  be met by the proposed operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Every permittee who obtains a variance under this subsection  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Backfill completely the highwall with spoil material, in a  manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3 using  general geotechnical analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Improve the watershed control of the area by reducing the peak  flow from precipitation or thaw or reducing the total suspended solids  or other pollutants in the surface water discharge during precipitation  or thaw or by attaining the criteria approved by the regulatory  authority in the granting of the variance. While improving one or more  variables, the permittee must also at least maintain the variables not  improved at their premining levels. The total volume of flow during  every season of the year shall not vary in a way that adversely affects  the ecology of any surface or ground water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Disturb land above the highwall only to the extent that the  regulatory authority deems appropriate and approves as necessary to  facilitate compliance with the provisions of this section. The  regulatory authority may authorize such a disturbance above the highwall  if it finds the disturbance is necessary to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Blend the solid highwall and the backfilled material; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Control surface runoff; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Provide access to the area above the highwall.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Place off the mine bench no more than the amount of spoil  necessary to achieve the postmining land use, ensure the stability of  spoil retained on the bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act  and parts 710 through   725 of this chapter. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be placed  in accordance with the Act and these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The regulatory authority shall review every variance granted  pursuant to this subsection not more than three years from the date of  issuance of the permit to ensure that the proposed alternative  postmining use is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the  approved plan, unless the permittee affirmatively so demonstrates.
