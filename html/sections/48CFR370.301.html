                            <p class="depth0">It is HHS policy that the Contracting Officer shall not award a contract involving human subjects until a prospective contractor has provided acceptable assurance that the activity will be subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) as described in HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103. The Contracting Officer shall require an applicable Federal-wide assurance (FWA), approved by the HHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), of each contractor, subcontractor, or cooperating institution having responsibility for human subjects involved in performance of a contract. OHRP is responsible for negotiating assurances covering all HHS-supported or HHS-conducted activities involving

human subjects. OHRP shall provide guidance to Contracting Officers regarding non-award or termination of a contract due to inadequate assurance or breach of assurance for protection of human subjects.</p>
