                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During this portion of the process, the proponent will invite  comments from all affected parties and respondents to the NOI to assist  in developing issues for detailed discussion in the EIS. Assistance in  identifying possible participants is available from the ODEP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the affected parties identified in paragraph (a)  of this section, participants should include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Technical representatives of the proponent. Such persons must be  able to describe the technical aspects of the proposed action and  alternatives to other participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One or more representatives of any Army-contracted consulting  firm, if one has been retained to participate in writing the EIS or  providing reports that the Army will use to create substantial portions  of the EIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Experts in various environmental disciplines, in any technical  area where foreseen impacts are not already represented among the other  scoping participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In all cases, the participants will be provided with information  developed during the preliminary phase and with as much of the following  information that may be available:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief description of the environment at the affected location.  When descriptions for a specific location are not available, general  descriptions of the probable environmental effects will be provided.  This will also address the extent to which the environment has been  modified or affected in the past.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the proposed alternatives. The description will  be sufficiently detailed to enable evaluation of the range of impacts  that may be caused by the proposed action and alternatives. The amount  of detail that is sufficient will depend on the stage of the development  of the proposal, its magnitude, and its similarity to other actions with  which participants may be familiar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A tentative identification of ``any public environmental  assessments and other environmental impact statements that are being or  will be prepared that are related to but are not part of the scope of  the impact statement under consideration'' (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any additional scoping issues or limitations on the EIS, if not  already described during the preliminary phase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The public involvement should begin with the NOI to publish an  EIS. The NOI may indicate when and where a scoping meeting will take  place and who to contact to receive preliminary information. The scoping  meeting is an informal public meeting, and initiates a continuous  scoping process, allowing the Army to scope the action and the impacts  of alternatives. It is a working session where the gathering and  evaluation of information relating to potential environmental impacts  can be initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Starting with this information (paragraph (d) of this section),  the person conducting the scoping process will use input from any of the  involved or affected parties. This will aid in developing the  conclusions. The proponent determines the final scope of the EIS. If the  proponent chooses not to require detailed treatment of significant  issues or factors in the EIS, in spite of relevant technical or  scientific objections by any participant, the proponent will   clearly identify (in the environmental consequences section of the EIS)  the criteria that were used to eliminate such factors.</p>
