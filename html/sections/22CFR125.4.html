                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following exemptions apply to exports of technical data for which approval is not needed from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The exemptions, except for paragraph (b)(13) of this section, do not apply to exports to proscribed destinations under Sec. 126.1 of this subchapter or for persons considered generally ineligible under Sec. 120.1(c) of this subchapter. The exemptions are also not applicable for purposes of establishing offshore procurement arrangements or producing defense articles offshore (see Sec. 124.13), except as authorized under Sec. 125.4(c). Transmission of classified information must comply with the requirements of the Department of Defense National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (unless such requirements are in direct conflict with guidance provided by the Directorate of Defense Trade controls, in which case the latter guidance must be followed) and the exporter must certify to the transmittal authority that the technical data does not exceed the technical limitation of the authorized export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Technical data, including classified information, to be disclosed pursuant to an official written request or directive from the U.S. Department of Defense;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement approved by the Department of State under part 124 of this subchapter and which meet the requirements of Sec. 124.3 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a contract between the exporter and an agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for the export of the data and such data does not disclose the details of design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of technical data, including classified information, previously authorized for export to the same recipient. Revised copies of such technical data are also exempt if they pertain to the identical defense article, and if the revisions are solely editorial and do not add to the content of technology previously exported or authorized for export to the same recipient;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Technical data, including classified information, in the form of basic operations, maintenance, and training information relating to a defense article lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same recipient. Intermediate or depot-level repair and maintenance information may be exported only under a license or agreement approved specifically for that purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Technical data, including classified information, related to firearms not in excess of caliber .50 and ammunition for such weapons, except detailed design, development, production or manufacturing information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Technical data, including classified information, being returned to the original source of import;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Technical data directly related to classified information which has been previously exported or authorized for export in accordance with this part to the same recipient, and which does not disclose the details of the design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Technical data, including classified information, and regardless of media or format, sent or taken by a U.S. person who is an employee of a U.S. corporation or a U.S. Government agency to a U.S. person employed by that U.S. corporation or to a U.S. Government agency outside the United States. This exemption is subject to the limitations of Sec. 125.1(b) of this subchapter and may be used only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The technical data is to be used outside the United States solely by a U.S. person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The U.S. person outside the United States is an employee of the U.S. Government or is directly employed by the U.S. corporation and not by a foreign subsidiary; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The classified information is sent or taken outside the United States

in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Defense National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (unless such requirements are in direct conflict with guidance provided by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, in which case the latter guidance must be followed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Disclosures of unclassified technical data in the U.S. by U.S. institutions of higher learning to foreign persons who are their bona fide and full time regular employees. This exemption is available only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employee's permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee is not a national of a country to which exports are prohibited pursuant to Sec. 126.1 of this subchapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The institution informs the individual in writing that the technical data may not be transferred to other foreign persons without the prior written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Technical data, including classified information, for which the exporter, pursuant to an arrangement with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy or NASA which requires such exports, has been granted an exemption in writing from the licensing provisions of this part by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Such an exemption will normally be granted only if the arrangement directly implements an international agreement to which the United States is a party and if multiple exports are contemplated. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, in consultation with the relevant U.S. Government agencies, will determine whether the interests of the United States Government are best served by expediting exports under an arrangement through an exemption (see also paragraph (b)(3) of this section for a related exemption);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Technical data which is specifically exempt under part 126 of this subchapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Technical data approved for public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency or Office of Freedom of Information and Security Review. This exemption is applicable to information approved by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency for public release in any form. It does not require that the information be published in order to qualify for the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Defense services and related unclassified technical data are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter, to nationals of NATO countries, Australia, Japan, and Sweden, for the purposes of responding to a written request from the Department of Defense for a quote or bid proposal. Such exports must be pursuant to an official written request or directive from an authorized official of the U.S. Department of Defense. The defense services and technical data are limited to paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section and must not include paragraphs (c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) of this section which follow:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Build-to-Print. ``Build-to-Print'' means that a foreign consignee can produce a defense article from engineering drawings without any technical assistance from a U.S. exporter. This transaction is based strictly on a ``hands-off'' approach since the foreign consignee is understood to have the inherent capability to produce the defense article and only lacks the necessary drawings. Supporting documentation such as acceptance criteria, and specifications, may be released on an as-required basis (i.e. ``must have'') such that the foreign consignee would not be able to produce an acceptable defense article without this additional supporting documentation. Documentation which is not absolutely necessary to permit manufacture of an acceptable defense article (i.e. ``nice to have'') is not considered within the boundaries of a ``Build-to-Print'' data package;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Build/Design-to-Specification. ``Build/Design-to-Specification'' means that a foreign consignee can design and produce a defense article from requirement specifications without any technical assistance from the U.S. exporter. This transaction is based strictly on a ``hands-off'' approach since the foreign consignee is understood to have the inherent capability to both design and produce the defense article and only

lacks the necessary requirement information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Basic Research. ``Basic Research'' means a systemic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. It does not include ``Applied Research'' (i.e. a systemic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met. It is a systematic application of knowledge toward the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Design Methodology, such as: The underlying engineering methods and design philosophy utilized (i.e., the ``why'' or information that explains the rationale for particular design decision, engineering feature, or performance requirement); engineering experience (e.g., lessons learned); and the rationale and associated databases (e.g., design allowables, factors of safety, component life predictions, failure analysis criteria) that establish the operational requirements (e.g., performance, mechanical, electrical, electronic, reliability and maintainability) of a defense article. (Final analytical results and the initial conditions and parameters may be provided.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Engineering Analysis, such as: Analytical methods and tools used to design or evaluate a defense article's performance against the operational requirements. Analytical methods and tools include the development and/or use of mockups, computer models and simulations, and test facilities. (Final analytical results and the initial conditions and parameters may be provided.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Manufacturing Know-how, such as: information that provides detailed manufacturing processes and techniques needed to translate a detailed design into a qualified, finished defense article. (Information may be provided in a build-to-print package that is necessary in order to produce an acceptable defense article.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]
