                                Sec. 1.985-6  Transition rules for a QBU that uses the dollar year beginning in 1987.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section sets forth transition rules for a QBU  that used the dollar approximate separate transactions method of  accounting set forth in Sec. 1.985-3 or Sec. 1.985-3T (as contained in  the April 1, 1989 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 1.1000)) for its  first taxable year beginning in 1987 (DASTM QBU). A DASTM QBU must  determine the dollar and hyperinflationary currency basis of its assets  and the dollar and hyperinflationary currency amount of its liabilities  that were acquired or incurred in taxable years beginning before January  1, 1987. In addition, a DASTM QBU must determine its net worth,  including its retained earnings, at the end of the QBU's last taxable  year beginning before January 1, 1987. This section provides rules for  controlled foreign corporations (as defined in section 957 or section  953(c)(1)(B)), other foreign corporations, and branches of United States  persons that must make these determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basis in assets and amount of liabilities. The hyperinflationary  currency adjusted basis of the QBU's assets and the hyperinflationary  currency amount of the QBU's liabilities acquired or incurred by the QBU  in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, shall be the basis  or the amount as determined under Sec. 1.964-1(e) prior to translation  under Sec. 1.964-1(e)(4). The dollar adjusted basis of such assets and  the dollar   amount of such liabilities shall be the adjusted basis or the amount as  determined under the rules of Sec. 1.964-1(e) after translation under  Sec. 1.964-1(e)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retained earnings. The dollar amount of the QBU's retained  earnings at the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1,  1987, shall be the dollar amount determined under Sec. 1.964-1(e)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All other foreign corporations. If a foreign corporation is a  DASTM QBU that is not described in paragraph (b) of this section, then  the hyperinflationary currency and dollar adjusted basis in the QBU's  assets acquired in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, the  hyperinflationary currency and dollar amount of the QBU's liabilities  acquired or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987,  and the dollar amount of the QBU's net worth, including its retained  earnings, at the end of its last taxable year beginning before January  1, 1987, shall be determined by applying the principles of Sec. 1.985-3T  or Sec. 1.985-3. Thus, for example, the dollar basis of plant and  equipment shall be determined using the appropriate historical exchange  rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pre-1987 section 902 amounts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Translation of pre-1987  section 902 accumulated profits and taxes into United States dollars.  The foreign income taxes and accumulated profits or deficits in  accumulated profits of a foreign corporation that were maintained in  foreign currency for purposes of section 902 and that are attributable  to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1,  1987, shall be translated into dollars at the spot exchange rate on the  first day of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.  Once translated into dollars, these accumulated profits and taxes shall  (absent a change in functional currency) remain in dollars for all  federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carryforward of accumulated deficits in accumulated profits from  pre-1987 taxable years to post-1986 taxable years. For purposes of  sections 902 and 960, the post-1986 undistributed earnings of a foreign  corporation that is subject to the rules of this section shall be  reduced by the dollar amount of the corporation's deficit in accumulated  profits, if any, determined under section 902 and the regulations  thereunder, that was accumulated at the end of the corporation's last  taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987. The dollar amount of the  accumulated deficit shall be determined by multiplying the foreign  currency amount of such deficit by the spot exchange rate on the last  day of the corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1,  1987, and shall be taken into account on the first day of the  corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.  Post-1986 undistributed earnings may not be reduced by the dollar amount  of a pre-1987 deficit in retained earnings determined under Sec. 1.964- 1(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> shall apply. A net worth method of accounting is any  method of accounting under which the taxpayer calculates the taxable  income of a QBU based on the net change in the dollar value of the QBU's  equity (assets minus liabilities) during the course of a taxable year,  taking into account any contributions or remittances made during the  year. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 75-106, 1975-1 C.B. 31. (See  Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basis in assets and amount of liabilities--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hyperinflationary  amounts. For the first taxable year beginning in 1987, the  hyperinflationary currency adjusted basis of a QBU's assets or the  hyperinflationary currency amounts of its liabilities acquired or  incurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987 is the  hyperinflationary currency basis or amount at the date when acquired or  incurred, as adjusted according to United States generally accepted  accounting and tax accounting principles. If a hyperinflationary  currency basis or amount was not determined at such date, the dollar  basis or amount, as adjusted according to United States generally  accepted accounting and tax accounting principles, shall be translated  into hyperinflationary currency at the spot exchange rate on the date  when the   asset or liability was acquired or incurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dollar amounts. For the first taxable year beginning in 1987,  the dollar adjusted basis of the QBU's assets and the amounts of its  liabilities shall be those amounts reflected on the QBU's dollar books  and records at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning  before January 1, 1987, after adjusting the books and records according  to United States generally accepted accounting and tax accounting  principles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ending net worth. The dollar amount of the QBU's net worth at  the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987 shall  equal the QBU's net worth at that date as determined under paragraph  (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Profit and loss branch. If a DASTM QBU is a branch of a United  States person and the QBU used a profit and loss method of accounting  for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, then the  United States person shall first apply the transition rules of  Sec. 1.987-5 in order to determine the beginning amount and dollar basis  of the branch's EQ pool, the hyperinflationary currency basis of the  branch's assets, and the hyperinflationary currency amounts of its  liabilities. A profit and loss method of accounting is any method of  accounting under which the taxpayer calculates the profits of a QBU by  computing the QBU's profits in its functional currency and translating  the net result into dollars. See e.g., Rev. Rul. 75-107, 1975-1 C.B. 32.  (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter). The QBU and the  taxpayer must then make the adjustments required by Sec. 1.985-5, e.g.,  the QBU must take into account unrealized exchange gain or loss on  dollar-denominated section 988 transactions, the taxpayer must account  for the deemed termination of the branch, and the taxpayer must  translate the QBU's balance sheet items from hyperinflationary currency  into dollars at the spot rate.
