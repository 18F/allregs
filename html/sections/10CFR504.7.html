                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of electing powerplants, if OFP finds that it is  technically and financially feasible for a unit to use a mixture of  petroleum or natural gas and an alternate fuel as its primary energy  source, OFP may prohibit, by order, the use in that unit of   petroleum or natural gas, or both, in amounts exceeding the minimum  amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with  maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency of the mixture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and (c) of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section,  OFP may weigh ``physical modification'' or ``derating of the unit,'' but  these considerations, by themselves, will not control the technical  feasibility finding. A technical feasibility finding might be made  notwithstanding the need for substantial physical modification. The  economic consequences of a substantial physical modification are taken  into account in determining financial feasibility.  (Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, Pub.
