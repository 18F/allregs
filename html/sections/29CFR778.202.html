                                Sec. 778.202  Premium pay for hours in excess of a daily or weekly standard.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act as the  weekly maximum, the extra premium compensation paid for the excess hours  is excludable from the regular rate under section 7(e)(5) and may be  credited toward statutory overtime payments pursuant to section 7(h) of  the Act. In applying these rules to situations where it is the custom to  pay employees for hours during which no work is performed due to  vacation, holiday, illness, failure of the employer to provide  sufficient work, or other similar cause, as these terms are explained in  Sec. Sec. 778.216 to 778.224, it is permissible (but not required) to  count these hours as hours worked in determining the amount of overtime  premium pay, due for hours in excess of 8 per day or the applicable  maximum hours standard, which may be excluded from the regular rate and  credited toward the statutory overtime compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hours in excess of normal or regular working hours. Similarly,  where the employee's normal or regular daily or weekly working hours are  greater or less than 8 hours and 40 hours respectively and his contract  provides for the payment of premium rates for work in excess of such  normal or regular hours of work for the day or week (such as 7 in a day  or 35 in a week) the extra compensation provided by such premium rates,  paid for excessive hours, is a true overtime premium to be excluded from  the regular rate and it may be credited toward overtime compensation due  under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Premiums for excessive daily hours. If an employee whose maximum  hours standard is 40 hours is hired at the rate of $5.75 an hour and  receives, as overtime compensation under his contract, $6.25 per hour  for each hour actually worked in excess of 8 per day (or in excess of  his normal or regular daily working hours), his employer may exclude the  premium portion of the overtime rate from the employee's regular rate  and credit the total of the extra 50-cent payments thus made for daily  overtime hours against the overtime compensation which is due under the  statute for hours in excess of 40 in that workweek. If the same contract  further provided for the payment of $6.75 for hours in excess of 12 per  day, the extra $1 payments could likewise be credited toward overtime  compensation due under the Act. To qualify as overtime premiums under  section 7(e)(5), the daily overtime premium payments must be made for  hours in excess of 8 hours per day or the employee's normal or regular  working hours. If the normal workday is artificially divided into a  ``straight time'' period to which one rate is assigned, followed by a  so-called ``overtime'' period for which a higher ``rate'' is specified,  the arrangement will be regarded as a device to contravene the statutory  purposes and the premiums will be considered part of the regular rate.  For a fuller discussion of this problem, see Sec. 778.501.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hours in excess of other statutory standard. Where payment at  premium rates for hours worked in excess of a specified daily or weekly  standard is made pursuant to the requirements of another applicable  statute, the extra compensation provided by such premium rates will be  regarded as a true overtime premium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(6)</em> and 7(h), extra premium compensation paid pursuant to contract  or statute for work on the sixth or seventh day worked in the workweek  is regarded in the same light as premiums paid for work in excess of the  applicable maximum hours standard or the employee's normal or regular  workweek.
