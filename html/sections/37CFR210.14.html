                                Sec.  210.14  Accounting requirements for offsetting phonorecord
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a phonorecord that has been relinquished from  possession for purposes of sale accompanied by a privilege of return, as  described in Sec.  210.12(g)(3), where the phonorecord is returned to  the compulsory licensee for credit or exchange before said compulsory  licensee is considered to have ``voluntarily and permanently parted with  possession'' of the phonorecord as described in Sec.  210.12(g), the  compulsory licensee may use such phonorecord to reduce a ``phonorecord  reserve,'' as defined in Sec.  210.12(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In such cases, the compulsory licensee shall reduce particular  phonorecord reserves by the number of phonorecords that are returned  during the month covered by the Monthly Statement of Account in the  following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the month  covered by the Monthly Statement is smaller than the number comprising  the earliest eligible phonorecord reserve, the compulsory licensee shall  reduce this phonorecord reserve by the total number of returned  phonorecords. Subject to the time limitations in Sec.  210.12(g)(3)(ii),  the number of phonorecords remaining in this reserve shall be available  for use in subsequent months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the month  covered by the Monthly Statement is greater than the number of  phonorecords comprising the earliest eligible phonorecord reserve but  less than the total number of phonorecords comprising all eligible  phonorecord reserves, the compulsory licensee shall first eliminate  those phonorecord reserves, beginning with the earliest eligible  phonorecord reserve, and continuing to the next succeeding phonorecord  reserves, that are completely offset by returned phonorecords. Said  compulsory licensee shall then reduce the next succeeding phonorecord  reserve by the number of returned phonorecords that have not been used  to eliminate a phonorecord reserve. Subject to the time limitations in  Sec.  210.12(g)(3)(ii), the number of phonorecords remaining in this  reserve shall be available for use in subsequent months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the month  covered by the Monthly Statement is equal to or is greater than the  total number of phonorecords comprising all eligible phonorecord  reserves, the compulsory licensee shall eliminate all eligible  phonorecord reserves. Where said number is greater than the total number  of phonorecords comprising all eligible phonorecord reserves, said  compulsory licensee shall establish a ``negative reserve balance,'' as  defined in Sec.  210.12(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except where a negative reserve balance exists, a separate and  distinct phonorecord reserve shall be established for each month during  which the compulsory licensee relinquishes phonorecords from possession  for purposes of sale accompanied by a privilege of return, as described  in Sec.  210.12(g)(3). In accordance with Sec.  210.12(g)(3)(ii), any  phonorecord remaining in a particular phonorecord reserve nine months  from the month in which the particular reserve was established shall be  considered ``distributed''; at that point, the particular monthly  phonorecord reserve shall lapse and royalties for the phonorecords  remaining in it shall be paid as provided in Sec.  210.16(d)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where a negative reserve balance exists, the aggregate total of  phonorecords comprising it shall be accumulated into a single balance  rather than being separated into distinct monthly balances. Following  the establishment of a negative reserve balance, any phonorecords  relinquished from possession by the compulsory licensee for purposes of  sale or otherwise, shall be credited against such negative balance, and  the negative reserve balance shall be reduced accordingly. Digital  phonorecord deliveries may be credited against such negative reserve  balance, but only if such digital phonorecord deliveries have the same  royalty rate as physical phonorecords under part 385 of this title. The  nine-month limit provided in Sec.  210.12(g)(3)(ii) shall have no effect  upon a negative reserve balance; where a negative reserve balance  exists, relinquishment from possession of a phonorecord by the  compulsory licensee at any time shall be used to reduce such balance,  and such phonorecord shall not be considered ``distributed'' within the  meaning of Sec.  210.12(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In no case shall a phonorecord reserve be established while a  negative reserve balance is in existence; conversely, in no case shall a  negative reserve balance be established before all available phonorecord  reserves have been eliminated.</p>
