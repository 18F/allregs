                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coverage. Annexations and deannexations, even of uninhabited  land, are subject to section 5 preclearance to the extent that they  alter or are calculated to alter the composition of a jurisdiction's  electorate. See, e.g., City of Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U.S.  462 (1987). In analyzing annexations and deannexations under section 5,  the Attorney General considers the purpose and effect of the annexations  and deannexations only as they pertain to voting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 5 review. It is the practice of the Attorney General to  review all of a jurisdiction's unprecleared annexations and  deannexations together. See City of Pleasant Grove v. United States,  C.A. No. 80-2589 (D.D.C. Oct. 7, 1981).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relevant factors. In making determinations with respect to  annexations, the Attorney General, in addition to the factors described  above, will consider the following factors (among others):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which a jurisdiction's annexations reflect the  purpose or have the effect of excluding minorities while including other  similarly situated persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the annexations reduce a jurisdiction's  minority population percentage, either at the time of the submission or,  in view of the intended use, for the reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the electoral system to be used in the jurisdiction  fails fairly to reflect minority voting strength as it exists in the  post-annexation jurisdiction. See City of Richmond v. United States, 422  U.S. 358, 367-72 (1975).  [52 FR 490, Jan. 6, 1987; 52 FR 2648, Jan. 23, 1987, as amended by Order  3262-2011, 76 FR 21249, Apr. 15, 2011]</p>
