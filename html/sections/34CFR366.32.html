For purposes of this paragraph, an assistance contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to transfer funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act and this part to an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the Act. Under an assistance contract, the DSU shall assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section 722 of the Act. If the DSU uses an assistance contract to award funds under section 723 of the Act, the DSU may not add any requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance contract were a grant rather than an assistance contract. Under an assistance contract, as defined in this paragraph, the role of the DSU is to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract, which are established by chapter 1 of title VII of the Act and the implementing regulations in this part and 34 CFR part 364, are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director may not enter into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes of this paragraph, a procurement contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of an assistance contract, the DSU shall follow the procedures established in Secs. 366.40 through 366.45.
