The importation of swine casings that originated in or were processed in a region where African swine fever exists, as listed under Sec. 94.8(a) of this subchapter, is prohibited, with the following exception: Swine casings that are processed in a region where African swine fever exists may be imported into the United States under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Origin of casings. The swine casings were derived from swine raised and slaughtered in a region not listed under Sec. 94.8(a) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shipping requirements. The casings were shipped from the region of origin to a processing establishment in a region listed under Sec. 94.8(a) of this subchapter in a closed container sealed with serially numbered seals applied by an official of the national government of the region of origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Origin certificate. The casings were accompanied from the region of origin to the processing establishment by a certificate written in English and signed by an official of the national government of the region of origin specifying the region of origin, the processing establishment to which the swine casings were consigned, and the numbers of the seals applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Integrity of seals. The casings were taken out of the container at the processing establishment only after an official of the national government of the region where the processing establishment is located determined that the seals were intact and free of any evidence of tampering and had so stated on the certificate referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The processing establishment. The casings were processed at a single processing establishment \1\ in a region listed under Sec. 94.8(a) of this subchapter. The processing establishment does not receive or process any live swine and uses

only pork and pork products that originate in a region not listed under Sec. 94.8(a) of this subchapter and that are shipped to the processing establishment in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ As a condition of entry into the United States, pork or pork products must also meet all of the requirements of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and regulations under the Act (9 CFR, chapter III, part 327), including requirements that the pork or pork products be prepared only in approved establishments.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Compliance agreement.

If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons will be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal should state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of Practice governing such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Export certification.
