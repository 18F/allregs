However, data contained within the unsolicited proposal may need to be disclosed as a result of a request submitted pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Because of this possibility, the Contracting Officer shall provide the following notice to all prospective offerors of unsolicited proposals:</p><p class="depth0">``The Government will attempt to comply with the ``Use and Disclosure of Data'' legend. However, the Government may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) or deny access to a record requested by an individual (the public) when an obligation is imposed on the Government under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The Government determination to withhold or disclose a record will be based upon the particular circumstances surrounding the record and on whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Per FAR 15.609(e), the offeror should identify any records that it considers to be trade secrets, commercial or financial information, and privileged or confidential information.''</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 315.70_Acquisition of Electronic Information Technology</p>
