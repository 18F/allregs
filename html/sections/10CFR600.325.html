                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the policies with regard to  disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first  actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or  cooperative agreement with DOE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Patents right--small business concerns. In accordance with 35  U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a  grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research,  developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are  ``exceptional circumstances'' as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the  award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart,  entitled ``Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit  Organizations'' which provides to the recipient the right to elect  ownership of inventions made under the award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em>  of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other  than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and  receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and  demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must  contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled  ``Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)--No Waiver'' which provides that  DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Patent Waiver Granted. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not  apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR  part 784;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver  under 10 CFR part 784; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime  award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special Provision. Normally, an award will not include a  background patent and data provision. However, under special  circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of  commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require  licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data  and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a  background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization  will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program  official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include  the right to license the Government and third party contractors for  special Government purposes when future availability of the technology  would also benefit the government, e.g., clean-up of DOE facilities. The  scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is  subject to negotiation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rights in data--general rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to paragraphs (d)(2)  and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs  (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart  must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled  ``Rights in Data--General''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited  rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting  officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program  official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted  computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after  negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard  clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to  this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other  special circumstances exist, e.g., DOE specifying ``open-source''  treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation  with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions  requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting  officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the  retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright  provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rights in data--programs covered under special protected data  statutes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a statute, other than those providing for the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology  Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time,  typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award  for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from  public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award  the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled ``Rights in  Data--Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes'' or, as  determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program  official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or  categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rights in data--SBIR/STTR programs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If an applicant receives  an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer  must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms  and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled ``Rights in Data--SBIR  Program''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The data rights provisions for SBIR/STTR grants are contained in  the award terms and conditions for SBIR grants located at http://e- center.doe.gov on the Professionals Homepage under Financial Assistance,  Regulations and Guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Authorization and consent. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Work performed by a recipient  under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of  a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent  infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is  subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention  consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel,  may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other  patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent  indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance  regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses  for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those  in 48 CFR part 927.</p><p class="depth0">Procurement Standards</p>
