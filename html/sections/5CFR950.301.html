                                Sec. 950.301  Federation eligibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director may recognize federations that conform to the  requirements set by the Director and are eligible to receive  designations. In order to determine whether the Director will recognize  a federation, the Director may request evidence of corrective action  regarding any prior violation of regulation or directive, sanction, or  penalty, as appropriate. The Director retains the ultimate authority to  decide whether the federation has demonstrated, to the Director's  satisfaction, that the federation has taken appropriate corrective  action. Failure to demonstrate satisfactory corrective action or to  respond to the Director's request for information within 10 business  days of the date of the request may result in a determination that the  federation will not be included in the Charity List. The Director also  reserves the authority to place a moratorium on the recognition of  federations from time to time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By applying for inclusion in the CFC, federations consent to  allow the Director complete access to its and its members' CFC books and  records and to respond to requests for information by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An organization may apply to the Director for inclusion as a  federation to participate in the CFC if the applicant has, as members of  the proposed federation, 15 or more charitable organizations, in  addition to the federation itself, that meet the eligibility criteria of  Sec. Sec. 950.202 and 950.203. The federation must submit the  applications of all its proposed member organizations annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After an organization has been granted federation status, it may  certify that its member organizations meet all eligibility criteria of  Sec. 950.202 and Sec. 950.203 to be included on the Charity List.  Federation status in a prior campaign is not a guarantee of federation  status in a subsequent campaign. Failure to meet minimum federation  eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of  federation status subject to a hearing on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An applicant for federation status must annually certify and/or  demonstrate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That all member organizations seeking participation in the CFC  are qualified for inclusion on the National/International or  International or Local part of the Charity List. Applicants must provide  a complete list of those member organizations it certified in addition  to each organization's complete application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That it meets the eligibility requirements and public  accountability standards contained in Sec. 950.202 and Sec. 950.203.  The federation can demonstrate that it has met the eligibility  requirement in Sec. 950.202(a) either through its own services,  benefits, assistance or program activities or through its 15 members'  activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The federation must complete the certification set forth at  Sec. 950.203(a)(2) without regard to the amount of revenue reported on  its IRS Form 990 and must provide a copy of its audited financial  statements. The audited financial statements provided must verify that  the federation is honoring designations   made to each member organization by distributing a proportionate share  of receipts based on donor designations to each member. The audit  requirement is waived for newly created federations operating for less  than two years from the date of its IRS tax-exemption letter to the  closing date of the CFC application period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The federation must provide a listing of its board of  directors, beginning and ending dates of each member's current term of  office, and the board's meeting dates and locations for the calendar  year prior to the year of the campaign for which the organization is  applying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That it does not employ in its CFC operations the services of  private consultants, consulting firms, advertising agencies or similar  business organizations to perform its policy-making or decision-making  functions in the CFC. It may, however, contract with entities or  individuals such as banks, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of  goods and/or services to assist in accomplishing its administrative  tasks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director will notify a federation if it is determined that  the federation does not meet the eligibility requirements of this  section. A federation may appeal an adverse eligibility decision in  accordance with Sec. 950.204.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Director may waive any eligibility criteria for federation  status if it is determined that such a waiver will be in the best  interest of the CFC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Two organizations--American Red Cross and United Service  Organization--are exempt from the 15- member requirement of paragraph  (c) of this section.</p>
