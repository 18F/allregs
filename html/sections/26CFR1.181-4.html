The requirements  of this paragraph (a) apply notwithstanding whether an owner has  satisfied the revocation requirements of Sec. 1.181-2(d). An owner that  claimed a deduction under section 181 for a production in any taxable  year in an amount in excess of the amount that would be allowable as a  deduction for that year in the absence of section 181 must recapture the  excess amount as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for  the production in the first taxable year for which--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For any pre-amendment production, the aggregate production costs  of the production exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit  under Sec. 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For any pre-amendment production, the owner no longer reasonably  expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the  current taxable year) that the aggregate production costs of the  production will not, at any time, exceed the applicable aggregate  production costs limit set forth under Sec. 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The owner no longer reasonably expects (based on all of the  facts and circumstances at the end of the current taxable year) either  that the production will be set for production or that the production  will be a qualified film or television production; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The owner revokes the election pursuant to Sec. 1.181-2(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. An owner that claimed a deduction under section  181 and disposes of the production prior to its initial release or  broadcast must recapture the entire amount specified   under paragraph (a)(3) of this section in the year the owner disposes of  the production before computing gain or loss from the disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Principal photography not commencing prior to the date of  expiration of section 181. If an owner claims a deduction under section  181 for a production for which principal photography does not commence  prior to the date of expiration of section 181, the owner must recapture  deductions as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section in the  owner's taxable year that includes the date of expiration of section  181.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of recapture. An owner subject to the recapture  requirements under this section must, for the taxable year in which  recapture is required, include in the owner's gross income as ordinary  income and add to the owner's adjusted basis in the property--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a production that is placed in service in a taxable year  prior to the taxable year for which recapture is required, the  difference between the aggregate amount the owner claimed as a deduction  under section 181 for the production for all such prior taxable years  and the aggregate depreciation deductions that would have been allowable  for the production for such prior taxable years (or that the owner could  have elected to deduct in the taxable year that the production was  placed in service) for the production under the owner's method of  accounting; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a production that has not been placed in service, the  aggregate amount claimed as a deduction under section 181 for the  production for all such prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recapture under section 1245. For purposes of recapture under  section 1245, any deduction allowed under section 181 is treated as a  deduction allowable for amortization.  [T.D. 9551, 76 FR 60728, Sept. 30, 2011]</p>
