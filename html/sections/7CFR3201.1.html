                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the guidelines in this part is to assist  procuring agencies in complying with the requirements of section 9002 of  the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA), Public Law  107-171, 116 Stat. 476 (7 U.S.C. 8102), as amended by the Food,  Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Public Law 110-246, 122 Stat.  1651, as they apply to the procurement of the products designated in  subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The guidelines in this part establish a process for  designating categories of products that are, or can be, produced with  biobased components and materials and whose procurement by procuring  agencies and other relevant stakeholders will carry out the objectives  of section 9002 of FSRIA. The guidelines also establish a process for  designating categories of intermediate ingredients and feedstocks that  are, or can be, used to produce final products that will be designated  and, thus, subject to Federal preferred procurement. The guidelines also  establish a process for calculating the biobased content of complex  assembly products, whose biobased content cannot be measured following  ASTM   Standard Method D6866, and for designating complex assembly product  categories.
