                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A residential lease of tribal land may provide either or both parties with negotiated remedies in the event of a lease violation, including, but not limited to, the power to terminate the lease. If the lease provides one or both parties with the power to terminate the lease:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> BIA approval of the termination is not required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The termination is effective without BIA cancellation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Indian landowners must notify us of the termination so that we may record it in the LTRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A residential lease of individually owned Indian land may provide either or both parties with negotiated remedies, so long as the lease also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests under Sec. 162.012 of this part. If the lease provides one or both parties with the power to terminate the lease:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> BIA concurrence with the termination is required to ensure that the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests have consented; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BIA will record the termination in the LTRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The parties must notify any mortgagee of any violation that may result in termination and the termination of a residential lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Negotiated remedies may apply in addition to, or instead of, the cancellation remedy available to us, as specified in the lease.

We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing actions or proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us.
