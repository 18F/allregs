                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of taxable income. Section 863(b) provides an alternate method for determining taxable income from sources within the United States in the case of gross income derived from sources partly within and partly without the United States. Under this method, taxable income is determined by deducting from such gross income the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto and a ratable part of any other expenses, losses, or deductions that cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income. The income to which this section applies (and that is treated as derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States) will consist of gains, profits, and income</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From certain transportation or other services rendered partly within and partly without the United States to the extent not within the scope of section 863(c) or other specific provisions of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the sale of inventory property (within the meaning of section 865(i)) produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer in the United States and sold outside the United States or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer outside the United States and sold in the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States, to the extent not excluded from the scope of these regulations under Sec. 1.936-6(a)(5),
Q&A; 7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of source of taxable income. Income treated as derived from sources partly within and partly without the United States under paragraph (a) of this section may be allocated to sources within and without the United States pursuant to Sec. 1.863-1 or apportioned to such sources in accordance with the methods described in other regulations under section 863. To determine the source of certain types of income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, see Sec. 1.863-4. To determine the source of gross income described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, see Sec. 1.863-1 for natural resources and see Sec. 1.863-3 for other inventory. Taxpayers, at their election, may apply the principles of Sec. 1.863-3 (b)(1) and (c) to determine the source of taxable income (rather than gross income) from sales of inventory property (other than natural resources). To determine the source of income partly from sources within a possession of the United States, including income described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, see Sec. 1.863-3(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective dates. This section will apply to taxable years beginning after December 30, 1996. However, taxpayers may apply the rules of this section for taxable years beginning after July 11, 1995, and on or before December 30, 1996. For years beginning before December 30, 1996, see Sec. 1.863-2 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 1996).
