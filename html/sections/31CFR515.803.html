Each copy of any such  entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document, including the  additional copy, shall bear plainly on its face the number of the  license pursuant to which it is filed. The original copy of the specific  license shall be presented to the collector in respect of   each such transaction and shall bear a notation in ink by the licensee  or person presenting the license showing the description, quantity and  value of the merchandise to be entered, withdrawn or otherwise dealt  with. This notation should be so placed and so written that there will  exist no possibility of confusing it with anything placed on the license  at the time of its issuance.

Each copy of the entry, withdrawal, or  other appropriate document, including the additional copy, shall bear  plainly on its face the following statement: ``This document is  presented under the provisions of Sec. 515.536 (c) of the Cuban Assets  Control Regulations.'' The original of the certificate of origin shall  not be returned to the person presenting it. It shall be securely  attached to the additional copy required by this subparagraph and shall  be forwarded by the collector to the Office of Foreign Assets Control,  Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220.

In  addition, the collector shall endorse his pertinent records so as to  record what merchandise is covered by the appropriate certificate of  origin presented. The collector may thereafter allow subsequent  authorized transactions on presentation of the certificate of origin.  The collector shall, with respect to each such transaction, demand an  additional copy of each withdrawal or other appropriate document, which  copy shall be promptly forwarded by the collector to the Office of  Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220, with  an endorsement thereon reading:</p><p class="depth3">This document has been accepted pursuant to Sec. 515.808(c) (2) of  the Cuban Assets Control Regulations.
