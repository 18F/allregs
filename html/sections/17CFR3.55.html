Such written submission must be served upon the  Division of Enforcement and filed with the Proceedings Clerk within  twenty days of the date of service of notice to the registrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reply. Within ten days of receipt of any written submission  filed by the   registrant, the Division of Enforcement may serve upon the registrant  and file with the Proceedings Clerk a reply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination by Administrative Law Judge. A determination by  the Administrative Law Judge as to whether the registrant is subject to  a statutory disqualification must be based upon the evidence of the  statutory disqualification, notice with proof of service, the written  submission, if any, filed by the registrant in response thereto, any  written reply submitted by the Division of Enforcement and such other  papers as the Administrative Law Judge may require or permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Suspension and order to show cause. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the registrant is  found to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the Administrative  Law Judge, within thirty days after receipt of the registrant's written  submission, if any, and any reply thereto, shall issue an interim order  suspending the registration of the registrant and requiring the  registrant to show cause within twenty days of the date of the order  why, notwithstanding the existence of the statutory disqualification,  the registration of the registrant should not be revoked. The  registration of the registrant shall be suspended, effective five days  after the order to show cause is served upon the registrant in  accordance with Sec. 3.50(a), until a final order with respect to the  order to show cause has been issued: Provided, That if the sole basis  upon which the registrant is subject to statutory disqualification is  the existence of a temporary order, judgment or decree of the type  described in section 8a(2)(C) of the Act, the order to show cause shall  not be issued and the registrant shall be suspended until such time as  the temporary order, judgment or decree shall have expired: Provided,  however, That in no event shall the registrant be suspended for a period  to exceed six months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Further proceedings. If an order to show cause is issued  pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, further proceedings on  such order shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  3.60(b)-(j) of this part.
