manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens required to be maintained regarding studies to which this part applies. The records inspection and copying requirements shall not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and problems, or to actions recommended and taken, except the EPA may seek production of these records in litigation or formal adjudicatory hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a chemical substance or mixture does not present a risk of injury to health or the environment any data developed by a testing facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in accordance with this part. The determination that a study will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Since a testing facility is a place where chemicals are stored or held, it is subject to inspection under section 11 of TSCA.</p>
