Among the forms that such copies can take are paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk).</p><p class="depth0">Records, information, document, and material have the same meaning as the term agency records in section 552 of title 5, United States Code.</p><p class="depth0">Review means the process of initially examining documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of any document located may be withheld. It also includes processing documents for disclosure; e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal and policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Search means the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents.
