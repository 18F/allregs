Delegations by the Secretary of Transportation to Secretarial Officers and the Director, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of functions under Subparts I, II, and IV of the Statute appear in 49 CFR part 1. This part also sets forth the procedures governing discretionary review by the appropriate Reviewing Official of action taken under such assignments. Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding the Department from issuing, by appropriate order, temporary delegations of authority with respect to any functions described in this part or with respect to any other functions which can be lawfully delegated.
