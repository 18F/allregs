This determination will be made by the NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An on-site determination as to whether an area meets the applicable criteria shall be made by an NRCS representative if the person has disagreed with the determination made under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, or if adequate information is not otherwise available to an NRCS representative on which to make an off-site determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> An on-site determination, where applicable, will be made by the NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a determination, but only when site conditions are

favorable for the evaluation of soils, hydrology, or vegetation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> With regard to wetland determinations, if an area is continuously inundated or saturated for long periods of time during the growing season to such an extent that access by foot to make a determination of predominance of hydric soils or prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation is not feasible, the area will be determined to be a wetland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Persons who are adversely affected by a determination made under this section and believe that the requirements of this part were improperly applied may appeal, under Sec.  12.12 of this part, any determination by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> NRCS will operate a program or work with third parties to establish mitigation banks to assist persons in complying with Sec.

The provisions of this part that are applicable to RMA will be administered under the general supervision of the Administrator, RMA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies will be based on the person's:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accurate and timely filing of a certification of compliance (Form AD-1026 or successor form) with the conservation compliance provisions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compliance with the conservation compliance provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies due to violations of the conservation compliance provisions will be based on final determinations, including all administrative appeals, made by NRCS and FSA as provided in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neither RMA nor FCIC will make any determination of eligibility regarding compliance with the highly erodible land or wetland provisions in this part, unless specifically provided for in Sec.  12.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> RMA will provide the applicable information regarding determinations made by NRCS and FSA to the appropriate approved insurance providers to ensure those determinations affecting Federal crop insurance premium subsidy eligibility are implemented according to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Approved insurance providers.
