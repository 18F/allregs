If multiple purchase orders  are needed to assist community members of a particular RAB or TRC, the  combined sum of these purchase orders cannot exceed $100,000 or, during  any one year, the lesser of $25,000 or 1 percent of the installation's  total projected environmental restoration cost-to-complete. Note that  these limitations refer to the maximum allowable technical assistance  funding per RAB/TRC. Resources available within a given year may vary.  These limitations apply unless a waiver is granted by the DoD Component  Secretary or equivalent for the installation in question. The $100,000  total and $25,000 annual limitations may be waived, as appropriate, to  reflect the complexity of response action, the nature and extent of  contamination at the installation, the level of activity at the  installation, projected total needs as identified by the TAPP recipient,  the size and diversity of the affected population, and the ability of  the TAPP recipient to identify and raise funds from other sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Community members of the RAB/TRC will provide a description of  the services requested (TAPP Project Description) and, if desired, the  names of one or more proposed technical assistance providers to the DoD  RAB Co-Chair, who will ensure the application is submitted to the  installation commander or other designated authority and to the  appropriate DoD contracting office. Technical assistance providers  proposed by the community members of a RAB or TRC at each DoD  installation that meets the minimum set of organizational qualifications  guidelines provided by the Department of Defense in Sec. 203.12 of this  part will be added to the governments list of bidders for the proposed  procurement.</p>
