                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary has determined that the rules and standards of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation governing the holding of government securities in a fiduciary capacity by depository institutions subject thereto are adequate. Accordingly, such depository institutions are exempt from this part with respect to their holdings of government securities in a fiduciary capacity and their holdings of government securities in a custodial capacity provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such institution has adopted policies and procedures that would apply to such custodial holdings all the requirements imposed by its appropriate regulatory agency that are applicable to government securities held in a fiduciary capacity, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such custodial holdings are subject to examination by the appropriate regulatory agency for compliance with such fiduciary requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary expects that each appropriate regulatory agency will notify the Department if it materially revises its rules and standards governing the holding of government securities in a fiduciary capacity.
