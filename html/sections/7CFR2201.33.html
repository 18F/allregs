Payment shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank and account designated by the Agent or Lender for such purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Board may take, or direct to be taken any action in liquidating the Collateral that the Board determines to be necessary or proper, consistent with Federal law and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pursuant to the Guarantee, upon Payment Demand by the Agent or Lender, and whether the Board has approved any payment under the Guarantee or any payment has been made under the Guarantee, the Board, through the Administrator, shall have the right to liquidate, or cause to be liquidated, the Collateral.
