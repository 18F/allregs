                            <p class="depth0">In labels, fact sheets, ads, or other promotional materials, do not  give the R-value for one inch or the ``R-value per inch'' of your  product. There are two exceptions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an outstanding FTC Cease and Desist Order applies to you but  differs from the rules given here, you can petition to amend the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You can do this if actual test results prove that the R-values  per inch of your product does not drop as it gets thicker.  You can list a range of R-value per inch. If you do, you must say  exactly how much the R-value drops with greater thickness. You must also  add this statement: ``The R-value per inch of this insulation varies  with thickness. The thicker the insulation, the lower the R-value per  inch.''
