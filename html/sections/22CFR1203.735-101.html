The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of Government employees and special Government employees through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards. To accord with these concepts the regulations in this part prescribe standards of conduct and responsibilities for employees and special Government employees and require statements reporting employment and financial interests.</p><p class="depth0">Note: These regulations are codified in State 3 FAM 620, AID Handbook 24, and ICA MOA V-A 550.</p>
