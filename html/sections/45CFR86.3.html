In the absence of a finding of discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limited participation therein by persons of a particular sex.

Each recipient education institution shall, within one year of the effective date of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evaluate, in terms of the requirements of this part, its current policies and practices and the effects thereof concerning admission of students, treatment of students, and employment of both academic and non-academic personnel working in connection

with the recipient's education program or activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modify any of these policies and practices which do not or may not meet the requirements of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any discrimination which resulted or may have resulted from adherence to these policies and practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Availability of self-evaluation and related materials. Recipients shall maintain on file for at least three years following completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall provide to the Director upon request, a description of any modifications made pursuant to paragraph (c) (2) of this section and of any remedial steps taken pursuant to paragraph (c) (3) of this section.
