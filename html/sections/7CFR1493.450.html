                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CCC's obligation. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that the importer fails to pay under the importer obligation. unless CCC determines with respect to the particular transaction and claim that the guaranteed portion of the port value exceeded the prevailing U.S. market value for the same, or same type of agricultural commodity or product. In making this determination, CCC will adjust the prevailing U.S. market value for estimated freight and/or insurance costs if the export sale was made on a CFR or CIF basis. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Period of guarantee coverage. The payment guarantee will apply to a credit period not exceeding 180 days beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or from the date when interest begins to accrue whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural commodities or products thereof specified in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terms of the CCC payment guarantee. The terms of CCC's coverage will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final date to export. The final date to export shown on the payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the contractual deadline for shipping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reserve coverage for loading tolerances. The exporter may apply for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ineligible exports. Commodities with a date of export prior to the date

of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof, are ineligible for guarantee coverage under this subpart, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Foreign agricultural component. CCC may approve payment guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United States agricultural commodities as defined in Sec. 1493.410(x). CCC may not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for the value of any foreign agricultural component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional requirements. The payment guarantee may contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the exporter or the exporter's assignee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Amendments. A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as amendments.)</p>
