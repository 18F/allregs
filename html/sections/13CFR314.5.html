For example, if the total Project costs are $100, consisting of $50 of Investment Assistance and $50 of Matching Share, the Federal Share is 50 percent. If the Property is disposed of when its current fair market is $250, the Federal Share is $125 (i.e., 50 percent of $250). If $10 is spent to put the Property into salable condition, the Federal Share is $120 (i.e., 50 percent of ($250-$10)).</p>
