                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An administrative hearing for a conductor certification petition  shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who can be any person  authorized by the Administrator, including an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The presiding officer may exercise the powers of the  Administrator to regulate the conduct of the hearing for the purpose of  achieving a prompt and fair determination of all material issues in  controversy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The presiding officer shall convene and preside over the  hearing. The hearing shall be a de novo hearing to find the relevant  facts and determine the correct application of this part to those facts.  The presiding officer may determine that there is no genuine issue  covering some or all material facts and limit evidentiary proceedings to  any issues of material fact as to which there is a genuine dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The presiding officer may authorize discovery of the types and  quantities which in the presiding officer's discretion will contribute  to a fair   hearing without unduly burdening the parties. The presiding officer may  impose appropriate non-monetary sanctions, including limitations as to  the presentation of evidence and issues, for any party's willful failure  or refusal to comply with approved discovery requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Every petition, motion, response, or other authorized or  required document shall be signed by the party filing the same, or by a  duly authorized officer or representative of record, or by any other  person. If signed by such other person, the reason therefor must be  stated and the power of attorney or other authority authorizing such  other person to subscribe the document must be filed with the document.  The signature of the person subscribing any document constitutes a  certification that he or she has read the document; that to the best of  his or her knowledge, information and belief every statement contained  in the document is true and no such statements are misleading; and that  it is not interposed for delay or to be vexatious.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After the request for a hearing is filed, all documents filed or  served upon one party must be served upon all parties. Each party may  designate a person upon whom service is to be made when not specified by  law, regulation, or directive of the presiding officer. If a party does  not designate a person upon whom service is to be made, then service may  be made upon any person having subscribed to a submission of the party  being served, unless otherwise specified by law, regulation, or  directive of the presiding officer. Proof of service shall accompany all  documents when they are tendered for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If any document initiating, filed, or served in, a proceeding is  not in substantial compliance with the applicable law, regulation, or  directive of the presiding officer, the presiding officer may strike or  dismiss all or part of such document, or require its amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or  by an authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Any person testifying at a hearing or deposition may be  accompanied, represented, and advised by an attorney or other  representative, and may be examined by that person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Any party may request to consolidate or separate the hearing of  two or more petitions by motion to the presiding officer, when they  arise from the same or similar facts or when the matters are for any  reason deemed more efficiently heard together.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 242.507(c) and paragraph (u)(4) of  this section, whenever a party has the right or is required to take  action within a period prescribed by this part, or by law, regulation,  or directive of the presiding officer, the presiding officer may extend  such period, with or without notice, for good cause, provided another  party is not substantially prejudiced by such extension. A request to  extend a period which has already expired may be denied as untimely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> An application to the presiding officer for an order or ruling  not otherwise specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion.  The motion shall be filed with the presiding officer and, if written,  served upon all parties. All motions, unless made during the hearing,  shall be written. Motions made during hearings may be made orally on the  record, except that the presiding officer may direct that any oral  motion be reduced to writing. Any motion shall state with particularity  the grounds therefor and the relief or order sought, and shall be  accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied  upon which is not already part of the record. Any matter submitted in  response to a written motion must be filed and served within fourteen  (14) days of the motion, or within such other period as directed by the  presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Testimony by witnesses at the hearing shall be given under oath  and the hearing shall be recorded verbatim. The presiding officer shall  give the parties to the proceeding adequate opportunity during the  course of the hearing for the presentation of arguments in support of or  in opposition to motions, and objections and exceptions to rulings of  the presiding officer. The presiding officer may permit oral argument on  any issues for which the presiding officer deems it appropriate and  beneficial. Any evidence or argument   received or proffered orally shall be transcribed and made a part of the  record. Any physical evidence or written argument received or proffered  shall be made a part of the record, except that the presiding officer  may authorize the substitution of copies, photographs, or descriptions,  when deemed to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The presiding officer shall employ the Federal Rules of Evidence  for United States Courts and Magistrates as general guidelines for the  introduction of evidence. Notwithstanding paragraph (m) of this section,  all relevant and probative evidence shall be received unless the  presiding officer determines the evidence to be unduly repetitive or so  extensive and lacking in relevancy that its admission would impair the  prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The presiding officer may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issue subpoenas as provided for in Sec. 209.7 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adopt any needed procedures for the submission of evidence in  written form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examine witnesses at the hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of the  hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the  provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the  hearing or aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The petitioner before the Operating Crew Review Board, the  railroad involved in taking the certification action, and FRA shall be  parties at the hearing. All parties may participate in the hearing and  may appear and be heard on their own behalf or through designated  representatives. All parties may offer relevant evidence, including  testimony, and may conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be  required to make a record of the relevant facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The party requesting the administrative hearing shall be the  ``hearing petitioner.'' The hearing petitioner shall have the burden of  proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Hence, if the  hearing petitioner is the railroad involved in taking the certification  action, that railroad will have the burden of proving that its decision  to deny certification, deny recertification, or revoke certification was  correct. Conversely, if the petitioner before the Operating Crew Review  Board is the hearing petitioner, that person will have the burden of  proving that the railroad's decision to deny certification, deny  recertification, or revoke certification was incorrect. The party who is  not the hearing petitioner will be a respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> FRA will be a mandatory party to the administrative hearing. At  the start of each proceeding, FRA will be a respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The record in the proceeding shall be closed at the conclusion  of the evidentiary hearing unless the presiding officer allows  additional time for the submission of additional evidence. In such  instances the record shall be left open for such time as the presiding  officer grants for that purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> At the close of the record, the presiding officer shall prepare  a written decision in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> The decision:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law, as  well as the basis for each concerning all material issues of fact or law  presented on the record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall be served on the hearing petitioner and all other parties  to the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shall not become final for 35 days after issuance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Constitutes final agency action unless an aggrieved party files  an appeal within 35 days after issuance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Is not precedential.</p>
