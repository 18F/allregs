                            <p class="depth0">Polyarylate resins (CAS Reg. No. 51706-10-6) may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for use in contact with food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. Polyarylate resins (1, 3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diphenyl ester, polymer with diphenyl 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and 4-4'-(1-methylethylidine) bis(phenol)) are formed by melt polycondensation of bisphenol-A with diphenylisophthalate and diphenylterephthalate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. (1) The finished copolymers shall contain from 70 to 80 weight percent of polymer units derived from diphenylisophthalate and 20 to 30 weight percent of polymer units derived from diphenylterephthalate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The finished copolymers shall contain from 70 to 80 weight percent of polymer units derived from diphenylisophthalate and 20 to 30 weight percent of polymer units derived from diphenylterephthalate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Polyarylate resins shall have a minimum weight average molecular weight of 20,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Polyarylate resins may be identified by their characteristic infrared spectra.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extractive limitations. The finished polyarylate resins in sheet form at least 0.5 millimeter (0.020 inch) thick, when extracted with water at 121 C (250 F) for 2 hours, shall yield total nonvolatile extractives not to exceed 2.33 micrograms per square centimeter (15 micrograms per square inch) of the exposed resin surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations. Polyarylate resin articles may be used in contact with all foods except beverages containing more than 8 volume percent ethanol under conditions of use A through H, described in table 2 of Sec. 176.170(c) of this chapter.
