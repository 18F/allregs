                            <p class="depth0">Where an error in computation of the quantity of tobacco products or in computation of the amount of tax due results in an overpayment and such error is specifically identified and supported by records, the manufacturer may file claim for refund or may make an adjustment in his semimonthly tax return as provided in Sec. 40.164. (Section 6511, 26 U.S.C., provides that, in most cases, any adjustment of claim for refund of an overpayment of tax on tobacco products must be made or filed within three years after the tax is paid.) If the manufacturer elects to file a claim for refund of an overpayment resulting from such a computational error, he shall do so on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. The original shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer, and the duplicate retained by the manufacturer. Where an overpayment of tax on tobacco products results from other than a computational error any claim for refund or credit shall be made in accordance with subpart A of part 46 of this chapter.
