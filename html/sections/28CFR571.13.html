Bureau  staff are to encourage the inmate to give at least one employment lead  or contact. Where the inmate or the inmate's family has already  identified employment, the case manager shall notify the United States  Probation Officer so that the usual verification of release plans may be  made. Where employment has not been identified, the case manager shall  notify the United States Probation Officer of the employment need. This  notification should ordinarily occur at least six weeks prior to the  inmate's release.</p>
