                                Sec. 1.1445-8  Special rules regarding publicly traded partnerships,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Entities to which this section applies. The rules of this section apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any partnership or trust, interests in which are regularly traded on an established securities market (regardless of the number of its partners or beneficiaries), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any REIT (regardless of the form of its organization).
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the rules of section 1445 (e)(1) and this section shall not apply to a publicly traded partnership (as defined in section 7704) which is treated as a corporation under section 7704(a), or to those entities that are classified as ``associations'' and taxed as corporations. See Sec. 301.7701-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Obligation to withhold--(1) In general. An entity described in paragraph (a) of this section is not required to withhold under the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-5(c), which states the withholding requirements of domestic partnerships, trusts and estates upon the disposition of U.S. real property interests. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be liable to withhold tax upon the distribution of any amount attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest, with respect to each holder of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person. The amount to be withhold is described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An entity described in paragraph (a) of this section is not required to withhold under the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-5(c), which states the withholding requirements of domestic partnerships, trusts and estates upon the disposition of U.S. real property interests. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be liable to withhold tax upon the distribution of any amount attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest, with respect to each holder of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person. The amount to be withhold is described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Publicly traded partnerships. Publicly traded partnerships which comply with the withholding procedures under section 1446 will be deemed to have satisfied their withholding obligations under this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain distributions to nominees. In the case of a person that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a nominee (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Receives a distribution attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest directly from an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section or indirectly from such entity through a nominee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Receives the distribution for payment to any foreign person, or the account of any foreign person, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Receives a qualified notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section,
then the obligation to withhold in accordance with the general rules of section 1445(e)(1) and this paragraph (b) shall be imposed solely on that person to the extent of the amount specified by the qualified notice. A person obligated to withhold by reason of this paragraph (b)(3) is referred to as a withholding agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Person designated to act for withholding agent. The rules stated in Sec. 1.1441-7(b) (1) and (2) regarding a person designated to act for a withholding agent shall apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of withholding exemption granted under Sec. 1.1441-4(f). A letter issued by a district director under the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-4(f), which exempts a person from withholding under section 1441 or section 1442, shall also exempt that person from withholding under this paragraph (b), if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The letter identifies another person as the withholding agent for purposes of section 1441 or 1442, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such other person enters into a written agreement, with the district director who issued the letter, to be the withholding agent for purposes of this paragraph (b).
The exemption granted, and the corresponding withholding obligation imposed, by this paragraph (b)(5) shall apply with respect to the first distribution made after execution of the agreement described in the preceding sentence and shall continue to apply to all distributions made during the period in which the exemption granted under Sec. 1.1441-4(f) is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payment other than in money. The rule stated in Sec. 1.1441-7(c) regarding payment other than in money shall apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount to be withheld--(1) Distribution from a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust. The amount to be withheld under this section with respect to a distribution by a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust shall be computed in the manner described in Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) (ii) and (iii), subject to the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Distribution from a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust. The amount to be withheld under this section with respect to a distribution by a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust shall be computed in the manner described in Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) (ii) and (iii), subject to the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> REITs--(i) In general. The amount to be withheld with respect to a distribution by a REIT, under this section shall be equal to 35 percent (or the highest rate specified in section 1445(e)(1)) of the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The amount to be withheld with respect to a distribution by a REIT, under this section shall be equal to 35 percent (or the highest rate specified in section 1445(e)(1)) of the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount subject to withholding--(A) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the amount subject to withholding is the amount of any distribution, determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend, multiplied by the number of shares or certificates of beneficial interest owned by the foreign person. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the largest amount of any distribution occurring after March 7, 1991 that could be designated as a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3)(C) shall be deemed to have been designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend regardless of the amount actually designated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the amount subject to withholding is the amount of any distribution, determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend, multiplied by the number of shares or certificates of beneficial interest owned by the foreign person. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the largest amount of any distribution occurring after March 7, 1991 that could be designated as a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3)(C) shall be deemed to have been designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend regardless of the amount actually designated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Distribution attributable to net short-term capital gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Designation of prior distribution as capital gain dividend. If a REIT makes an actual designation of a prior distribution, in whole or in part, as a capital gain dividend, such prior distribution shall not be subject to withholding under this section. Rather, a REIT must characterize and treat as a capital gain dividend distribution (solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1)) each distribution, determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, made on the day of, or any time subsequent to, such designation as a capital gain dividend until such characterized amounts equal the amount of the prior distribution designated as a capital gain dividend. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable in any taxable year in which the REIT adopts a formal or informal resolution or plan of complete liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">In the first quarter of 1988, XYZ REIT makes a dividend distribution of $2X. In the

second quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real property, recognizing a long term capital gain of $15X, and makes a dividend distribution of $5X. In the third quarter of 1988, XYZ makes a distribution of $3X. In the fourth quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real property recognizing a long term capital loss of $2X. Within 30 days after the close of the taxable year, XYZ designates a capital gain dividend for the year of $13X. It subsequently makes a fourth quarter distribution of $7X. Since XYZ has made an actual designation of prior distributions during the taxable year as capital gain dividends, withholding on those prior distributions will not be required. However, the REIT must characterize, solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1), a total amount of $13X of dividend distributions as capital gain dividends. Therefore, the fourth quarter dividend distribution of $7X must be characterized as a capital gain dividend subject to withholding under this section. In addition, XYZ will be required to characterize an additional $6X of subsequent dividend distributions as capital gain dividends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definition of nominee. For purposes of this section, the term ``nominee'' means a domestic person that holds an interest in an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section on behalf of another domestic or foreign person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of non-foreign status by withholding agent. A withholding agent may rely on a certificate of non-foreign status pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(b) or on the statements and address provided to it on Form W-9 or a form that is substantailly similar to such form, to determine whether an interest holder is a domestic person. Reliance on these documents will excuse the withholding agent from liability imposed under section 1445(e)(1) in the absence of actual knowledge that the interest holder is a foreign person. A withholding agent may also employ other means to determine the status of an interest holder, but, if the agent relies on such other means and the interest holder proves, in fact, to be a foreign person, then the withholding agent is subject to any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder for failure to withhold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Qualified notice. A qualified notice for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section is a notice given by a partnership, trust or REIT regarding a distribution that is attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest in accordance with the notice requirements with respect to dividends described in 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) (1) or (3) issued pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. In the case of a REIT, a qualified notice is only a notice of a distribution, all or any portion of which the REIT actually designates, or characterizes in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, as a capital gain dividend in accordance with 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) (1) or (3), with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest. A deemed designation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may not be the subject of a qualified notice under this paragraph (f). A person described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be treated as receiving a qualified notice at the time such notice is published in accordance wtih 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) (1) or (3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reporting and paying over withheld amounts. With respect to an amount withheld under this section, a withholding agent is not required to conform to the requirements of Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(5) but is required to report and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service any amount required to be withheld pursuant to the rules and procedures of section 1461, the regulations thereunder and Sec. 1.6302-2. Forms 1042 and 1042S are to be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Early refund procedure not available. The early refund procedure set forth in Sec. 1.1445-6(g) shall not apply to amounts withheld under the rules of this section. For adjustment of over-withheld amounts, see Sec. 1.1461.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Liability upon failure to withhold. For rules regarding liability upon failure to withhold under Sec. 1445(e) and this section, see Sec. 1.1445-1(e).

Sec. 1.1445-10T  Special rule for Foreign governments (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section provides a temporary regulation that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will add a new paragraph (d)(6) to Sec. 1.1445-2. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (d)(6) of Sec. 1.1445-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign government--(1) As transferor. A foreign government is subject to U.S. taxation under section 897 on the disposition of a U.S. real property

interest except to the extent specifically otherwise provided in the regulations issued under section 892. A foreign government that disposes of a U.S. real property interest that is not subject to taxation as specifically provided by the regulations under section 892 may present a notice of nonrecognition treatment pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section that specifically cites the provision of such regulation, and thereby avoids withholding by the transferee of the property. A foreign government that disposes of a U.S. real property interest or the transferee of the property may obtain a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that confirms the applicability of section 892, but neither is required to do so. Rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates are provided in Sec. 1.1445-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As transferor.

Sec. 1.1445-11T  Special rules requiring withholding underSec. 1.1445-5 (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides temporary regulations that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will add certain new paragraphs within Sec. 1.1445-5 (b) and (c). The paragraphs of this section would then appear as set forth below. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (b)(8)(v) of Sec. 1.1445-5. Paragraph (c) of this section would then appear as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Sec. 1.1445-5. Paragraph (d) of this section would then appear as paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1445-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates. The provisions of section 1445(e)(5), requiring withholding upon certain dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates, that own directly or indirectly a U.S. real property interest shall apply to dispositions on or after the effective date of a later Treasury decision under section 897(g) of the Code except in the case of dispositions of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. The provisions of section 1445(e)(5), shall apply, however, to dispositions after June 6, 1988, of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. See paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transactions covered elsewhere. No withholding is required under this paragraph (c) with respect to the distribution of a U.S. real property interest by a partnership, trust, or estate. Such distributions shall be subject to withholding under section 1445(e)(4) and paragraph (f) of this Sec. 1.1445-5 on the effective date of a later Treasury decision published under section 897(g) of the Code. No withholding is required at this time for distributions described in the preceding sentence. See paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this Sec. 1.1445-5. No withholding is required under this paragraph with respect to the disposition of an interest in a trust, estate, or partnership except in the case of a partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. See paragraph (b)(8)(v) of Sec. 1.1445-5. Withholding shall be required as provided in section 1445(e)(5) and paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the disposition after June 6, 1988, of an interest in a partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S.

real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts or estates--(1) Withholding required on disposition of certain partnership interests. Withholding is required under section 1445(e)(5) and this paragraph with respect to the disposition by a foreign partner of an interest in a domestic or foreign partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. For purposes of this paragraph cash equivalents mean any asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. dollars), including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments. The taxpayer on filing an income tax return for the year of the disposition may demonstrate the extent to which the gain on the disposition of the interest is not attributable to U.S. real property interests. A taxpayer is also permitted by Sec. 1.1445-3 to apply for a withholding certificate in instances where reduced withholding is approporiate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Withholding required on disposition of certain partnership interests. Withholding is required under section 1445(e)(5) and this paragraph with respect to the disposition by a foreign partner of an interest in a domestic or foreign partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. For purposes of this paragraph cash equivalents mean any asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. dollars), including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments. The taxpayer on filing an income tax return for the year of the disposition may demonstrate the extent to which the gain on the disposition of the interest is not attributable to U.S. real property interests. A taxpayer is also permitted by Sec. 1.1445-3 to apply for a withholding certificate in instances where reduced withholding is approporiate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding not required--(i) Transferee receives statement that interest in partnership is not described in paragraph (d)(1). No withholding is required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon the disposition of a partnership interest otherwise described in that paragraph if the transferee is provided a statement, issued by the partnership and signed by a general partner under penalties of perjury no earlier than 30 days before the transfer, certifying that fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets does not consist of U.S. real property interests, or that ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets of the partnership does not consist of U.S. real property interests plus cash or cash equivalents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transferee receives statement that interest in partnership is not described in paragraph (d)(1). No withholding is required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon the disposition of a partnership interest otherwise described in that paragraph if the transferee is provided a statement, issued by the partnership and signed by a general partner under penalties of perjury no earlier than 30 days before the transfer, certifying that fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets does not consist of U.S. real property interests, or that ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets of the partnership does not consist of U.S. real property interests plus cash or cash equivalents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reliance on statement not permitted. A transferee is not entitled to rely upon a statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if, prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Receives a notice, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4.
Such a transferee's withholding obligations shall apply as if the statement had never been given, and such a transferee may be held fully liable pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Belated notice of false statement. If, after the date of the transfer, a transferee receives notice that a statement provided under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is false, then such transferee may rely on the statement only with respect to consideration that was paid prior to the receipt of the notice. Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 10 percent of the amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to the transferor. Thus, if 10 percent or more of the amount realized remains to be paid to the transferor, then the transferee is required to withhold and pay over the full 10 percent. The transferee must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each successive payment of consideration to the transferor, until the full 10 percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee that is subject to the rules of this Sec. 1.1445-10T(d)(2)(iii) may not obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3, but must instead withhold and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. The rules of this section are effective for transactions after June 6, 1988.
