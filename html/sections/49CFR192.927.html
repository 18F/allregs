                                Sec. 192.927  What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a  process an operator uses to identify areas along the pipeline where  fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an  upset condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the  locations in covered segments where internal corrosion is most likely to  exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion  caused by microorganisms, or fluid with CO2, O2,  hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an  assessment method to address internal corrosion in a covered pipeline  segment must follow the requirements in this   section and in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 192.7), section 6.4 and appendix B2. The ICDA process described in  this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting nominally  dry natural gas, and not for a segment with electrolyte nominally  present in the gas stream. If an operator uses ICDA to assess a covered  segment operating with electrolyte present in the gas stream, the  operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct ICDA  in the segment to effectively address internal corrosion, and must  provide notification in accordance with Sec. 192.921 (a)(4) or  Sec. 192.937(c)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ICDA plan. An operator must develop and follow an ICDA plan  that provides for preassessment, identification of ICDA regions and  excavation locations, detailed examination of pipe at excavation  locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preassessment. In the preassessment stage, an operator must  gather and integrate data and information needed to evaluate the  feasibility of ICDA for the covered segment, and to support use of a  model to identify the locations along the pipe segment where electrolyte  may accumulate, to identify ICDA regions, and to identify areas within  the covered segment where liquids may potentially be entrained. This  data and information includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All data elements listed in appendix A2 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information needed to support use of a model that an operator  must use to identify areas along the pipeline where internal corrosion  is most likely to occur. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) This  information, includes, but is not limited to, location of all gas input  and withdrawal points on the line; location of all low points on covered  segments such as sags, drips, inclines, valves, manifolds, dead-legs,  and traps; the elevation profile of the pipeline in sufficient detail  that angles of inclination can be calculated for all pipe segments; and  the diameter of the pipeline, and the range of expected gas velocities  in the pipeline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operating experience data that would indicate historic upsets  in gas conditions, locations where these upsets have occurred, and  potential damage resulting from these upset conditions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information on covered segments where cleaning pigs may not  have been used or where cleaning pigs may deposit electrolytes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ICDA region identification. An operator's plan must identify  where all ICDA Regions are located in the transmission system, in which  covered segments are located. An ICDA Region extends from the location  where liquid may first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire  area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may occur and where  further evaluation is needed. An ICDA Region may encompass one or more  covered segments. In the identification process, an operator must use  the model in GRI 02-0057, ``Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment of Gas  Transmission Pipelines--Methodology,'' (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 192.7). An operator may use another model if the operator  demonstrates it is equivalent to the one shown in GRI 02-0057. A model  must consider changes in pipe diameter, locations where gas enters a  line (potential to introduce liquid) and locations down stream of gas  draw-offs (where gas velocity is reduced) to define the critical pipe  angle of inclination above which water film cannot be transported by the  gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of locations for excavation and direct  examination. An operator's plan must identify the locations where  internal corrosion is most likely in each ICDA region. In the location  identification process, an operator must identify a minimum of two  locations for excavation within each ICDA Region within a covered  segment and must perform a direct examination for internal corrosion at  each location, using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or  other generally accepted measurement technique. One location must be the  low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps)  within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA Region.  The second location must be further downstream, within a covered  segment, near the end of the ICDA Region. If corrosion exists at either  location, the operator must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and  remediate the defect in accordance with Sec. 192.933;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As part of the operator's current integrity assessment either  perform additional excavations in each covered segment within the ICDA  region, or use an alternative assessment method allowed by this subpart  to assess the line pipe in each covered segment within the ICDA region  for internal corrosion; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all pipeline  segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline  system with similar characteristics to the ICDA region containing the  covered segment in which the corrosion was found, and as appropriate,  remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with  Sec. 192.933.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. An operator's plan  must provide for evaluating the effectiveness of the ICDA process and  continued monitoring of covered segments where internal corrosion has  been identified. The evaluation and monitoring process includes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluating the effectiveness of ICDA as an assessment method for  addressing internal corrosion and determining whether a covered segment  should be reassessed at more frequent intervals than those specified in  Sec. 192.939. An operator must carry out this evaluation within a year  of conducting an ICDA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Continually monitoring each covered segment where internal  corrosion has been identified using techniques such as coupons, UT  sensors or electronic probes, periodically drawing off liquids at low  points and chemically analyzing the liquids for the presence of  corrosion products. An operator must base the frequency of the  monitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments  that have been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this  subpart, and risk factors specific to the covered segment. If an  operator finds any evidence of corrosion products in the covered  segment, the operator must take prompt action in accordance with one of  the two following required actions and remediate the conditions the  operator finds in accordance with Sec. 192.933.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Conduct excavations of covered segments at locations downstream  from where the electrolyte might have entered the pipe; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Assess the covered segment using another integrity assessment  method allowed by this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other requirements. The ICDA plan must also include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Criteria an operator will apply in making key decisions (e.g.,  ICDA feasibility, definition of ICDA Regions, conditions requiring  excavation) in implementing each stage of the ICDA process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when  conducting ICDA for the first time on a covered segment and that become  less stringent as the operator gains experience; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provisions that analysis be carried out on the entire pipeline  in which covered segments are present, except that application of the  remediation criteria of Sec. 192.933 may be limited to covered segments.
