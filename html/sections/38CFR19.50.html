Such appeals may be taken not only from determinations involving dissenting opinions, but also from unanimous determinations denying or allowing the benefit claimed in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of Appeal. An administrative appeal is entered by a memorandum entitled ``Administrative Appeal'' in which the issues and the basis for the appeal are set forth.
