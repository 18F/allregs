                                Sec. 2635.401  Overview.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This subpart contains two provisions relating to financial  interests. One is a disqualification requirement and the other is a  prohibition on acquiring or continuing to hold specific financial  interests. An employee may acquire or hold any financial interest not  prohibited by Sec. 2635.403. Notwithstanding that his acquisition or  holding of a particular interest is proper, an employee is prohibited in  accordance with Sec. 2635.402 of this subpart from participating in an  official capacity in any particular matter in which, to his knowledge,  he or any person whose interests are imputed to him has a financial  interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable  effect on that interest. See also part 2640 of this chapter, for  additional guidance amplifying Sec. 2635.402.  [57 FR 35042, Aug. 7, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 48747, Sept. 17, 1997]</p>
