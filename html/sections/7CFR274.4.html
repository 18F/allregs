                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reconciliation. State agencies shall account for all issuance  through a reconciliation process. The EBT system shall provide reports  and documentation pertaining to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reconciliation. Reconciliation shall be conducted and records  kept as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reconciliation of benefits posted to household accounts on the  central computer against benefits on the Issuance Authorization File;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reconciliation of individual household account balances against  account activities on a daily basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reconciliation of each individual retail store's SNAP  transactions per POS terminal and in total to deposits on a daily basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Verification of retailer's credits against deposit information  entered into the automated clearinghouse (ACH) network;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reconciliation of total funds entered into, exiting from, and  remaining in the system each day;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Maintenance of audit trails that document the full cycle of  issuance from benefit allotment posting to the State issuance  authorization file through posting to POS transactions at retailers  through settlement of retailer credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Management reports. The State agency shall require the EBT  system to provide reports that enable the State agency to manage the  system. The reports shall be available to the State agency or FNS as  requested on a timely basis and consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information on how the system operates relative to its  performance standards, the incidence, type and cause of system problems,  and utilization patterns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retailer transaction data submitted to FNS on a monthly basis.  This data must be submitted in the specified format in accordance with  the required schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data detailing by specified category the amount of Program  benefits issued or returned through the EBT system shall be provided in  a format and mechanism specified by FNS to the FNS Account Management  Agent as the benefits become available to recipients. This data will be  used to increase or decrease the SNAP EBT benefit funding authorization  for the State's Automated Standard Application for Payment (ASAP)  account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required reports. The State agency shall review and submit the  following reports to FNS on a monthly basis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form FNS-46, Issuance Reconciliation Report, shall be submitted  by each State agency operating an issuance system. The report shall be  prepared at the level of the State agency where the actual  reconciliation of posted benefits and the master issuance file occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall identify and report the number and value  of all issuances which do not reconcile with the master issuance file.  All unreconciled issuances shall be identified as specified on this  reporting document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The report shall be received by FNS no later than 90 days  following the end of the report month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form FNS-388, State Issuance and Participation Estimates. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  State agencies shall telephone or transmit by computer the Form FNS-388  data and mail the reports to the FNS regional office no later than the  19th day of each month. When the 19th falls on a weekend or holiday, the  Form FNS-388 data shall be reported by telephone or transmitted by  computer and mailed on the first work day after the 19th. The Form FNS- 388 report shall be signed by the person responsible for completing the  report or a designated State agency official.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Form FNS-388 report shall provide Statewide estimated or  actual totals of issuance and participation for the current and previous  month, and actual or final participation totals for the second preceding  month. In addition to the participation totals for the second preceding  months of January and July, provided on the March and September reports,  non-assistance (NA) and public assistance (PA) household and person  participation breakdowns shall be provided. As an attachment to the  March and September Form FNS-388 reports, State agencies shall provide  project area breakdowns of benefit issuance and NA/PA household and  person participation data for the second preceding months of January and  July.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State agencies shall submit any proposed changes in their  estimation procedures to be used in determining the Form FNS-388 data to  the FNS regional office for review and comment. FNS shall monitor the  accuracy of the Statewide estimated dollar value of benefits issued and  the number of households and persons participating as reported on the  Form FNS-388 report against the Statewide actual total participation as  reported on succeeding Form FNS-388 reports and against the semiannual  project area participation totals attached to the March and September  Form FNS-388 reports. The FNS accuracy standards for the issuance and  participation estimates are that estimates for the current month be  within (+) or (-) four (4) percent of actual levels, and the estimates  for the previous month be within (+) or (-) two (2) percent of actual  levels. State agencies shall explain any unusual circumstances that  cause benefit issuance and/or participation data to not meet these  accuracy standards. If a State agency fails to meet these accuracy  standards, FNS shall notify the State agency and assist the State agency  in revising its estimating procedures to improve its reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A participating household is one that is certified and has  been, or will be, issued benefits (whether or not the benefits are  used), and households that have met the eligibility requirements, but  will receive zero benefits.</p>
