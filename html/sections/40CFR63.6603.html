                            <p class="depth0">Compliance with the numerical emission limitations established in  this subpart is based on the results of testing the average of three 1- hour runs using the testing requirements and procedures in Sec. 63.6620  and Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you own or operate an existing stationary RICE located at an  area source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the requirements in  Table 2d to this subpart and the operating limitations in Table 2b to  this subpart that apply to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section must meet the  management practices that are shown for stationary non-emergency CI RICE  with a site rating of less than or equal to 300 HP in Table 2d of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The area source is located in an area of Alaska that is not  accessible by the Federal Aid Highway System (FAHS).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>, (ii), and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The only connection to the FAHS is through the Alaska Marine  Highway System (AMHS), or the stationary RICE operation is within an  isolated grid in Alaska that is not connected to the statewide  electrical grid referred to as the Alaska Railbelt Grid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 10 percent of the power generated by the stationary  RICE on an annual basis is used for residential purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The generating capacity of the area source is less than 12  megawatts, or the stationary RICE is used exclusively for backup power  for renewable energy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you own or operate an existing stationary non-emergency CI  RICE with a site rating of more than 300 HP located on an offshore  vessel that is an area source of HAP and is a nonroad vehicle that is an  Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) source as defined in 40 CFR 55.2, you do  not have to meet the numerical CO emission limitations specified in  Table 2d of this subpart. You must meet all of the following management  practices:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Change oil every 1,000 hours of operation or annually, whichever  comes first. Sources have the option to utilize an oil analysis program  as described in Sec. 63.6625(i) in order to extend the specified oil  change requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspect and clean air filters every 750 hours of operation or  annually, whichever comes first, and replace as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspect fuel filters and belts, if installed, every 750 hours of  operation or annually, whichever comes first, and replace as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inspect all flexible hoses every 1,000 hours of operation or  annually, whichever comes first, and replace as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you own or operate an existing non-emergency CI RICE with a  site rating of more than 300 HP located at an area source of HAP  emissions that is certified to the Tier 1 or Tier 2 emission standards  in Table 1 of 40 CFR 89.112 and that is subject to an enforceable state  or local standard that requires the engine to be replaced no later than  June 1, 2018, you may until January 1, 2015, or 12 years after the  installation date of the engine (whichever is later), but not later than  June 1, 2018, choose to comply with the management practices that are  shown for stationary non-emergency CI RICE with a site rating of less  than or equal   to 300 HP in Table 2d of this subpart instead of the applicable emission  limitations in Table 2d, operating limitations in Table 2b, and  crankcase ventilation system requirements in Sec. 63.6625(g). You must  comply with the emission limitations in Table 2d and operating  limitations in Table 2b that apply for non-emergency CI RICE with a site  rating of more than 300 HP located at an area source of HAP emissions by  January 1, 2015, or 12 years after the installation date of the engine  (whichever is later), but not later than June 1, 2018. You must also  comply with the crankcase ventilation system requirements in Sec.  63.6625(g) by January 1, 2015, or 12 years after the installation date  of the engine (whichever is later), but not later than June 1, 2018.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you own or operate an existing non-emergency CI RICE with a  site rating of more than 300 HP located at an area source of HAP  emissions that is certified to the Tier 3 (Tier 2 for engines above 560  kilowatt (kW)) emission standards in Table 1 of 40 CFR 89.112, you may  comply with the requirements under this part by meeting the requirements  for Tier 3 engines (Tier 2 for engines above 560 kW) in 40 CFR part 60  subpart IIII instead of the emission limitations and other requirements  that would otherwise apply under this part for existing non-emergency CI  RICE with a site rating of more than 300 HP located at an area source of  HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An existing non-emergency SI 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE with  a site rating of more than 500 HP located at area sources of HAP must  meet the definition of remote stationary RICE in Sec. 63.6675 on the  initial compliance date for the engine, October 19, 2013, in order to be  considered a remote stationary RICE under this subpart. Owners and  operators of existing non-emergency SI 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE  with a site rating of more than 500 HP located at area sources of HAP  that meet the definition of remote stationary RICE in Sec. 63.6675 of  this subpart as of October 19, 2013 must evaluate the status of their  stationary RICE every 12 months. Owners and operators must keep records  of the initial and annual evaluation of the status of the engine. If the  evaluation indicates that the stationary RICE no longer meets the  definition of remote stationary RICE in Sec. 63.6675 of this subpart,  the owner or operator must comply with all of the requirements for  existing non-emergency SI 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE with a site  rating of more than 500 HP located at area sources of HAP that are not  remote stationary RICE within 1 year of the evaluation.
