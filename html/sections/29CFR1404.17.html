                            <p class="depth0">In an effort to reduce the time and expense of some grievance  arbitrations, FMCS offers expedited procedures that may be appropriate  in certain non-precedential cases or those that do not involve complex  or unique issues. Expedited arbitration is intended to be a mutually  agreed-upon process whereby arbitrator appointments, hearings and awards  are acted upon quickly by the parties, FMCS, and the arbitrators.  Mandating short deadlines and eliminating requirements for transcripts,  briefs and lengthy opinions streamline the process.  [70 FR 76399, Dec. 27, 2005]</p>
