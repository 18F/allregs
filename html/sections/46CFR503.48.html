The Secretary will notify the requestor of the

decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon request, the following services are available upon the payment of the fees hereinafter prescribed; except that no fees shall be assessed for search, duplication or review in connection with requests for single copies of materials described in Sec.
