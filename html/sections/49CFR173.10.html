                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tank cars containing any 2.1 material (including a cryogenic  liquid) or Class 3 material with a flash point below 38 C (100 F),  except liquid road asphalt or tar, may not be offered for transportation  unless originally consigned or subsequently reconsigned to parties  having private-siding (see Note 1 of this section) or to parties using  railroad siding facilities which have been equipped for piping the  liquid from tank cars to permanent storage tanks of sufficient capacity  to receive contents of car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A tank car containing any Class 2 material must not be offered  for transportation unless the car is consigned for delivery (see  paragraph (c) of this section) and unloading on a private track (see  Note 1 of this section) except that where no private track is available,  delivery and unloading on carrier tracks is permitted provided the  following conditions are complied with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any tank car of DOT-106A or 110A type (see Secs. 179.300 and  179.301 of this subchapter) may be offered for transportation and the  loaded unit tanks may be removed from car frame on carrier tracks,  provided the shipper has obtained from the delivering carrier and filed  with originating carrier, written permission (see Note 2 of this  section) for such removal. The consignee must furnish adequately safe  mechanical hoist, obtained from the carrier if desirable, by which the  tanks shall be lifted from the car and deposited directly upon vehicles  furnished by the consignee for immediate removal from carrier property  or tanks must be lifted by adequately safe mechanical hoist from car  directly to vessels for further transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any tank car of other than DOT-106A or 110A type (see  Secs. 179.300 and 179.301 of this subchapter), containing anhydrous  ammonia, liquefied hydrocarbon or liquefied petroleum gas, and having  interior pipes of liquid and gas discharge valves equipped with check  valves, may be consigned for delivery and unloading on carrier tracks,  if the lading is piped directly from the car to permanent storage tanks  of sufficient capacity to receive the entire contents of the car. Such  cars may also be consigned for storage on a private track or on a  carrier track when designated by the carrier for such storage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For cars of the DOT-106A or 110A type (see Secs. 179.300 and  179.301 of this subchapter), the tanks must be placed in position and  attached to the car structure by the shipper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Class 3 materials with a flash point below 38 C (100 F) and  Division 2.1 materials (including a cryogenic liquid) may not be loaded  into tank cars on carrier property from tank trucks or drums.</p><p class="depth2">Note 1: For this purpose, a private track is a track outside of  carrier's right-of-way, yard, and terminals, and of which the carrier  does not own either the rails, ties, roadbed or right-of-way; or a track  or portion of a track which is devoted to the purpose of its user,  either by lease or written agreement; in which case the lease or written  agreement will be considered as equivalent to ownership.</p><p class="depth2">Note 2: Carriers should give permission for the unloading of these  containers on carrier tracks only where no private siding is available  within reasonable trucking distance of final destination. The danger  involved is the release of compressed gases due to accidental   damage to container in handling. The exposure to this danger decreases  directly with the isolation of the unloading point.  [29 FR 18773, Dec. 29, 1964.
