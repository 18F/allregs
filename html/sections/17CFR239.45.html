Terms used have the same meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Registrant requirements. Registrants must meet the following conditions in order to use this Form for registration under the Securities Act

of asset-backed securities offered in the transactions specified in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form required to comply with the transaction requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, the following requirements shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all certifications required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all transaction agreements containing the provisions that are required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If such depositor or issuing entity fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, such depositor or issuing entity will be deemed to satisfy such requirements for purposes of this Form 90 days after the date it files the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; provided however that if the information is filed within 90 days of evaluating compliance with this paragraph (a) such depositor and issuing entity will be deemed to have been in compliance with such requirements for purposes of this Form 90 days after the date it files the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to paragraph (a)(1). The registrant must provide disclosure in a prospectus that is part of the registration statement that it has met the registrant requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed securities pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such materials). In addition, such material must have been filed in a timely manner, other than a report that is required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, or 6.03 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308). If Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter was used during such period with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has actually been filed within the time period prescribed by Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter. Regarding an affiliated depositor that became an affiliate as a result of a business combination transaction during such period, the filing of any material prior to the business combination transaction relating to asset-backed securities of an issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is excluded from this section, provided such business combination transaction was not part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. See the definition of ``affiliate'' in Sec. 230.405 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transaction Requirements.

Reviews shall be required under the transaction documents, at a minimum, when the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A threshold of delinquent assets, as specified in the transaction agreements, has been reached or exceeded; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An investor vote to direct a review, pursuant to the processes specified in the transaction agreements, provided that the agreement not require more than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 5% of the total interest in the pool in order to initiate a vote and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A simple majority of those interests casting a vote to direct a review by the asset representations reviewer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The asset representations reviewer shall perform, at a minimum, reviews of all assets 60 days or more delinquent when the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section are met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The asset representations reviewer shall provide a report to the trustee of the findings and conclusions of the review of the assets.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to paragraph (b)(1)(ii). The threshold of delinquent assets shall be calculated as a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of delinquent assets in a given pool to the aggregate dollar amount of all the assets in that particular pool, measured as of the end of the reporting period. If the transaction has multiple sub-pools, the transaction agreements must provide that:</p><p class="depth0">1. The delinquency threshold shall be calculated with respect to each sub-pool; and</p><p class="depth0">2. The investor vote calculation shall be measured as a percentage of investors' interest in each sub-pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dispute resolution provision. With respect to each offering of securities that is registered on this Form, the pooling and servicing agreement or other transaction agreement, which shall be filed, must provide for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If an asset subject to a repurchase request, pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements, is not resolved by the end of a 180-day period beginning when notice of the request is received, then the party submitting such repurchase request shall have the right to refer the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation or third-party arbitration, and the party obligated to repurchase must agree to the selected resolution method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the party submitting the request elects third-party arbitration, the arbitrator shall determine the allocation of any expenses. If the party submitting the request elects mediation, the parties shall mutually determine the allocation of any expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Investor communication provision. With respect to each offering of securities that is registered on this Form, the pooling and servicing agreement or other transaction agreement, which shall be filed, must contain a provision requiring that the party responsible for making periodic filings on Form 10-D (Sec. 249.312 of this chapter) include in the Form 10-D any request received during the reporting period from an investor to communicate with other investors related to investors exercising their rights under the terms of the transaction agreements. The disclosure regarding the request to communicate is

required to include no more than the name of the investor making the request, the date the request was received, a statement to the effect that the party responsible for filing the Form 10-D has received a request from such investor, stating that such investor is interested in communicating with other investors with regard to the possible exercise of rights under the transaction agreements, and a description of the method other investors may use to contact the requesting investor.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to paragraph (b)(1)(iv). If an underlying transaction agreement contains procedures in order to verify that an investor is, in fact, a beneficial owner for purposes of invoking the investor communication provision, the verification procedures may require no more than the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. If the investor is a record holder of the securities at the time of a request to communicate, then the investor will not have to provide verification of ownership, and</p><p class="depth0">2. If the investor is not the record holder of the securities, then the person obligated to make the disclosure may require no more than a written certification from the investor that it is a beneficial owner and one other form of documentation such as a trade confirmation, an account statement, a letter from the broker or dealer, or other similar document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Delinquent assets. Delinquent assets do not constitute 20% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of the asset pool as of the measurement date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Residual value for certain securities. With respect to securities that are backed by leases other than motor vehicle leases, the portion of the securitized pool balance attributable to the residual value of the physical property underlying the leases, as determined in accordance with the transaction agreements for the securities, does not constitute 20% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Securities relating to an offering of asset-backed securities registered in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section where those securities represent an interest in or the right to the payments of cash flows of another asset pool and meet the requirements of Sec. 230.190(c)(1) through (4) of this chapter.
