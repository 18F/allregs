                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Inconsistent state laws. Except as otherwise provided in this section, this regulation alters, affects, or preempts only those state laws that are inconsistent with the Act and this regulation and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is not inconsistent if it is more protective of an applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preempted provisions of state law. (1) A state law is deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this regulation and less protective of an applicant within the meaning of section 705(f) of the Act to the extent that the law:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the Act or this regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prohibits the individual extension of consumer credit to both parties to a marriage if each spouse individually and voluntarily applies for such credit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prohibits inquiries or collection of data required to comply with the Act or this regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Prohibits asking about or considering age in an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system to determine a pertinent element of creditworthiness, or to favor an elderly applicant; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prohibits inquiries necessary to establish or administer a special purpose credit program as defined by Sec. 202.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A creditor, state, or other interested party may request that the Board determine whether a state law is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Laws on finance charges, loan ceilings. If married applicants voluntarily apply for and obtain individual accounts with the same creditor, the accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under any federal or state law. Permissible loan ceiling laws shall be construed to permit each spouse to become individually liable up to the amount of the loan ceilings, less the amount for which the applicant is jointly liable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> State and federal laws not affected. This section does not alter or annul any provision of state property laws, laws relating to the disposition of decedents' estates, or federal or state banking regulations directed only toward insuring the solvency of financial institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exemption for state-regulated transactions--(1) Applications. A state may apply to the Board for an exemption from the requirements of the Act and this regulation for any class of credit transactions within the state. The Board will grant such an exemption if the Board determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The class of credit transactions is subject to state law requirements substantially similar to those of the Act and this regulation or that applicants are afforded greater protection under state law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is adequate provision for state enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability and enforcement. (i) No exemption will extend to the civil liability provisions of section 706 of the Act or the administrative enforcement provisions of section 704 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After an exemption has been granted, the requirements of the applicable state law (except for additional requirements not imposed by federal law) will constitute the requirements of the Act and this regulation.</p>
