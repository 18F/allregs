The contracting officer may alter this clause and Alternate 1 of this clause before issuing the solicitation or during competition by amending the solicitation. Insignificant changes may also be made by the contracting officer on a case-by-case basis during negotiation, without amending the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">Financial Status Report (OCT 1999)</p><p class="depth0">The contractor shall provide a monthly Financial Status Report (FSR) to the project officer and the contracting officer. The FSR shall include the acquisition of, or changes in the status of, contractor-held property acquired with government funds valued at the time of purchase at $50,000 or more. Whenever these types of property changes occur, the contractor shall send a copy of the report to the Chief, Property and Acquisition Oversight Branch, Office of Administration. The report is due within 15 calendar days after the end of the report period and must identify the title of the project, the contract number, the appropriate financial tracking code (e.g., Job Code Number or JCN) specified by the NRC Project Officer, project manager and/or principal investigator, the contract period of performance, and the period covered by the report. Each report must include the following information for each discrete task:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Total estimated contract amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Total funds obligated to date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Total costs incurred this reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Total costs incurred to date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Detail of all direct and indirect costs incurred during the reporting period for the entire contract or each task, if it is a task ordering contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Balance of obligations remaining.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Balance of funds required to complete contract/task order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) status: A revised CSP is required with the Financial Status Report whenever the contractor or the contracting officer has reason to believe that the total cost for performance of this contract will be either greater or substantially less than what had been previously estimated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Projected percentage of completion cumulative through the report period for the project/task order as reflected in the current CSP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indicate significant changes in the original CSP projection in either dollars or percentage of completion.
