In determining this amount, the agency head  must consider the relative earnings, responsibilities, expenses,  workload, working conditions, conditions of employment, and personnel  benefits for physicians in each category and for comparable physicians  inside and outside the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies may not pay a physicians' comparability allowance in  excess of $14,000 annually to a physician with 24 months or less of  service as a Government physician. Agencies may not pay a physicians'  comparability allowance in excess of $30,000 annually to a physician  with more than 24 months of service as a Government physician.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining length of service as a Government physician,  agencies must exclude periods of leave without pay. However, agencies  may credit any prior service as a Government physician, including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior service as a physician under sections 7401 and 7405 of  title 38, United States Code; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior active service as a medical officer in the Commissioned  Corps of the Public Health Service under title II of the Public Health  Service Act (42 U.S.C. chapter 6A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A physician who is employed on a regularly scheduled part-time  basis of half-time or more is eligible to receive a physicians'  comparability allowance, but any such allowance must be prorated  according to the proportion of the physicians' work schedule to full- time employment. A physician who is employed on less than a half-time or  intermittent basis is excluded from the physicians' comparability  allowance program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A physician who is serving with the Government under a loan  repayment program must have the amount of any loan being repaid deducted  from any physicians' comparability allowance for which he or she is  eligible and may receive only that portion of such allowance which  exceeds the amount of the loan being repaid during the period of  employment required by the service agreement under the student loan  repayment program.
