                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Not less than 30 days before completion of the contract, the  predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer  a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the  contract and its   subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified list must  also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee  under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on  this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by  paragraph (n) of the clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor  Standards. If there are no changes to the workforce before the  predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is  not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of  performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are  changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the  predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less  than 10 days prior to performance completion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list  but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the  certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if  requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors  or their authorized representatives.
