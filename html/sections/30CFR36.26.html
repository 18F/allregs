The engine shall be submitted to  MSHA by the applicant in such condition that it can be tested  immediately at full load and speed. The preliminary liquid-fuel- injection rate shall be such that the exhaust will not contain black  smoke and the applicant shall adjust the injection rate promptly to  correct any adverse conditions disclosed by preliminary tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final engine adjustment. The liquid fuel supply to the engine  shall be adjusted so that the undiluted exhaust gas shall contain not  more than 0.30 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide or 0.20 percent,  by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen  dioxide, NO2) under any conditions of engine operation  prescribed by MSHA when the intake air mixture to the engine contains  1.5 0.1 percent, by volume, of Pittsburgh natural  gas. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Investigation has shown that for practical purposes, Pittsburgh  natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory  substitute for pure methane in these tests. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coupling or adapter. The applicant shall provide the coupling or  adapter for connecting the engine to MSHA's dynamometer.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Preferably this coupling or adapter should be attached to the  flywheel of the engine.   Clutches, transmissions, or torque converters ordinarily are not  required in the coupling train.</p>
