                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No construction work shall be performed by convict labor at the  work site or within the limits of any Federal-aid highway construction  project from the time of award of the contract or the start of work on  force account until final acceptance of the work by the STD unless it is  labor performed by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or  probation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No procedures or requirement shall be imposed by any State which  will operate to discriminate against the employment of labor from any  other State, possession or territory of the United States, in the  construction of a Federal-aid project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The selection of labor to be employed by the contractor on any  Federal-aid project shall be by the contractor without regard to race,  color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap and in  accordance with 23 CFR part 230, 41 CFR part 60 and Exec.   Order No. 11246 (Sept. 24, 1965), 3 CFR 339 (1964-1965), as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, it is permissible for STD's to  implement procedures or requirements which will extend preferential  employment to Indians living on or near a reservation on eligible  projects as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Indian preference  shall be applied without regard to tribal affiliation or place of  enrollment. In no instance should a contractor be compelled to layoff or  terminate a permanent core-crew employee to meet a preference goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Projects eligible for Indian employment preference consideration  are projects located on roads within or providing access to an Indian  reservation or other Indian lands as defined under the term ``Indian  Reservation Roads'' in 23 U.S.C. 101 and regulations issued thereunder.  The terminus of a road ``providing access to'' is that point at which it  intersects with a road functionally classified as a collector or higher  classification (outside the reservation boundary) in both urban and  rural areas. In the case of an Interstate highway, the terminus is the  first interchange outside the reservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The advertisement or call for bids on any contract for the  construction of a project located on the Federal-aid system either shall  include the minimum wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor to  be prevailing on the same type of work on similar construction in the  immediate locality or shall provide that such rates are set out in the  bidding documents and shall further specify that such rates are a part  of the contract covering the project.</p>
