                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each baghouse applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate, and maintain each bag leak detection system according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting emissions of particulate matter at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system must provide output of relative changes in particulate matter loadings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system must be equipped with an alarm that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loadings is detected over a preset level. The alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each system that works based on the triboelectric effect must be installed, operated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the guidance document, ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). You may install, operate, and maintain other types of bag leak detection systems in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To make the initial adjustment of the system, establish the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device. Then, establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Following the initial adjustment, do not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time, except as detailed in your operation and maintenance plan. Do not increase the sensitivity by more than 100 percent or decrease the sensitivity by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless a responsible official certifies, in writing, that the baghouse has been inspected and found to be in good operating condition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each CPMS required in Sec. 63.7330, you must develop and make available for inspection upon request by the permitting authority a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installation of the CPMS sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and (8);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance the general requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CPMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must operate and maintain the CPMS in continuous operation according to the site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate, and maintain CPMS to measure and record the pressure drop across the scrubber and scrubber water flow rate during each push according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section except as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each CPMS must complete a measurement at least once per push;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each CPMS must produce valid data for all pushes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each CPMS must determine and record the daily (24-hour) average of all recorded readings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate, and maintain CPMS to measure and record the water pressure and temperature during each push according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you elect the operating limit in Sec. 63.7290(b)(3) for a capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate, and maintain a device to measure the total volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you elect the operating limit in Sec. 63.7290(b)(3)(i) for a capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must

install, operate, and maintain a device to measure the fan motor amperes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If you elect the operating limit in Sec. 63.7290(b)(3)(ii) for a capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate and maintain a device to measure static pressure at the inlet of the control device or the fan RPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For each by-product coke oven battery, you must install, operate, and maintain a COMS to measure and record the opacity of emissions exiting each stack according to the requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install, operate, and maintain each COMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(e) and Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. Identify periods the COMS is out-of-control, including any periods that the COMS fails to pass a daily calibration drift assessment, quarterly performance audit, or annual zero alignment audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each COMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must develop and implement a quality control program for operating and maintaining each COMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(d). At minimum, the quality control program must include a daily calibration drift assessment, quarterly performance audit, and an annual zero alignment audit of each COMS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each COMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period. You must reduce the COMS data as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must determine and record the hourly and daily (24-hour) average opacity according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7324(b) using all the 6-minute averages collected for periods during which the COMS is not out-of-control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> For each multicyclone applied to pushing emissions, you must install, operate, and maintain CPMS to measure and record the pressure drop across each multicyclone during each push according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section except as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
