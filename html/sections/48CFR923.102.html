                            <p class="depth0">Many of the Department's major facilities are operated by contractors. Provisions regarding those contracts may be found at part 970 of this chapter. At other locations, the Department makes significant use of contractors to operate and maintain its facilities. As such, the Department encourages the greatest possible use of energy efficient and environmentally sustainable products and services by its facility support contractors. The DOE Sustainable Acquisition Program is to be followed by all contractors operating DOE facilities or motor vehicle fleets.</p>
