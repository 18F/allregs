                            <p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 351.504: Compliance dates: Subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. Section 7116(a)(7), agencies may implement revised Sec. 351.504 at any time between December 24, 1997 and October 1, 1998. For reduction in force actions effective between December 24, 1997 and September 30, 1998, agencies may use either Sec. 351.504 effective December 24, 1997, or the prior Sec. 351.504 in 5 CFR part 351 (January 1, 1997 edition).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ratings used. (1) Only ratings of record as defined in Sec. 351.203 shall be used as the basis for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only ratings of record as defined in Sec. 351.203 shall be used as the basis for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For employees who received ratings of record while covered by part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those ratings of record shall be used to grant additional retention service credit in a reduction in force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For employees who received performance ratings while not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those performance ratings shall be considered ratings of record for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force only when it is determined that those performance ratings are equivalent ratings of record under the provisions of Sec. 430.201(c) of this chapter. The agency conducting the reduction in force shall make that determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> An employee's entitlement to additional retention service credit for performance under this subpart shall be based on the employee's three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee's entitlement to additional retention service credit for performance under this subpart shall be based on the employee's three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To provide adequate time to determine employee retention standing, an agency may provide for a cutoff date, a specified number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings of record will be put on record and used for purposes of this subpart. When a cutoff date is used, an employee will receive performance credit for the three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the cutoff date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To be creditable for purposes of this subpart, a rating of record must have been issued to the employee, with all appropriate reviews and signatures, and must also be on record (i.e., the rating of record is available for use by the office responsible for establishing retention registers).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The awarding of additional retention service credit based on performance for purposes of this subpart must be uniformly and consistently applied within a competitive area, and must be consistent with the agency's appropriate issuance(s) that implement these policies. Each agency must specify in its appropriate issuance(s):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The conditions under which a rating of record is considered to have been received for purposes of determining whether it is within the 4-year period prior to either the date the agency issues reduction in force notices or the agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the agency elects to use a cutoff date, the number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings of record will be put on record and used for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Missing ratings. Additional retention service credit for employees who do not have three actual ratings of record during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices or the 4-year period prior to the agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record permitted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be determined under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, as appropriate, and as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee who has not received any rating of record during the 4-year period shall receive credit for performance based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record at the time of the reduction in force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record during the 4-year period shall receive credit for performance on the basis of the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received. If an employee has received only two actual ratings of record during the period, the value of the ratings is added together and divided by two (and rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) to determine the amount of additional retention service credit. If an employee has received only one actual rating of record during the period, its value is the amount of additional retention service credit provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Single rating pattern. If all employees in a reduction in force competitive area have received ratings of record under a single pattern of summary levels as set forth in Sec. 430.208(d) of this chapter, the additional retention service credit provided to employees shall be expressed in additional years of service and shall consist of the mathematical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the employee's applicable ratings of record, under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section computed on the following basis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Twenty additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 5 (Outstanding or equivalent) summary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sixteen additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 4 summary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Twelve additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) summary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple rating patterns. If an agency has employees in a competitive area who have ratings of record under more than one pattern of summary levels, as set forth in Sec. 430.208(d) of this chapter, it shall consider the mix of patterns and provide additional retention service credit for performance to employees expressed in additional years of service in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additional years of service shall consist of the mathematical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the additional retention service credit that the agency established for the summary levels of the employee's applicable rating(s) of record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency shall establish the amount of additional retention service credit provided for summary levels only in full years; the agency shall not establish additional retention service credit for summary levels below Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When establishing additional retention service credit for the summary levels at Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) and above, the agency shall establish at least 12 years, and no more than 20 years, additional retention service credit for a summary level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The agency may establish the same number of years additional retention service credit for more than one summary level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agency shall establish the same number of years additional retention service credit for all ratings of record with the same summary level in the same pattern of summary levels as set forth in Sec. 430.208(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The agency may establish a different number of years additional retention service credit for the same summary level in different patterns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In implementing paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall specify the number(s) of years additional retention service credit that it will establish for summary levels. This information shall be made readily available for review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The agency may apply paragraph (e) of this section only to ratings of record put on record on or after October 1, 1997. The agency shall establish the additional retention service credit for ratings of record put on record prior to that date in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
