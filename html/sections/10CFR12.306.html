                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the  basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant  or the NRC counsel, or on the adjudicative officer's own initiative, the  adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal  conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to  issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's  eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery  or an evidentiary hearing. Further proceedings shall be held only when  necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the  application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or  not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be  determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which  is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses  are sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request that the adjudicative officer order further  proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the  information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the  additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.</p>
