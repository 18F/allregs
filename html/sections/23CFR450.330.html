is required for the implementing agency to proceed with projects, except where the appropriated Federal funds available to the metropolitan planning area are significantly less than the authorized amounts or where there are significant shifting of projects between years. In this case, a revised ``agreed to'' list of projects shall be jointly developed by the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) if requested by the MPO, the State, or the public transportation operator(s). If the State or public transportation operator(s) wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of the TIP, the specific project selection procedures stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be used unless the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) jointly develop expedited project selection procedures to provide for the advancement of projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the TIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In metropolitan areas not designated as TMAs, projects to be implemented using title 23 U.S.C. funds (other than Federal Lands Highway program projects) or funds under title 49 U.S.C.

Projects on the NHS and projects funded under the Bridge and Interstate Maintenance programs shall be selected by the State in cooperation with the MPO, from the approved TIP. Federal Lands Highway program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 450.324(c) and Sec. 450.328(f), projects not included in the federally approved STIP shall not be eligible for funding with funds under title 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C.
