Paragraphs (c), (e)(1) and (e)(2), (g), and (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section set forth the Administrator's findings with respect to the 1-hour national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone that certain new and existing sources of emissions of nitrogen oxides (``NOX'') in certain States emit or would emit NOX in violation of the prohibition in section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on emissions in amounts that contribute significantly to nonattainment in certain States that submitted petitions in 1997-1998 addressing such NOX emissions under section 126 of the CAA. Paragraphs (d), (e)(3) and (e)(4), (f), and (h)(3) and (h)(4) of this section set forth the Administrator's affirmative technical determinations with respect to the 8-hour NAAQS for ozone that certain new and existing

sources of emissions of NOX in certain States emit or would emit NOX in violation of the prohibition in section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the CAA on emissions in amounts that contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, certain States that submitted petitions in 1997-1998 addressing such NOX emissions under section 126 of the CAA. (As used in this section, the term new source includes modified sources, as well.) Paragraph (i) of this section explains the circumstances under which the findings for sources in a specific State would be withdrawn. Paragraph (j) of this section sets forth the control requirements that apply to the sources of NOX emissions affected by the findings.
