------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Acres------------------------------------------------------------------------Total area of claim.............................................   10.50Area in conflict with survey No. 302............................    1.56Area in conflict with survey No. 948............................    2.33Area in conflict with Mountain Maid lode mining claim,              1.48</p><p class="depth3">unsurveyed.....................................................------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It does not follow that because mining surveys are required to exhibit all conflicts with prior surveys the area of conflict with prior surveys the area of conflict are to be excluded. The field notes and plat are made a part of the application for patent, and care should be taken that the description does not inadvertently exclude portions intended to be retained. The application for patent should state the portions to be excluded in express terms.</p>
