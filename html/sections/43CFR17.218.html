by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility which is altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date of this subpart, in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) Effective as of August 15, 1990, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.
