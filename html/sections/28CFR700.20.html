                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made. Unless a record is exempted from correction and amendment, an individual may submit a request for correction of a record pertaining to him. A request for correction must be made in writing. The request must identify the particular record in question, state the correction sought, and set forth the justification for the correction. Both the envelope and the request for correction itself must be clearly marked: ``Privacy Act Correction Request.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination. Within 10 working days of receiving a request for correction, the Office shall notify the requester whether his request will be granted or denied, in whole or in part. If the Office grants the request for correction in whole or in part, it shall advise the requester of his right to obtain a copy of the corrected record, in releasable form, upon request. If the Office denies the request for correction in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing of the denial. The notice of denial shall state the reason or reasons for the denial and advise the requester of his right to appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals.

An appeal to Independent Counsel shall be made in writing, shall set forth the specific item of information sought to be corrected, and shall include any documentation said to justify the correction. An appeal shall be addressed to the Office of Independent Counsel, suite 701 West, 555 Thirteenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20004.

Both the envelope and the letter of appeal itself must be clearly marked: ``Privacy Act Correction Appeal.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination on appeal. Independent Counsel, or his designee, shall decide all appeals from denials or requests to correct records. All such appeals shall be decided within 30 working days of receipt of the appeal, unless there is good cause to extend this period. If the denial of a request is affirmed on appeal, the requester shall be so notified in writing and advised of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reason or reasons the denial has been affirmed,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requester's right to file a Statement of Disagreement, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requester's right to obtain judicial review of the denial in the United States District Court for the judicial district in which the requester resides or has his principal place of business, the judicial district in which the record is located, or the District of Columbia.
If the denial is reversed on appeal, the requester shall be so notified and the request for correction shall be remanded to the Office for processing in accordance with the decision on appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Statements of disagreement. A requester whose appeal under this section is denied shall have the right to file a Statement of Disagreement with the Office of Independent Counsel, Suite 701 West, 555 Thirteenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20004, within 30 days of receiving notice of denial of his appeal. Statements of disagreement may not exceed one typed page per fact disputed. Statements exceeding this limit shall be returned to the requester for condensation. Upon receipt of a statement of disagreement under this section, Independent Counsel, or his designee, shall have the statement included in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and shall have the disputed record marked so as to indicate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a statement of disagreement has been filed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where in the system of records the statement of disagreement may be found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notices of correction or disagreement. Within 30 working days of the correction of a record, the Office shall advise all agencies to which it previously disclosed the record that the record has been corrected.
