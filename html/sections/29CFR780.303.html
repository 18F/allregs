                                Sec. 780.303  Exemption applicable on employee basis.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 13(a)(6)(A) exempts ``any employee employed in agriculture * * * by an employer * * *.'' It is clear from this language that it is the activities of the employee rather than those of his employer which determine the application of the exemption. In other words, the exemption applies only to employees who are engaged in agricultural activities. Thus some employees of the employer may be exempt while others may not. In any case the burden of effecting segregation between exempt and nonexempt work as between different groups of employees is upon the employer. For a more detailed discussion of what constitutes employment in agriculture, see subpart B of this part.


Sec. 780.304  ``Employed by an employer.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The employer may be an individual, a partnership, or a corporation. It is not necessary that the employer be a farmer as defined in Sec. 780.131. It is sufficient that he ``uses'' agricultural labor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In applying this exemption, one of the main criteria is the number of man-days of agricultural labor used by the employer. Section 13(a)(6)(A) provides that the exemption shall not apply to an employee employed in agriculture ``if such employee is employed by an employer who did not * * * use more than 500 man-days of agricultural labor * * *.'' From this language of the statute, the man-days of all agricultural workers, unless specifically excluded, of an employer whether he be the owner of a single farm, the owner of an enterprise consisting of several farms, a tenant farmer, an independent contractor, etc., are to be counted for purposes of section 13(a)(6)(A) whether they are employed at one place or several widely scattered places. For example if an employer owns and operates two farms, it is the total number of man-days used on both farms and not that used on each individual farm that determines whether he meets the 500 man-day test. Likewise independent

contractor who harvests crops on different farms during the harvesting season must total all the man-days of agricultural labor used on all such farms except those excludable under section 3(e) in determining whether he meets the 500 man-day test.


Sec. 780.305  500 man-day provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 3(u) of the Act defines man-day to mean ``any day during which an employee performs agricultural labor for not less than 1 hour.'' 500 man-days is approximately the equivalent of seven employees employed full-time in a calendar quarter. However, a farmer who hires temporary or part-time employees during part of the year, such as the harvesting season, may exceed the man-day test even though he may have only two or three full-time employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All of the employer's employees who are engaged in ``agricultural labor'' except those specifically excluded by section 3(e) (see Sec. 780.301) and those exempt under section 13(a)(14) (see subpart F of this part) must be counted in determining whether the 500 man-day test is met. This is true even though an employee may be exempt from the monetary provisions under another section of the Act. For example, a general manager of a farm may be an exempt executive employee under section 13(a)(1) or a sheepherder may meet the requirements of section 13(a)(6)(E). Regardless of those exemptions, their man-days of employment would be included in the man-day count of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A farmer whose crops are harvested by an independent contractor is considered to be a joint employer with the contractor who supplies the harvest hands if the farmer has the power to direct, control or supervise the work, or to determine the pay rates or method of payment for the harvest hands. (See Sec. 780.331.) Each employer must include the contractor's employees in his man-day count in determining whether his own man-day test is met. Each employer will be considered responsible for compliance with the minimum wage and child labor requirements of the Act with respect to the employees who are jointly employed.
