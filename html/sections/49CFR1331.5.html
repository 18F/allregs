Failure to do so will result in lack of immunity  for that activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The bureaus are required to maintain detailed minutes of all  meetings where immunized matters are discussed. The bureaus will be  subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing  violations of Board standards, and individual tariff publications will  be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for improprieties  in the rate bureau process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Absent Board approval, no other changes may be made in any  approved agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall  apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A general increase is a proposed general adjustment of  substantially all the rates published in a rate bureau's tariff(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A broad change in tariff structure modifies in a relatively non- uniform fashion the relationship between most rates published in a rate  bureau's tariff, and applies to a large area, either nationally or  regionally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An innovative fare will be determined on a case-by-case basis;  the Board will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular rate  proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an innovative  fare are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An experimental fare providing for transportation at the  passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A promotional fare generally has three characteristics:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limited duration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Attractive price or level of service quality; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.</p>
