                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Internal Revenue Service receives an  election under Sec. 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or a request for relief under  Sec. 1.6015-4, the Internal Revenue Service must send a notice to the  nonrequesting spouse's last known address that informs the nonrequesting  spouse of the requesting spouse's claim for relief. For further guidance  regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2 of  this chapter. The notice must provide the nonrequesting spouse with an  opportunity to submit any information that should be considered in  determining whether the requesting spouse should be granted relief from  joint and several liability. A nonrequesting spouse is not required to  submit information under this section. Upon the request of either  spouse, the Internal Revenue Service will share with one spouse the  information submitted by the other spouse, unless such information would  impair tax administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Internal Revenue Service must notify the nonrequesting  spouse of the Service's preliminary and final determinations with  respect to the requesting spouse's claim for relief under section 6015.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information submitted. The Internal Revenue Service will  consider all of the information (as relevant to each particular relief  provision) that the nonrequesting spouse submits in determining whether  relief from joint and several liability is appropriate, including  information relating to the following--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The legal status of the requesting and nonrequesting spouses'  marriage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent of the requesting spouse's knowledge of the erroneous  items or underpayment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent of the requesting spouse's knowledge or participation  in the family business or financial affairs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requesting spouse's education level;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which the requesting spouse benefitted from the  erroneous items;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any asset transfers between the spouses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any indication of fraud on the part of either spouse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Whether it would be inequitable, within the meaning of  Sec. Sec. 1.6015-2(d) and 1.6015-4, to hold the requesting spouse  jointly and severally liable for the outstanding liability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The allocation or ownership of items giving rise to the  deficiency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Anything else that may be relevant to the determination of  whether relief from joint and several liability should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of opportunity to participate. The failure to submit  information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section does not affect  the nonrequesting spouse's ability to seek relief from joint and several  liability for the same tax year. However, information that the  nonrequesting spouse submits pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section  is relevant in determining whether relief from joint and several  liability is appropriate for the nonrequesting spouse   should the nonrequesting spouse also submit an application for relief.
