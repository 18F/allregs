You shall either continuously monitor the stack gas moisture content using a method described in Sec. 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter or use an appropriate default moisture percentage. For coal, wood, and natural gas combustion, you may use the default moisture values specified in Sec. 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or values), using measurements made with EPA Method 4--Determination Of Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. Moisture data from the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of a CEMS may be used for this purpose. If this option is selected, the site-specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. For each site-specific default moisture percentage, at least nine Method 4 runs are required, except where the option to use moisture data from a RATA is selected, and the applicable regulation allows a single moisture determination to represent two or more RATA runs. In that case, you may base the site-specific moisture percentage on the number of moisture runs allowed by the RATA regulation. Calculate each site-specific default moisture value by taking the arithmetic average of the Method 4 runs. Each site-specific moisture default value shall be updated whenever the owner or operator believes the current value is non-representative, due to changes in unit or process operation, but in any event no less frequently than annually. Use the updated moisture value in the subsequent CO2 emissions calculations. For each unit operating hour, a moisture correction must be applied to Equation C-6 of this section as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.002
where:
CO2* = Hourly CO2 mass emission rate, corrected</p><p class="depth0">for moisture (metric tons/hr).CO2 = Hourly CO2 mass emission rate from Equation</p><p class="depth0">C-6 of this section, uncorrected (metric tons/hr).%H2O = Hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas (measured</p><p class="depth0">or default value, as appropriate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An oxygen (O2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F-14a or F-14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO2 emissions or CO2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F-14a and F-14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F-14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the

stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Each hourly CO2 mass emission rate from Equation C-6 or C-7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The hourly CO2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO2 mass emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO2 mass emissions, CO2 emissions shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A-2 and A-3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Calculate a CO2 mass emission rate (in metric tons/hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C-6 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the Equation C-6 nomenclature, replace the words ``Hourly average'' in the definitions of ``CCO2'' and ``Q'' with the words ``3-run average''. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO2 concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into modified Equation C-6. If CO2 is measured on a dry basis, a moisture correction of the calculated CO2 mass emission rate is required. Use Equation C-7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to make this correction; replace the word ``Hourly'' with the words ``3-run average'' in the equation nomenclature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG emissions calculations for the year of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the

stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO2 mass emission rate at each set point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Calculate the annual CO2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Finally, add the CO2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO2 mass emissions for the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter.
