                            <p class="depth0">The Chairman is the chief executive of the Conference. The Chairman  presides at meetings of the Council and at each plenary session of the  Conference. Among his powers is the authority to encourage Federal  agencies to adopt the recommendations of the Conference. The Chairman is  also authorized to make inquiries into matters he considers important  for Conference consideration, including matters proposed by individuals  inside or outside the Federal Government. The purpose of such inquiries  is not to review the results in particular cases, but rather to  determine whether the problems should be made the subject of Conference  study in the interests of developing fair and effective procedures for  such cases. Upon request of the head of an agency, the Chairman is  authorized to furnish assistance and advice on matters of administrative  procedure.   The Chairman may request agency heads to provide information needed by  the Conference, which information shall be supplied to the extent  permitted by law.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 302	303 [RESERVED]</p>
