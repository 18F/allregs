                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A portable tank constructed in accordance with a DOT  specification for which a test or inspection specified in this subpart  has become due, must be tested or inspected prior to being returned for  transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions requiring test and inspection of portable tanks.  Without regard to any other test or inspection requirements, a  Specification or UN portable tank must be tested and inspected in  accordance with this section prior to further use if any of the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The portable tank shows evidence of dents, corroded or abraded  areas, leakage, or any other condition that might render it unsafe for  transportation service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The portable tank has been in an accident and has been damaged  to an extent that may adversely affect its ability to retain the  hazardous material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The portable tank has been out of hazardous materials  transportation service for a period of one year or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The portable tank has been modified from its original design  specification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The portable tank is in an unsafe operating condition based on  the existence of probable cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Schedule for periodic inspections and tests. Each Specification  portable tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with the  following schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each IM or UN portable tank must be given an initial inspection  and test before being placed into service, a periodic inspection and  test at least once every 5 years, and an intermediate periodic  inspection and test at least every 2.5 years following the initial  inspection and the last 5 year periodic inspection and test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Specification 51 portable tank must be given a periodic  inspection and test at least once every five years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each Specification 56 or 57 portable tank must be given a  periodic inspection and test at least once every 2.5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each Specification 60 portable tank must be given a periodic  inspection and test at the end of the first 4-year period after the  original test; at least once every 2 years thereafter up to a total of  12 years of service; and at least once annually thereafter. Retesting is  not required on a rubber-lined tank except before each relining.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Intermediate periodic inspection and test. For IM and UN  portable tanks the intermediate 2.5 year periodic inspection and test  must include at least an internal and external examination of the  portable tank and its fittings taking into account the hazardous  materials intended to be transported; a leakage test; and a test of the  satisfactory operation of all service equipment. Sheathing, thermal  insulation, etc. need only be removed to the extent required for  reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. For portable  tanks intended for the transportation of a single hazardous material,  the internal examination may be waived if it is leakage tested in  accordance with the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section prior to  each filling, or if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable  tanks used for dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases  that are not fitted with inspection openings are excepted from the  internal inspection requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Periodic inspection and test. The 5 year periodic inspection and  test must include an internal and external examination and, unless  excepted, a pressure test as specified in this section. Sheathing,  thermal insulation, etc. need only to be removed to the extent required  for reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. Except for  DOT Specification 56 and 57 portable tanks, reclosing pressure relief  devices must be removed from the tank and tested separately unless they  can be tested while installed on the portable tank. For portable tanks  where the shell and equipment have been pressure-tested separately,  after assembly they must be subjected together to a leakage test and  effectively tested and inspected for corrosion. Portable tanks used for  the transportation of refrigerated, liquefied gases are excepted from  the requirement for internal inspection and the hydraulic pressure test  during the 5-year periodic inspection and test, if the portable tanks  were pressure tested to a minimum test pressure of 1.3 times the design  pressure using an inert gas as prescribed in Sec. 178.338-16(a) and (b)  of this subchapter before putting the portable tank into service  initially and after any exceptional inspections and tests specified in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exceptional inspection and test. The exceptional inspection and  test is necessary when a portable tank shows evidence of damaged or  corroded areas, or leakage, or other conditions that indicate a  deficiency that could affect the integrity of the portable tank. The  extent of the exceptional inspection and test must depend on the amount  of damage or deterioration of the portable tank. It must include at  least the inspection and a pressure test according to paragraph (e) of  this section. Pressure relief devices need not be tested or replaced  unless there is reason to believe the relief devices have been affected  by the damage or deterioration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Internal and external examination. The internal and external  examinations must ensure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The shell is inspected for pitting, corrosion, or abrasions,  dents, distortions, defects in welds or any other conditions, including  leakage, that might render the portable tank unsafe for transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The piping, valves, and gaskets are inspected for corroded  areas, defects, and other conditions, including leakage, that might  render the portable tank unsafe for filling, discharge or  transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Devices for tightening manhole covers are operative and there is  no leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Missing or loose bolts or nuts on any flanged connection or  blank flange are replaced or tightened;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All emergency devices and valves are free from corrosion,  distortion and any damage or defect that could prevent their normal  operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop-valves must be  operated to demonstrate proper operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Required markings on the portable tank are legible and in  accordance with the applicable requirements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The framework, the supports and the arrangements for lifting the  portable tank are in satisfactory condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pressure test procedures for specification 51, 56, 57, 60, IM or  UN portable tanks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each Specification 57 portable tank must be leak  tested by a minimum sustained air pressure of at least 3 psig applied to  the entire tank. Each Specification 51 or 56 portable tank must be  tested by a minimum pressure (air or hydrostatic) of at least 2 psig or  at least one and one-half times the design pressure (maximum allowable  working pressure, or re-rated pressure) of the tank, whichever is  greater. The leakage test for portable tanks used for refrigerated  liquefied gas must be performed at 90% of MAWP. Leakage tests for all  other portable tanks must be at a pressure of at least 25% of MAWP.  During each air pressure test, the entire surface of all joints under  pressure must be coated with or immersed in a solution of soap and  water, heavy oil, or other material suitable for the purpose of  detecting leaks. The pressure must be held for a period of time  sufficiently long to assure detection of leaks, but in no case less than  five minutes. During the air or hydrostatic test, relief devices may be  removed, but all the closure fittings must be in place and the relief  device openings plugged. Lagging need not be removed from a lagged tank  if it is possible to maintain the required test pressure at constant  temperature with the tank disconnected from the source of pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Specification 60 portable tank must be retested by  completely filling the tank with water or other liquid having a similar  viscosity, the temperature of the liquid must not exceed 37.7 C (100  F) during the test, and applying a pressure of 60 psig. The portable  tank must be capable of holding the prescribed pressure for at least 10  minutes without leakage, evidence of impending failure, or failure. All  closures shall be in place while the test is made and the pressure shall  be gauged at the top of the tank. Safety devices and/or vents shall be  plugged during this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each Specification IM or UN portable tank, except for UN  portable tanks used for non-refrigerated and refrigerated liquefied  gases, and all piping, valves and accessories, except pressure relief  devices, must be hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of  similar density and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 150% of its  maximum allowable working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the  transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied gases must be  hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of similar density  and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 130% of its maximum allowable  working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the transportation of  refrigerated liquefied gases may be tested hydrostatically or  pneumatically using an inert gas to a pressure not less than 1.3 times  the design pressure. For pneumatic testing, due regard for protection of  all personnel must be taken because of the potential hazard involved in  such a test. The pneumatic test pressure in the portable tank must be  reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test  pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of  approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test  pressure has been reached. The pressure must then be reduced to a value  equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time  to permit inspection of the portable tank for leaks. The minimum test  pressure for a portable tank is determined on the basis of the hazardous  materials that are intended to be transported in the portable tanks. For  liquid, solid and non-refrigerated liquefied gases, the minimum test  pressure for specific hazardous materials are specified in the  applicable T Codes assigned to a particular hazardous material in the  Sec. 172.101 Table of this subchapter. While under pressure the tank  shall be inspected for leakage, distortion, or any other condition which  might render the tank unsafe for service. A portable tank fails to meet  the requirements of the pressure test if, during the test, there is  permanent distortion of the tank exceeding that permitted by the  applicable specification; if there is any leakage; or if there are any  deficiencies that would render the portable tank unsafe for  transportation. Any portable tank that fails must be rejected and may  not be used   again for the transportation of a hazardous material unless the tank is  adequately repaired, and, thereafter, a successful test is conducted in  accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. An approval agency  shall witness the hydrostatic or pneumatic test. Any damage or  deficiency that might render the portable tank unsafe for service shall  be repaired to the satisfaction of the witnessing approval agency. The  repaired tank must be retested to the original pressure test  requirements. Upon successful completion of the hydrostatic or pneumatic  test, as applicable, the witnessing approval agency shall apply its  name, identifying mark or identifying number in accordance with  paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rejection criteria. When evidence of any unsafe condition is  discovered, the portable tank may not be returned to service until it  has been repaired and the pressure test is repeated and passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Repair. The repair of a portable tank is authorized, provided  such repairs are made in accordance with the requirements prescribed in  the specification for the tank's original design and construction. In  addition to any other provisions of the specification, no portable tank  may be repaired so as to cause leakage or cracks or so as to increase  the likelihood of leakage or cracks near areas of stress concentration  due to cooling metal shrinkage in welding operations, sharp fillets,  reversal of stresses, or otherwise. No field welding may be done except  to non-pressure parts. Any cutting, burning or welding operations on the  shell of an IM or UN portable tank must be done with the approval of the  approval agency and be done in accordance with the requirements of this  subchapter, taking into account the pressure vessel code used for the  construction of the shell. A pressure test to the original test pressure  must be performed after the work is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Inspection and test markings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each IM or UN portable tank  must be durably and legibly marked, in English, with the date (month and  year) of the last pressure test, the identification markings of the  approval agency witnessing the test, when required, and the date of the  last visual inspection. The marking must be placed on or near the metal  identification plate, in letters and numerals of not less than 3 mm  (0.118 inches) high when on the metal identification plate, and 12 mm  (0.47 inches) high when on the portable tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Specification DOT 51, 56, 57 or 60 portable tank must be  durably and legibly marked, in English, with the date (month and year)  of the most recent periodic retest. The marking must be placed on or  near the metal certification plate and must be in accordance with  Sec. 178.3 of this subchapter. The letters and numerals must not be less  than 3 mm (0.118 inches) high when on the metal certification plate, and  12 mm (0.47 inches) high when on the portable tank, except that a  portable tank manufactured under a previously authorized specification  may continue to be marked with smaller markings if originally authorized  under that specification (for example, DOT Specification 57 portable  tanks).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Record retention. The owner of each portable tank or his  authorized agent shall retain a written record of the date and results  of all required inspections and tests, including an ASME manufacturer's  date report, if applicable, and the name and address of the person  performing the inspection or test, in accordance with the applicable  specification. The manufacturer's data report, including a  certificate(s) signed by the manufacturer, and the authorized design  approval agency, as applicable, indicating compliance with the  applicable specification of the portable tank, must be retained in the  files of the owner, or his authorized agent, during the time that such  portable tank is used for such service, except for Specifications 56 and  57 portable tanks.

An operator of a cargo tank equipped with a calibrated meter may  check the internal self-closing stop valve for leakage through the valve  seat using the meter as a flow measurement indicator. The test is  initiated by starting the delivery process or returning product to the  cargo tank through the delivery system. This may be performed at an  idle. After the flow is established, the operator closes the internal  self-closing stop valve and monitors the meter flow. The meter flow must  stop within 30 seconds with no meter creep within 5 seconds after the  meter stops.</p><p class="depth2">2. On pump-actuated pressure differential internal self-closing stop  valves, the valve must be closed with the remote actuator to assure that  it is functioning. On other types of internal self-closing stop valves,  the valve(s) may be closed using either the normal valve control or the  discharge control system (e.g., remote).</p><p class="depth2">3.
