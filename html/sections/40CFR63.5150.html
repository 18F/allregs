                            <p class="depth0">Table 1 to Sec. 63.5150--Control Device Monitoring Requirements Index ------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you operate a coil coating line</p><p class="depth0">and have the following:                  Then you must: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1. Control device.................  Monitor control device operating</p><p class="depth0">parameters (Sec. 63.5150(a)(3)). 2. Capture system.................  Monitor capture system operating</p><p class="depth0">parameters (Sec. 63.5150(a)(4)). 3. Intermittently controllable      Monitor parameters related to</p><p class="depth0">work station.                       possible exhaust flow through any</p><p class="depth0">bypass to a control device (Sec.</p><p class="depth0">63.5150(a)(1)). 4. Continuous emission monitors...  Operate continuous emission monitors</p><p class="depth0">and perform a quarterly audit (Sec.</p><p class="depth0">63.5150(a)(2)). ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section  for each curing oven associated with these work stations to monitor for  potential bypass of the control device:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain,  and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow  control position indicator that provides a record indicating whether the  exhaust stream from the curing oven is directed to the control device or  is diverted from the control device. The time and flow control position  must be recorded at least once per   hour, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow  control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any  bypass line that could divert the exhaust stream away from the control  device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line  valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type  configuration when the control device is in operation; a visual  inspection of the seal or closure mechanism will be performed at least  once every month to ensure that the valve or damper is maintained in the  closed position, and the exhaust stream is not diverted through the  bypass line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Valve closure continuous monitoring. Ensure that any bypass  line valve or damper is in the closed position through continuous  monitoring of valve position when the control device is in operation.  The monitoring system must be inspected at least once every month to  verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in  which the coil coating line is stopped when flow is diverted away from  the control device to any bypass line when the control device is in  operation. The automatic shutdown system must be inspected at least once  every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut  down operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> through continuous emission monitoring of a control  device, you must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain continuous  emission monitors to measure the total organic volatile matter  concentration at both the control device inlet and outlet, and you must  continuously monitor flow rate. If you are demonstrating continuous  compliance with the outlet organic HAP concentration limit in Sec.  63.5120(a)(3), you must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a  continuous emission monitor to measure the total organic volatile matter  concentration at the control device outlet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All CEMS must comply with performance specification 8 or 9 of 40  CFR part 60, appendix B, as appropriate for the detection principle you  choose. The requirements of 40 CFR part 60, procedure 1, appendix F must  also be followed. In conducting the quarterly audits of the monitors as  required by procedure 1, appendix F, you must use compounds  representative of the gaseous emission stream being controlled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, each CEMS and each flow  rate monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation  (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute  period. Information which must be determined for recordkeeping purposes,  as required by Sec. 63.5190(a)(1)(i) includes:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hourly average of all recorded readings;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The daily average of all recorded readings for each operating  day; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The monthly average for each month during the semiannual  reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate temperature monitoring  equipment according to manufacturer's specifications. The calibration of  the chart recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator must be  verified every 3 months; or the chart recorder, data logger, or  temperature indicator must be replaced. You must replace the equipment  either if you choose not to perform the calibration, or if the equipment  cannot be calibrated properly. Each temperature monitoring device must  be equipped with a continuous recorder. The device must have an accuracy  of 1 percent of the temperature being monitored in  degrees Celsius, or 1 [deg]Celsius, whichever is  greater.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer, to demonstrate  continuous compliance with the operating limit established according to  Sec. 63.5160(d)(3)(i), you must install the thermocouple or temperature  sensor in   the combustion chamber at a location in the combustion zone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a catalytic oxidizer, if you are demonstrating continuous  compliance with the operating limit established according to Sec.  63.5160(d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B), then you must install the thermocouples or  temperature sensors in the vent stream at the nearest feasible point to  the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Calculate the temperature  difference across the catalyst. If you are demonstrating continuous  compliance with the operating limit established according to Sec.  63.5160(d)(3)(ii)(C) and (D), then you must install the thermocouple or  temperature sensor in the vent stream at the nearest feasible point to  the inlet of the catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(iii)</em> of this section. You must make  the monitoring plan available for inspection by the permitting authority  upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The monitoring plan must identify the operating parameter to be  monitored to ensure that the capture efficiency measured during the  initial compliance test is maintained, explain why this parameter is  appropriate for demonstrating ongoing compliance, and identify the  specific monitoring procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan also must specify operating limits at the capture  system operating parameter value, or range of values, that demonstrates  compliance with the standards in Sec. 63.5120. The operating limits  must represent the conditions indicative of proper operation and  maintenance of the capture system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must conduct monitoring in accordance with the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any deviation from the required operating parameters which are  monitored in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section,  unless otherwise excused, will be considered a deviation from the  operating limit.</p>
