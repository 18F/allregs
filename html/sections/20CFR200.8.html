                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to establish  specific procedures necessary for compliance with section 12(d) of the  Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which is incorporated into the  Railroad Retirement Act by section 7(b)(3) of that Act. Except as  otherwise indicated in this section, these regulations apply to all  information obtained by the Railroad Retirement Board in connection with  the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad  Unemployment Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--Agency. The term agency refers to the Railroad  Retirement Board, an independent agency in the executive branch of the  United States Government.</p><p class="depth2">Applicant. The term applicant means a person who signs an  application for an annuity or lump-sum payment or unemployment benefits  or sickness benefits for himself or herself or for some other person.</p><p class="depth2">Beneficiary. The term beneficiary refers to an individual to whom a  benefit is payable under either the Railroad Retirement Act or the  Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth2">Board. The term Board refers to the three-member governing body of  the Railroad Retirement Board.</p><p class="depth2">Document. The term document includes correspondence, applications,  claims, reports, records, memoranda and any other materials or data  used, prepared, received or transmitted to, from, by or for the agency  in connection with the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act or  the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth2">Information. The term information means any non-medical document or  data which is obtained by the agency in the administration of the  Railroad Retirement Act and/or the Railroad   Unemployment Insurance Act. Information does not include the fact of  entitlement to or the amount of a benefit under either of these Acts.  Medical records are subject to the disclosure provisions set out in  Sec. 200.5(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Testify and testimony. The terms testify and testimony include both  in-person oral statements before a court or a legislative or  administrative body and statements made in the form of depositions,  interrogatories, declarations, affidavits or other means of formal  participation in such proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise authorized by this section,  information shall not be produced, disclosed, delivered or open to  inspection in any manner revealing the identity of an employee,  applicant or beneficiary unless the Board or its authorized designee  finds that such production, disclosure, delivery, or inspection is  clearly in furtherance of the interest of the employee, applicant or  beneficiary or of the estate of such employee, applicant, or  beneficiary. Where no such finding is made, no information shall be  released except in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 200.5 of this  part, unless release of such information is required by a law determined  to supersede this general rule. In addition, regardless of whether or  not such finding can be made, information which is compiled in  anticipation of a civil or criminal action or proceeding against an  applicant or beneficiary may not be released under this general rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpoenas--statement of policy and general rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is the  policy of the Board to provide information, data, and records to non- Federal litigants to the same extent and in the same manner that they  are available to the general public. The availability of Board employees  to testify before state and local courts and administrative and  legislative bodies, as well as in Federal court and administrative  proceedings which involve non-Federal litigants, concerning information  acquired in the course of performing their official duties or because of  the employee's official capacity, is governed by the Board's policy of  maintaining strict impartiality with respect to private litigants and  minimizing the disruption of an employee's official duties. Thus, the  Board may refuse to make an employee available for testimony under this  paragraph or paragraph (e) or (f) of this section if it determines that  the information sought is available other than through testimony and  where making such employee available would cause disruption of agency  operations. However, this paragraph does not apply to any civil or  criminal proceeding where the United States, the Railroad Retirement  Board, or any other Federal agency is a party; to Congressional requests  or subpoenas for testimony; to consultative services and technical  assistance provided by the Board or the agency in carrying out its  normal program activities; to employees serving as expert witnesses in  connection with professional and consultative services rendered as  approved outside activities (in cases where employees are providing such  outside services, they must state for the record that the testimony  represents their own views and does not necessarily represent the  official position of the agency); or to employees making appearances in  their private capacity in legal or administrative proceedings that do  not relate to the official business of the agency (such as cases arising  out of traffic accidents, crimes, domestic relations, etc.) and not  involving professional and consultative services as described above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No officer, agent, or employee of the agency is authorized to  accept or receive service of subpoenas, summons, or other judicial  process addressed to the Board or to the agency except as the Board may  from time to time delegate such authority by power of attorney. The  Board has issued such power of attorney to the Deputy General Counsel of  the agency and to no one else.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event the production, disclosure, or delivery of any  information is called for on behalf of the United States or the agency,  such information shall be produced, disclosed, or delivered only upon  and pursuant to the advice of the Deputy General Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When any member, officer, agent, or employee of the agency is  served with a subpoena to produce, disclose, deliver, or furnish any  information, he   or she shall immediately notify the Deputy General Counsel of the fact  of the service of such subpoena. Unless otherwise ordered by the Deputy  General Counsel or his or her designee, he or she shall appear in  response to the subpoena and respectfully decline to produce, disclose,  deliver, or furnish the information, basing such refusal upon the  authority of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subpoena duces tecum. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When any document is sought from the  agency by a subpoena duces tecum or other judicial order issued to the  agency by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding wherein such  document is relevant, a copy of such document, certified by the  Secretary to the Board to be a true copy, may be produced, disclosed, or  delivered by the agency if, in the judgment of the Board or its  designee, such production is clearly in furtherance of the interest of  the employee, applicant, or beneficiary to whom the document pertains,  or is clearly in furtherance of the interest of the estate of such  employee, applicant, or beneficiary, and such document does not consist  of or include a report of medical information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the production, diclosure, or delivery of any document  described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section would not be permitted  under the standards therein set forth, no member, officer, agent, or  employee of the agency shall make any disclosure of or testify with  respect to such document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requests for voluntary testimony. All requests for testimony by  a Board employee in his or her official capacity must be in writing and  directed to the Deputy General Counsel. They shall state the nature of  the requested testimony, why the information is not available by any  other means, and the reasons, if any, why the testimony would be in the  interest of the Board or the Federal government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Authorized release of information. Subject to the limitation  expressed in paragraph (h) of this section, disclosure of documents and  information is hereby authorized, in such manner as the Board may by  instructions prescribe, in the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To any employer, employee, applicant, or prospective applicant  for an annuity or death benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act of  1974, or his or

under the Railroad Retirement Act, or to his or her  duly authorized representative, as to the amount payable as such death  benefits or accrued annuities, and the name of the person or persons  determined by the agency to be the beneficiary, or beneficiaries,  thereof, if such applicant or prospective applicant purports to have a  valid reason for believing himself or herself to be, in whole or in  part, the beneficiary thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To any officer or employee of the United States lawfully charged  with the administration of any Federal law concerning taxes imposed with  respect to amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and  the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and the name of the person or  persons to whom such amount was payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To any officer or employee of any state of the United States  lawfully charged with the administration of any law of such state  concerning unemployment compensation, as to the amounts payable to  payees or beneficiaries under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and  the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To any court of competent jurisdiction in which proceedings are  pending which relate to the care of the person or estate of an  incompetent individual, as to amounts payable under the Railroad  Retirement Act to such incompetent individual, but only for the purpose  of such proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To parties involved in litigation, including an action with  respect to child support, alimony, or marital property, the amount of  any actual or estimated benefit payable under the Railroad Retirement  Act or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, where such amount or  estimated amount is relevant to that litigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To any employer, as to the monthly amount of any retirement  annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or benefit under the  Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to which a present or former  employee of that employer is entitled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> To any governmental welfare agency, information about the  receipt of benefits and eligibility for benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> To any law enforcement agency, information necessary to  investigate or prosecute criminal activity in connection with claims for  benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Unemployment  Insurance Act, or any other Act the Board may be authorized to  administer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> To any consular official, other than a consular officer of a  country to which United States Treasury checks and warrants may not be  sent, acting in behalf of a compatriot who has claimed benefits under  the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act,  information that is pertinent to the claim and that the applicant  himself could have upon his or her own request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No document and no information acquired solely by reason of any  agreement, arrangement, contract, or request by or on behalf of the  agency, relating to the gathering, preparation, receipt or transmittal  of documents or information to, from or for the agency, which is by  virtue of such agreement, arrangement, contract, or request in the  possession of any person other than an employee of the agency, shall be  produced, reproduced, or duplicated, disclosed or delivered by any  person to any other person or tribunal (other than the agency or an  employee thereof, or the person to whom the document or information  pertains), whether in response to a subpoena or otherwise, except with  the consent of the Board or its designee. Any person, upon receipt of  any request, subpoena, or order calling for the production, disclosure,  or delivery of such document or information shall notify the Board or  its designee of the request, subpoena, or order and shall take no  further action except upon advice of the Board or its designee. Unless  consent of the Board or its designee is given, the person shall  respectfully decline to comply with the request, subpoena or order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no  disclosure of information may be made by the Board or any member,  officer, agent, or employee of the agency, if the disclosure of such  information is prohibited by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The Deputy General Counsel or his designee will request the  assistance of the Department of Justice where necessary to represent the  interests of the agency and its employees under this section.
