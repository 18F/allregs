The  application for a hearing subpoena must also contain a proposed subpoena  specifying the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence  from any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the  District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law at any designated  place where the hearing is being conducted. The party making the  application shall serve a copy of the application and the proposed  subpoena on every other party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party may apply for a hearing subpoena at any time before the  commencement of a hearing. During a hearing, a party may make an  application for a subpoena orally on the record before the  administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any hearing  subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law  judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis  for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are  unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he  or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified  form upon any conditions consistent with this subpart. Upon issuance by  the administrative law judge, the party making the application shall  serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena and on each  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion to quash or modify. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person to whom a hearing  subpoena is directed or any party may file a motion to quash or modify  the subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or  modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on each party  and on the person named in the subpoena. Any party may respond to the  motion within ten days of service of the motion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any motion to quash or modify a hearing subpoena must be filed  prior to the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, but not more  than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena upon the movant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.
