                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interests to which section 4943(c)(5) applies--(1) In general.  Section 4943(c)(5) provides that section 4943(c)(4) (other than the 20- year first phase holding period) applies to an interest in a business  enterprise acquired after May 26, 1969 by a private foundation under the  terms of a trust which was irrevocable on May 26, 1969, or under the  terms of a will executed on or before May 26, 1969, which were in effect  on May 26, 1969, and at all times thereafter, as if such interest were  held on May 26, 1969. However the first phase holding period prescribed  by Sec. 53.4943-4(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (ii) or (iii) shall commence for such an  interest on the date of distribution to the foundation. Unlike section  4943(c)(4) and Sec. 53.4943-4, section 4943(c)(5) and this section  treat only the interest so acquired (and not the entire interest held by  the foundation in such enterprise on the date of distribution) as held  by a disqualified person during a first phase holding period. (See,  however, section 4943(c)(6) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 53.4943-6 for  the treatment of other holdings of the foundation in the same enterprise  if an interest to which section 4943(c)(5) applies is acquired from a  person who was not a disqualified person prior to the acquisition.) In  addition, section 4943(c)(5) and this section shall not apply if after  the acquisition of such an interest the foundation would not have excess  business holdings (determined without regard to section 4943(c) (4),  (5), or (6)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After-acquired interests. Section 4943(c)(5) and this section  shall not apply to any interest acquired after May 26, 1969, by an  estate or trust, other than by reason of the death of the decedent. For  example, where a foundation is a residuary beneficiary under the terms  of a will executed before May 26, 1969, and the residue of the estate  consists of cash, then stock subsequently purchased with cash for  distribution to the foundation will not be treated as an interest  acquired under the terms of a will executed on or before May 26, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain revocable trusts. If an interest in a business  enterprise actually passes to a private foundation under a trust which  would have met the tests referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section  but for the fact that the trust was revocable (even though it was not in  fact revoked) and such interest would have passed to such foundation  under a will that meets those tests but for the fact that the grantor  died without having revoked the trust, then for purposes of section  4943(c)(5) and this section, such an interest shall be treated as having  been acquired by the foundation under the will.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Modification of will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section  4943(c)(5) and this section, an amendment or republication of a will  which was executed on or before May 26, 1969, does not prevent any  interest in a business enterprise which was to pass under the terms  (which were in effect on May 26, 1969, and at all times there- after) of  such will from being treated as a present holding under section 4943(c)  (4) or (5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Solely because there is a reduction in the interest in the  business enterprise which the foundation was to receive under the terms  of the will (for example, if the foundation is to receive the residuary  estate, and if one class of stock is disposed of by the decedent during  his lifetime or by a subsequent codicil);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Solely because such amendment or republication is necessary in  order to comply with section 508(e) and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Solely because there is a change in the executor of the will; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Solely because of any other change which does not otherwise  change the rights of the foundation with respect to such interest in the  business enterprise.  However, if under such amendment or republication there is an increase  in the interest in the business enterprise which the foundation was to  receive under the terms of the will in effect on May 26, 1969, such  increase shall not be treated as present holdings under section 4943(c)  (4) or (5). Under such circumstances the interest which would have been  acquired before such increase shall remain present holdings. See section  4943(c)(6) and Sec. 53.4943-6 with respect to the treatment of such  increase in holdings of a private foundation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(4) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On May 9, 1985, A modifies by codicil his will which was  in effect on May 26, 1969, and was unchanged until such modification.  The purpose of the codicil was, in the event of A's death, to increase  the number of shares in X Corporation that would pass to the W  foundation from 70 percent of all the voting power and value to 80  percent. Under these facts, if A dies without further modifying the  terms of the will which apply to W's interest in X, section 4943(c)(5)  will apply to 70 percent of the X voting power and value and section  4943(c)(6) will apply to 10 percent of the X voting power and value,  since 10 percent of the X voting power and value would not pass under a  provision of the will which was in effect on May 26, 1969, and at all  times thereafter. Accordingly, if the stock is distributed to W on July  6, 1988, then, assuming that on May 26, 1969, W and all disqualified  persons owned less than 75% of the voting stock in X, an amount of such  stock representing 70 percent of X voting power and value shall be  treated as held by a disqualified person through July 5, 1998, and an  amount of such stock representing 10 percent of X voting power and value  shall be treated as held by a disqualified person through July 5, 1993.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in Example (1), except that  the sole purpose of the codicil was to change the executor of the will.  Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, such codicil will not prevent  the X voting stock which was bequeathed to W from being treated as held  by a disqualified person through July 5, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Holding periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An interest to which section  4943(c)(5) applies shall be entitled to a 15-year holding period  starting on the date of distribution only if the interests actually or  constructively owned by a private foundation and all disqualified  persons on May 26, 1969, in a business enterprise exceed 75 percent of  the voting stock (or of the profits or beneficial interest) or 75  percent of the value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock  (or of the profits and capital interest) in such enterprise. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, interests held by the foundation on  May 26, 1969, shall be deemed to include an interest to which section  4943(c)(5) applies and which has been acquired (on or before the date of  distribution for the interest in question) from a person who was not a  disqualified person on May 26, 1969. Therefore, if under the terms of a  will in effect on May 26, 1969, and at all times thereafter, a private  foundation is created on July 1, 1975, and receives 76 percent of the  voting stock of a business enterprise on that date, such stock shall be  treated as held by a disqualified person until June 30, 1990. Any  interest to which section 4943(c)(5) applies but which is not entitled  to a 15-year holding period shall be entitled to a 10-year holding  period starting on the date of distribution. For purposes of this  paragraph the date of distribution shall be deemed to occur no later  than the date on which the trust or estate is considered to be  terminated under Sec. 1.641(b)-(3) of this chapter (Income Tax  Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Constructive ownership prior to date of distribution. To the  extent that an interest to which section 4943(c)(5) applies is  constructively held by a private foundation under section 4943(d)(1) and  Sec. 53.4943-8 prior to the date of distribution, it shall be treated  as held by a disqualified person prior to such date by reason of section  4943(c)(5). In addition, in the case of a foundation's interest in a  trust which was irrevocable on May 26, 1969, and to which both sections  4943 (c)(4) and (c)(5) apply, the first phase holding period for such  interest shall end with whichever such period under section 4943(c) (4)  or (5) ends later. For example, if under the terms of such a trust, 96  percent of the   voting stock in a business enterprise was constructively held by a  private foundation on May 26, 1969, and was distributed to such  foundation on June 30, 1970, such interest is entitled to a 20-year  holding period beginning on May 26, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Permitted holdings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The permitted holdings of a  private foundation which has an interest in a business enterprise to  which section 4943(c)(5) applies shall be determined in accordance with  the rules of paragraph (d) of Sec. 53.4943-4. The levels referred to in  such paragraph shall be adjusted to take into account the acquisition of  such an interest as if it were treated as held by a disqualified person  from May 26, 1969, until the date of acquisition. See also Sec.  53.4943-6(b)(2) for the special rule for interests held by a private  foundation at the time it acquires a section 4943(c)(5) interest from a  nondisqualified person. Thus, for example, if on June 30, 1975, the  disqualified person voting level and the substituted combined voting  level in corporation X with respect to foundation F are 45 percent, and  a nondisqualified person's 10 percent voting interest in X is acquired  by F on July 1, 1975, in a transaction to which section 4943(c)(5)  applies, the above-mentioned levels shall be increased to 55 and 50  percent respectively, on July 1, 1975. However, if such interest had  been acquired from a person who was a disqualified person on May 26,  1969, rather than from a nondisqualified person, no adjustments in such  levels would have taken place on July 1, 1975. In such a case, though,  at the beginning of the second phase on July 1, 1985, the foundation  voting level would be increased by 10 percent, and the disqualified  person voting level decreased by 10 percent (assuming that none of the  acquired stock had been disposed of prior to such date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate phases. The phases for each interest to which section  4943(c)(5) applies start independently from those for any other interest  of the foundation in the same enterprise to which section 4943(c) (4) or  (5) applies. Therefore, until an interest enters its own second phase,  the 25 percent limit described in paragraph (d)(5) of Sec. 53.4943-4  shall not apply to such interest since such interest (and any  subsequently acquired section 4943(c)(5) interest in the first phase) is  still treated as held by a disqualified person for purposes of that 25  percent limit. In addition, if such an interest enters its second phase  and at such time all disqualified persons together do not have holdings  in excess of 2 percent of the voting stock in the same business  enterprise, then the 25 percent limit of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i) shall  not then apply to such interest, even though such limit may have been  applicable to an interest with an earlier second phase. Moreover, the 35  percent limit of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(ii) shall cause only interests  which have entered the third phase to become excess business holdings,  taking into account, however, interests in prior phases in determining  the holdings subject to such limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples: (After each example is a chart setting forth the  chronological changes in the various levels referred to in paragraph (d)  of Sec. 53.4943-4.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On May 26, 1969, F, a private foundation, owns no stock  in M Corporation, and A, a disqualified person owns 40 percent of the  voting stock (voting power and value) in M. A dies on May 1, 1971,  leaving 30 percent of the voting stock in M to F and leaving the other  10 percent to a disqualified person. Distribution is made on June 1,  1972, and assume that section 4943(c)(5) applies. No transactions in the  stock of M, other than those described in this example, occur. On May  26, 1969, the substituted combined voting level is 40 percent, the  disqualified person voting level is deemed to be 40 percent, and the  permitted holdings by F in M is deemed to be 0 percent (40%-40%). On May  1, 1971 (the date that F acquired the M stock by reason of its  constructive ownership of A's estate), the various levels remain  unchanged. On May 1, 1971, the 30 percent interest is treated as held by  a disqualified person for a period extending through May 31, 1982. On  June 1, 1981, F disposes of 6 percent of the voting stock to a  nondisqualified person. The substituted combined voting level and the  disqualified person voting level thereby are reduced to 34 percent (40%- 6%) each. On June 1, 1982, at the beginning of the second phase, the  foundation voting level increases to 24 percent (30%-6%) and the  disqualified person voting level is reduced to 10 percent (34%-10%). The  substituted combined voting level as of June 1, 1982, remains at 34  percent. The permitted holdings as of such date are 24 percent (34%- 10%). If F had not disposed of any holdings prior to June 1, 1982,   F's permitted holdings would have been 25 percent, the lesser of 25  percent (the limitation of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i)), or 30 percent  (40%-10%). Since on such date the 30 percent interest would no longer  have been treated as held by a disqualified person, F would have had  excess business holdings of 5 percent (30%-25%).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Interest</p><p class="depth0">treated as                 Foundation  Substituted  Disqualified</p><p class="depth0">F owns      held by    Disqualified    voting      combined      person     Permitted</p><p class="depth0">Date                  (percent)  disqualified   persons own     level       voting    voting level   holdings          Comments</p><p class="depth0">person       (percent)    (percent)     level       (percent)   (percent)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(percent)</em>                              (percent) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- May 26, 1969.........................          0            0            40            0          40            40           0 May 1, 1971..........................        +30          +30           -30   ..........  ...........  ............  .........

On May 26, 1969, the  substituted combined voting level and the disqualified person voting  levels are each 50 percent and the permitted holdings are 0 percent  (50%-50%). On May 1, 1971, and June 1, 1972, these levels remain  unchanged. On May 1, 1971, the 15 percent interest is treated as held by  a disqualified person for a period extending through May 31, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of Sec. 53.4943-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On August 1, 1981, F sells 16 percent of the N stock to a  nondisqualified person, thereby reducing the foundation voting level to  8 percent (24%-16%), and reducing the substituted combined voting level  to 28 percent (44%-16%). The disqualified person voting level remains at  20 percent. On June 1, 1982, at the beginning of the second phase for  F's holdings acquired by will, the substituted combined voting level is  still 28 percent, the foundation voting level is 23 percent (8%+15%),  the disqualified person voting level is 5 percent (20%-15%), and the  permitted holdings are 23 percent (28%-5%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If F had not disposed of the 6 percent on July 1, 1978, then on  May 26, 1979, at the beginning of the second phase for F's 1969  holdings, F's permitted holdings would have been 25 percent, the lesser  of 25 percent (the limitation of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i), or 30 percent  (50%-20%). Since F's 30 percent interest would no longer have been  treated as held by a disqualified person on May 26, 1979, F would have  had excess business holdings of 5 percent (30%-25%). Similarly, if F had  not disposed of the 16 percent interest on August 1, 1981 (but had  disposed of the 6 percent interest), on July 1, 1982, at the beginning  of the second phase for F's holdings acquired by will, F's permitted  holdings would have been 25 percent, the lesser of 25 percent (under  section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i)), or 39 percent (44%-5%).
