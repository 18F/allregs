furnished under arrangements is an allowable cost to the extent it is reasonable. Costs are considered reasonable if they--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Do not exceed those that a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would incur to purchase those services; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished by similar physicians or other suppliers in the same or a similar geographic area.
