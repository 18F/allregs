                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For guaranteed loans, the lender must submit a claim for its loss on a form approved by BIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the lender makes an immediate claim under Sec. 103.36(d)(1), it must send BIA the claim for loss within 90 calendar days of the default by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required). The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the date it submits the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the lender elects first to liquidate the collateral securing the loan under Sec. 103.36(d)(2), and has a residual loss after doing so, it must send BIA the claim for loss within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the earlier of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date it submits the claim;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For insured loans, after liquidating all loan collateral, the lender must submit a claim for its loss (if any) on a form approved by BIA. The lender must send BIA the claim for loss by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan through the earlier of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date it submits the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever the lender liquidates loan collateral under Sec. 103.36(d)(2), it must vigorously pursue all reasonable methods of collection concerning the loan collateral before submitting a claim for its residual loss (if any) to BIA. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the lender must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foreclose, either judicially or non-judicially, all rights of redemption the borrower or any co-maker or guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) may have in collateral under any mortgage securing the loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gather and dispose of all personal property pledged as collateral under the loan, in accordance with applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exercise all set-off rights the lender may have under contract or applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make demand for payment on the borrower, all co-makers, and all guarantors of the loan (other than BIA); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Participate fully in all bankruptcy proceedings that may arise involving the borrower and any co-maker or guarantor of the loan. Full participation might include, for example, filing a proof of claim in the case, attending creditors' meetings, and seeking a court order releasing the automatic stay of collection efforts so that the lender can liquidate affected loan collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> BIA may require further information, including without limitation copies of any documents the lender is to maintain under Sec. 103.32 and all documentation of liquidation efforts, to help BIA evaluate the lender's claim for loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> BIA will pay the lender the guaranteed or insured portion of the lender's claim for loss, to the extent the claim is based upon reasonably sufficient evidence of the loss and compliance with the requirements of this part. BIA will render a decision on a claim for loss within 90 days of receiving all information it requires to properly evaluate the loss.</p>
