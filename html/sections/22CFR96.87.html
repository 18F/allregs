                            <p class="depth0">If the Secretary suspends or cancels the accreditation or approval  of an agency or person, or debars an agency or person, the agency or  person must cease to provide adoption services in all intercountry  adoption cases. In the case of suspension, it must consult with the  accrediting entity about whether to transfer its intercountry adoption  cases and adoption records. In the case of cancellation or debarment, it  must execute the plans required by Sec. Sec. 96.33(e) and 96.42(d)  under the oversight of the accrediting entity, and transfer its  intercountry adoption cases and adoption records to other accredited  agencies, approved persons, or a State archive, as appropriate. When the  agency or person is unable to transfer such intercountry adoption cases  or adoption records in accordance with the plans or as otherwise agreed  by the accrediting entity, the accrediting entity will so advise the  Secretary who, with the assistance of the accrediting entity, will  coordinate efforts to identify other accredited agencies or approved  persons to assume responsibility for the cases, and to transfer the  records to other accredited agencies or approved persons, or to public  domestic authorities, as appropriate.
