                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general, the contract amount is measured by the consideration  agreed to be paid, whether in money or other valuable consideration, in  return for the obligations assumed under the contract. Thus, even though  a contractor, such as a wrecker entering into a contract with the  Government to raze a building on a site which will remain vacant, may  not be entitled to receive any money from the Government for such work  under his contract or may   even agree to pay the Government in return for the right to dispose of  the salvaged materials, the contract will be deemed one in excess of  $2,500 if the value of the property obtained by the contractor, less  anything he might pay the Government, is in excess of such amount. In  addition, concession contracts are considered to be contracts in excess  of $2,500 if the contractor's gross receipts under the contract may  exceed $2,500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b).)</em> In addition, where an invitation is for  services in an amount in excess of $2,500 and bidders are permitted to  bid on a portion of the services not amounting to more than $2,500, the  amounts of the contracts awarded separately to individual and unrelated  bidders will be measured by the portions of the services covered by  their respective contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a contract is issued in an amount in excess of $2,500 this  amount will govern for purposes of application of the Act even though  penalty deductions, deductions for prompt payment, and similar  deductions may reduce the amount actually expended by the Government to  $2,500 or less.</p>
