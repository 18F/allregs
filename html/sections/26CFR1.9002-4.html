                                Sec. 1.9002-4  Election to pay net increase in tax in installments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act,  and partners A and B had a net increase in tax of $3,000 and $2,000,  respectively, as a result of dealer reserve income adjustments to  partnership income, partner A may elect under section 4(b) of the Act to  pay the net increase in 2 or more, but not exceeding 10, equal annual  installments to the extent that such tax was unpaid on the date of the  election. Partner B may not make the election since his net increase in  tax does not exceed $2,500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Net increase in tax. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``net increase in tax'' means  the amount by which the sum of the increases in tax (including interest)  for all taxable years to which the election under section 4(a) of the  Act applies and which is attributable to the election exceeds the sum of  the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which  the election under such section applies and which is attributable to the  election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining the net increase in tax, the tax and interest for  each taxable year to which the election applies is computed by taking  into account all adjustments necessary to reflect the change to the  proper treatment of dealer reserve income. If the computation results in  additional tax for a taxable year, then interest is computed under  section 6601 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) on   such additional tax for the taxable year involved from the last date  prescribed for payment of the tax for such taxable year to the date the  election is made. The interest so computed is then added to the  additional tax determined for such taxable year. The sum of these two  items (tax plus interest) represents the increase in tax for such  taxable year. If the computation of the tax after taking into account  the appropriate dealer reserve income adjustments results in a reduction  in tax for any taxable year to which the election applies, interest  under section 6611 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior  law) is computed from the date of the overpayment of the tax for such  year to the date of the election. The amount of the interest so computed  is then added to the reduction in tax to determine the total decrease in  tax for such year. The net increase in tax is then determined by adding  together the total increases in tax for each year to which the election  applies and from the resulting total subtracting the sum of the total  decreases in tax for each year. If the total increases in tax for all  such years do not exceed the total decreases in tax, there is no net  increase in tax for purposes of section 4(b) of the Act. For purposes of  determining the net increase in tax, net operating losses affecting the  computation of tax for any prior taxable year not otherwise affected  shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for paying installments. If the election under this section  is made to pay the unpaid portion of the net increase in tax in  installments, the first installment shall be paid on or before the date  prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Code for payment of the tax for the  taxable year in which such election is made. Each succeeding installment  shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date  prescribed for the payment of the preceding installment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of installment privilege--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For nonpayment of  installment. The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act  for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate,  and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from  the district director if any installment under such section is not paid  by the taxpayer on or before the date fixed for its payment, including  any extension of time for payment of any such installment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For other reasons. The extension of time provided by section  4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments  shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice  and demand from the district director if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in any  trade or business,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a partner, his entire interest in the  partnership is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a corporation, it ceases to engage in a trade  or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in  installments is required to be taken into account by an acquiring  corporation under section 5(d) of the Act.   The installment privilege is not terminated under this subparagraph even  though the taxpayer terminates the trade or business in respect of which  the dealer reserve income is attributable provided the taxpayer  continues in a trade or business. Further, the privilege is not  terminated by a transfer of a part of a partnership interest so long as  the partner retains any interest in the partnership. Also, the privilege  is not terminated by a transaction falling within the provisions of  section 381(a) of the Code if, under section 5(d) of the Act, the  acquiring corporation is required to take into account the unpaid  portion of the net increase in tax. In such a case the privilege may be  continued by the acquiring corporation in the same manner and under the  same conditions as though it were the distributor or transferor  corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Redetermination of tax subsequent to exercise of installment  election. Section 4(d) of the Act provides that where a taxpayer has  elected to pay the net increase in tax in installments and thereafter it  becomes necessary to redetermine the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year  to which the election provided by section 4(a) of the Act applies,   then the net increase in tax shall be redetermined. Where the  redetermination does not involve adjustments affecting the treatment of  dealer reserve income, then the net increase in tax previously computed  will not be disturbed. The net increase in tax is limited to the amount  of tax computed under section 4(b)(2) of the Act as a result of the  change in treatment accorded dealer reserve income. If the  redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election  applies results in an addition to the net increase in tax previously  computed, then such addition shall be prorated to all of the  installments whether paid or unpaid. The part of the addition, prorated  to installments which are not yet due, shall be collected at the same  time as, and as a part of, such installments. The part of the addition  prorated to installments, the time for payment of which has arrived,  shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director. Under  section 4(g) of the Act, failure to make such payment within 10 days  after issuance of notice and demand will terminate the installment  privilege. The imposition of interest on the addition to the net  increase in tax as a result of the redetermination will be determined in  the same manner as interest on the previously computed net increase in  tax. Thus, no interest will be imposed on the amount of the addition to  the net increase in tax prorated to installments not yet due unless the  installment privilege is terminated under subsection (f) or (g) of  section 4 of the Act. If a reduction in the net increase in tax results  from a redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election  applies, the entire amount of such reduction shall, in accordance with  the provisions of section 6403 of the Code (relating to overpayment of  installments), be prorated to the installments which are not yet due,  resulting in a pro rata reduction in each of such installments. Where  the redetermination does not involve adjustments pertaining to dealer  reserve income, then any resulting deficiency pertaining to the year to  which the election applies will be assessed and collected, in accordance  with the applicable provisions of the Code (or corresponding provisions  of prior law) without regard to any election made under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Periods of limitation. Section 4(h) of the Act provides that  where there is an extension of time for payment of tax under the  provisions of section 4(b) of the Act, the running of the periods of  limitation provided by section 6502 of the Code (or corresponding  provisions of prior law) for collection of such tax is suspended for the  period of time for which the extension is granted.
