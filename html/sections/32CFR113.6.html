In the absence of a response, DFAS may automatically process the involuntary allotment application on the fifteenth calendar day after the date a response was due.

If the member is not assigned or attached, or not available to respond (e.g., retired, in a prisoner of war status, or in a missing in action status), the commander will promptly complete Section II of DD Form 2654 and attach appropriate documentation supporting the determination. The commander will then mail the application package and DD Form 2654 to DFAS. Section II shall also be used by the commander to notify DFAS of extensions beyond the due date for a response contained in Section I of DD Form 2654. When such extensions are authorized, the commander will complete Section II, make a copy of Sections I and II, and promptly mail the copy to DFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Within 5 days of receipt of an application package and DD Form 2654 from the designated DFAS official, the commander shall notify the member of the receipt of the application, provide the member a copy of the entire application package, and counsel the member using and completing Section III of DD Form 2654 about the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That an application for the establishment of an involuntary allotment

for the lesser of 25 percent of the member's pay subject to involuntary allotment or the maximum percentage of pay subject to garnishment proceedings under the applicable State law has been received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That the member has 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the commander's notice to complete Section IV of DD Form 2654. That for good cause shown, the commander may grant an extension of reasonable time (normally not exceeding 30 calendar days) to submit a response. That during times of deployment, war, national emergency, assignment outside the United States, hospitalization, or other similar situations that prevent the member from obtaining necessary evidence or from responding in a timely manner, extensions exceeding 30 calendar days may be granted. That if the member fails to respond within the time allowed, the commander will note the member's failure to respond in Section V of DD Form 2654 and send the form to DFAS for appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That the member's response will either consent to the involuntary allotment or contest it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> That the member may contest the application for any one of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591) during the judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary allotment application is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Exigencies of military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 112.3(d)) caused the ``absence'' of the member from appearance in a judicial proceeding forming the basis for the judgment upon which the application is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information in the application is patently false or erroneous in material part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The judgment has been fully satisfied, superseded, or set aside.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The judgment has been materially amended, or partially satisfied. When asserting this defense, the member shall include evidence of the amount of the judgment that has been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, the judgment debtor has filed for protection from the creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the applicant is not the judgment holder nor a proper successor in interest to that holder, or the applicant has been enjoined by a Federal or state court from enforcing the judgment debt).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Or other appropriate reasons that must be clearly specified and explained by the member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> That, if the member contests the involuntary allotment, the member shall provide evidence (documentary or otherwise) in support thereof. Furthermore, that any evidence submitted by the member may be disclosed to the applicant for the involuntary allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> That the member may consult with a legal assistance attorney, if reasonably available, or a civilian attorney at no expense to the government. That if a legal assistance attorney is available, the member should immediately arrange for an appointment. That the member may request a reasonable delay from the commander to obtain legal assistance (in cases where an approved delay will cause DFAS to receive the member's response after the due date identified in Section I of DD Form 2654, the commander must immediately notify the designated DFAS official of the delay, the date for an expected response, and the reason for the delay by completing Section II of DD Form 2654 and forwarding a copy of Sections I and II to DFAS). Additionally, that requests for extensions of time based on the need for legal assistance shall be denied to members who fail to exercise due diligence in seeking such assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on the grounds that exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered, then the member's commander shall review and make the final determination on this contention, and notify the designated DFAS official of the commander's decision by completing Section V of DD Form 2654 and forwarding the form to DFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member, the commander at the

level designated by the Service concerned shall consider the definition of ``exigencies of military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 112.3(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additionally, consideration shall be given to whether the commander at the time determined the military duties in question to be of such paramount importance that they prevented making the member available to attend the judicial proceedings, or rendered the member unable to timely respond to process, motions, pleadings, or orders of the court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on any basis other than exigencies of military duty, the application package and DD Form 2654 shall be returned to the commander who shall forward it to the designated DFAS official for appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> That if the member fails to respond to the commander within the time allowed under Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(B), the commander shall notify the designated DFAS official of the member's failure to respond by completing Section V of DD Form 2654, and forwarding the form to DFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After counseling the member in accordance with Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(I), the commander shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Date and sign Section III of DD Form 2654.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtain the member's acknowledgment of counseling by having the member sign the appropriate space on Section III of DD Form 2654.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determine if the member consents to the involuntary allotment or needs the time authorized under this part to review the application package and take appropriate action. If the member consents to the involuntary allotment, the commander shall direct the member to appropriately complete Section IV of DD Form 2654. The commander must then complete the appropriate item in Section V and promptly forward the completed DD Form 2654 to the designated DFAS official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Complete the appropriate items in Section V of DD Form 2654 when the member fails to respond within the time authorized for a response, or asserts that exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the Involuntary Allotment Application is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member, the commander, at the level designated by the Service concerned, shall consider the definition of ``exigencies of military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 112.3(d)), the evidence provided by the member, any other reasonably available evidence (e.g., a copy of the member's personnel record), and whether the commander at the time determined the military duties in question to be of such paramount importance that they prevented making the member available to attend the judicial proceedings, or rendered the member unable to timely respond to process, motions, pleadings, or orders of the court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The evidentiary standard for a commander to determine whether existences of military duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the Involuntary Allotment Application is sought is a ``preponderance of the evidence'' (as defined in Sec. 113.3(d) of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the commander has made a determination on exigencies of military duty, the commander must insert in Section V of DD Form 2654, the title and address of the appeal authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Promptly following the date the member's response is due to the commander as determined by Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(B), ensure that the DD Form 2654 is appropriately completed and mail the form, along with any response received from the member, to DFAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Provide the member a copy of the completed DD Form 2654 within 5 days of mailing to the designated DFAS official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Upon receipt of DD Form 2654 and any additional evidence submitted by the member, the designated DFAS official shall conduct a review of the entire application package, DD Form 2654, and any evidence submitted by the member, to determine whether the application for an involuntary allotment should be approved and established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In those cases where the member's commander has completed Section V of DD Form 2654, and determined that exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in a judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary allotment application is sought, the designated DFAS official shall deny the involuntary allotment application and provide the applicant written notice of the denial and the reason therefor. The designated DFAS official shall also advise the applicant that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The responsibility for determining whether exigencies of military duty existed belonged to the member's commander and the Military Department concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The commander's decision may be appealed within 60 days of the date DFAS mailed the notice of the decision to the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An Appeal must be submitted to the appeal authority at the address provided by DFAS (as found in Section V of the DD Form 2654) in their written notice of denial, and that an appeal submitted to an appeal authority and address different from the one provided by DFAS may be returned without action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An appeal must be submitted in writing and contain sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the commander's exigency determination was correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The appellate authority shall decide an appeal within 30 days of its receipt and promptly notify the applicant in writing of the decision. The 30 day decision period may be extended during times of deployment, war, national emergency, or other similar situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an appeal is successful, the applicant must submit a written request, along with a copy of the appellate authority's decision, to DFAS within 15 days of receipt of the appellate authority's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Upon receiving written notice that an applicant has successfully appealed a commander's determination on exigencies of military duty that resulted in denial of an involuntary allotment application, DFAS shall review the application in accordance with Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v)(C), and determine whether the involuntary allotment should be approved and initiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In all cases, other than as described in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v)(A), the designated DFAS official shall deny an involuntary allotment application, and give written notice to the applicant of the reason(s) for denial, if the designated DFAS official determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591) during the judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary allotment application is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information in the application is patently false or erroneous in material part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The judgment has been fully satisfied, superseded, or set aside.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The judgment has been materially amended, or partially satisfied. In such a case, the request for involuntary allotment may be approved only to satisfy that portion of the judgment that remains in effect and unsatisfied; the remainder of the request shall be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, the judgment debtor has filed for protection from the creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the applicant is not the judgment creditor nor a proper successor in interest to that creditor, or the applicant has been enjoined by a Federal or State court from enforcing the judgment debt).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The member's pay is already subject to one or more involuntary allotments or garnishments that equal the lesser of 25 percent of the member's pay subject to involuntary allotment or the maximum percentage of pay subject to garnishment proceedings under the applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The applicant has abused the processing privilege (e.g., an applicant, having been notified of the requirements of this part, repeatedly refuses or fails to comply therewith).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Or other appropriate reasons that must be clearly explained to the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In all cases other than as described in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v) (A) and (C), the

designated DFAS official shall approve the involuntary allotment application and establish an involuntary allotment against the pay subject to involuntary allotment of the member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The designated DFAS official shall, at any time after establishing an involuntary allotment, cancel or suspend such allotment and notify the applicant of that cancellation if the member concerned, or someone acting on his or her behalf, submits legally sufficient proof, by affidavit or otherwise, that the allotment should not continue because of the existence of the factors enumerated in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v)(A) and (C)(1)-(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments. (i) Payment of an approved involuntary allotment under 32 CFR part 112 and this part shall commence within 30 days after the designated DFAS official has approved the involuntary allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment of an approved involuntary allotment under 32 CFR part 112 and this part shall commence within 30 days after the designated DFAS official has approved the involuntary allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments under this part shall not be required more frequently than once each month, and the designated official shall not be required to vary normal pay and disbursement cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the designated DFAS official receives several applications on the same member of a Military Service, payments shall be satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Payments shall continue until the judgment is satisfied or until canceled or suspended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DFAS shall collect the total judgment, including interest when awarded by the judgment. Within 30 days following collection of the amount of the judgment, including interest as annotated by the applicant in Section I of DD Form 2654, the applicant may submit a final statement of interest that accrued during the pay-off period. This final statement of interest request must be accompanied by a statement of account showing how the applicant computed the interest amount. DFAS will collect this post-application interest provided it is an amount owed pursuant to the judgment. DFAS shall not accept any further interest requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interest or other costs associated with the debt forming the basis for the judgment, but not included as an amount awarded by the judgment, shall not be paid to applicants for involuntary allotments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the member is found not to be entitled to money due from or payable by the Military Services, the designated official shall return the application and advise the applicant that no money is due from or payable by the Military Service to the member. When it appears that pay subject to an involuntary allotment is exhausted temporarily or otherwise unavailable, the applicant shall be told why and for how long that money is unavailable, if known. Involuntary allotments shall be canceled on or before the date a member retires, is discharged, or is released from active duty. The designated DFAS official shall notify the applicant of the reason for cancellation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Upon receiving notice from an applicant that a judgment upon which an involuntary allotment is based has been satisfied, vacated, modified, or set aside, the designated DFAS official shall promptly adjust or discontinue the involuntary allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) may, in DoD 7000.14-R \4\ Volume 7, Part A, designate the priority to be given to involuntary allotments pursuant to 32 CFR part 112 and this part, among the deductions and collections taken from a member's pay, except that they may not give precedence over deductions required to arrive at a member's disposable pay for garnishments or involuntary allotments authorized by statute for alimony and child support payments. In the absence of a contrary designation by the Comptroller, all other lawful deductions (except voluntary allotments by the member) and collections shall take precedence over these involuntary allotments.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 113.3(b).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

No finance charge contracted for, made, or received under any contract shall be in excess of the charge that could be made for such contract under the law of the place in which the contract is signed in the United States by the military member.</p><p class="depth0">a. In the event a contract is signed with a U.S. company in a foreign country, the lowest interest rate of the State or States in which the company is chartered or does business shall apply.</p><p class="depth0">b. However, interest rates and service charges applicable to overseas military banking facilities shall be as established by the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">2. No contract or loan agreement shall provide for an attorney's fee in the event of default unless suit is filed, in which event the fee provided in the contract shall not exceed 20 percent of the obligation found due. No attorney fees shall be authorized if the attorney is a salaried employee of the holder.</p><p class="depth0">3. In loan transactions, defenses that the debtor may have against the original lender or its agent shall be good against any subsequent holder of the obligation. In credit transactions, defenses against the seller or its agent shall be good against any subsequent holder of the obligation, provided that the holder had actual knowledge of the defense or under conditions where reasonable inquiry would have apprised the holder of this fact.</p><p class="depth0">4. The military member shall have the right to remove any security for the obligation beyond State or national boundaries if the military member or family moves beyond such boundaries under military orders and notifies the creditor, in advance of the removal, of the new address where the security will be located. Removal of the security shall not accelerate payment of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">5. No late charge shall be made in excess of 5 percent of the late payment, or $5.00, whichever is the lesser amount, or as provided by law or applicable regulatory agency determination. Only one late charge may be made for any tardy installment. Late charges shall not be levied where an allotment has been timely filed, but payment of the allotment has been delayed. Late charges by overseas banking facilities are a matter of contract with the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">6. The obligation may be paid in full at any time or through accelerated payments of any amount. There shall be no penalty for prepayment. In the event of prepayment, that portion of the finance charges that has inured to the benefit of the seller or creditor shall be prorated on the basis of the charges that would have been ratably payable had finance charges been calculated and payable as equal periodic payments over the terms of the contract, and only the prorated amount to the date of prepayment shall be due. As an alternative, the ``Rule of 78'' may be applied.</p><p class="depth0">7. If a charge is made for loan insurance protection, it must be evidenced by delivery of a policy or certificate of insurance to the military member within 30 days.</p><p class="depth0">8. If the loan or contract agreement provides for payments in installation, each payment, other than the down payment, shall be in equal or substantially equal amounts, and installments shall be successive and of equal or substantially equal duration.</p><p class="depth0">9. If the security for the debt is repossessed and sold in order to satisfy or reduce the debt, the repossession and resale shall be governed by the laws of the State in which the security is requested.</p><p class="depth0">10. A contract for personal goods and services may be terminated at any time before delivery of the goods or services without charge to the purchaser. However, if goods made to the special order of the purchaser result in preproduction costs, or require preparation for delivery, such additional costs shall be listed in the order form or contract.</p><p class="depth0">a. No termination charge shall be made in excess of this amount. Contracts for delivery at future intervals may be terminated as to the undelivered portion.</p><p class="depth0">b. The purchaser shall be chargeable only for that proportion of the total cost that the

goods or services delivered bear to the total goods called for by the contract. (This is in addition to the right to rescind certain credit transactions involving a security interest in real estate provided by the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 1631-1646, 1661-1665a, 1666-1666j, and 1667-1667e) and Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 226)).</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C to Part 113--Sample DD Form 2653, ``Involuntary Allotment</p><p class="depth0">Application''[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA95.002
