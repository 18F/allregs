                            <p class="depth0">The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all PCS entities on April 4,  2005, which is ten years after the date that voluntary negotiations  commenced for A and B block PCS entities. Those PCS entities that are  paying their portion of relocation costs on an installment basis must  continue the payments until the obligation is satisfied.  [61 FR 29693, June 12, 1996]    Sec. Appendix I to Subpart E of Part 24--A Procedure for Calculating PCS</p><p class="depth0">Signal Levels at Microwave Receivers (Appendix E of the Memorandum</p><p class="depth0">Opinion and Order)</p><p class="depth0">The new Rules adopted in Part 24 stipulate that estimates of  interference to fixed microwave operations from a PCS operation will be  based on the sum of signals received at a microwave receiver from the  PCS operation. This appendix describes a procedure for computing this  PCS level.</p><p class="depth0">In general, the procedure involves four steps:</p><p class="depth0">1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers  operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the coordination  distance of each base station and the characteristics of each receiver,  i.e., adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, pattern and height,  and line and other losses.</p><p class="depth0">2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.)  for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and  portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of  pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and  density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent  hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors,  and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above,  calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave  receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.</p><p class="depth0">4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3,  determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria  described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.</p><p class="depth0">The interference from each base station and the mobiles and  portables associated with it is calculated as follows:  Prbi = 10Log (ptbi)-Lbi-UCi</p><p class="depth0">+ Gmwi-Ci-BPi Prmi = 10Log (nmi x ptmi)-</p><p class="depth0">Lmi-UCi + Gmwi-Ci Prpsi = 10Log (npsi x ptpsi)-</p><p class="depth0">Lpsi-UCi + Gmwi-Ci Prpbi = 10Log (npbi x ptpbi)-</p><p class="depth0">Lpbi-UCi-(BPi-BHi)</p><p class="depth0">+ Gmwi-Ci Prpri = 10Log (npri x ptpri)-</p><p class="depth0">Lpri-(UCi-BHi) +</p><p class="depth0">Gmwi-Ci  where:  P refers to Power in dBm p refers to power in milliwatts Prbi = Power at MW receiver from ith base station in dBm ptbi = e.i.r.p. transmitted from ith base station in</p><p class="depth0">milliwatts, which equals average power per channel x number of</p><p class="depth0">channels x antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna -</p><p class="depth0">line loss Lbi = Path loss between MW and base station site in dB UCi = Urban correction factor in dB Gmwi = Gain of MW antenna in pertinent direction (dBi) Ci = Channel discrimination of MW system in dB Prmi = Power at MW receiver from mobiles associated with ith</p><p class="depth0">base station ptmi = e.i.r.p. transmitted from mobiles associated with ith</p><p class="depth0">base station   nmi = Number of mobiles associated with ith base station Lmi = Path loss between MW and mobile transmitters in dB Prpsi = Power at MW receiver from outdoor portables (s for</p><p class="depth0">sidewalk) ptpsi = e.i.r.p. transmitted from outdoor portables</p><p class="depth0">associated with ith base station npsi = Number of outdoor portables associated with ith base</p><p class="depth0">station Lpsi = Path loss between MW and outdoor portables in dB Prpbi = Power at MW receiver from indoor portables (b for</p><p class="depth0">building) ptpbi = e.i.r.p. transmitted from indoor portables associated</p><p class="depth0">with ith base station npbi = number of indoor portables associated with ith base</p><p class="depth0">station Lpbi = Path loss in dB between MW and base station site</p><p class="depth0">(using average building height divided by 2 as effective</p><p class="depth0">antenna height) Prpri = Power at MW receiver from rooftop portables (r for</p><p class="depth0">rooftop) ptpri = e.i.r.p. transmitted from rooftop portables</p><p class="depth0">associated with ith base station npri = Number of rooftop portables associated with ith base</p><p class="depth0">station Lpri = Path loss in dB between MW and base station site</p><p class="depth0">(using average building height as effective antenna height) BPi = Building penetration loss at street level in dB BHi = Height gain for portables in buildings dB = 2.5 x (nf-</p><p class="depth0">1), where nf is number of floors</p><p class="depth0">Note: Where Ci varies from channel-to-channel, which  often is the case, the summation process is more complex, requiring  summation at a channel level first.</p><p class="depth0">Finally, the total PCS interference power at a given microwave  receiver from all the base stations in a given frequency band is found  by summing the contributions from the individual stations. Likewise, the  total interference power at a given microwave receiver from all mobiles  and portables operating in a given frequency band is found by summing  the contributions from the mobiles and portables associated with each  cell. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JN94.017</p><p class="depth0">Base Stations. Interference from each base station to each microwave  should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations  having more or less (within 50 percent) the same  height above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path  to a microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving  site of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total  power of the group and the average antenna height of the group to  calculate path loss, L.</p><p class="depth0">Mobile Stations. The e.i.r.p. from mobile transmitters is weighted  according to the number of base station channels expected to be devoted  to mobile operation at any given time. The antenna height of mobiles  used in calculating path loss, L, is assumed to be 2 meters.</p><p class="depth0">Portable Stations. The e.i.r.p. from the portable units associated  with each base station is weighted according to the estimated portion of  portables associated with that cell expected to be operated inside  buildings at any given time and the portion which could be expected to  be operating from elevated locations, such as balconies or building  rooftops. For example, in the case of service intended for business use  in an urban area, one might expect that perhaps 85 percent of the  portables in use at any given time would be operating from within  buildings and perhaps 5 percent might be operating from rooftops or  balconies. The remaining 10 percent would be outside at street level.</p><p class="depth0">Calculation of an equivalent e.i.r.p. for cells in suburban areas  will involve different weighting criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Urban Correction Factor. The urban correction factor (UC) depends on  the height and density of buildings surrounding a base station. For the  core area of large cities, it is assumed to be 35 dB. For medium size  cities and fringe areas of large cities (4- to 6-story buildings with  scattered taller buildings and lower buildings and open spaces) it is  assumed to be 25 dB; for small cities and towns, 15 dB, and for suburban  residential areas (one- and two-story, single family   houses with scattered multiple-story apartment buildings, shopping  centers and open areas), 10 dB.</p><p class="depth0">The unadjusted urban correction factor, UC, should not be applied to  base station antenna heights that are greater than 50 percent of the  average building height for a cell.</p><p class="depth0">Building Height and Building Penetration Factors. The building  height correction, BH, is a function of the average building height  within the nominal coverage area of the base station. It is used in  conjunction with the building penetration loss, BP, to adjust the  expected interference contribution from that portion of the portables  transmitting from within buildings. The adjustment is given by:  BP = 20 dB in urban areas BP = 10 dB in suburban areas BH = 2.5 x (nf-1) dB  where nf is the average height (number of floors) of the buildings in  the area.</p><p class="depth0">(Note that this formula implies a net gain when the average building  height is greater than 8 floors). All buildings more than twice the  average height should be considered individually. The contribution to BH  from that portion of portables in the building above the average  building height should be increased by a factor of 20Log(h) dB, where h  is the height of the portables above the average building height in  meters.</p><p class="depth0">Channel Discrimination Factor. A factor based on the interference  selectivity of the microwave receiver.</p><p class="depth0">Propagation Model. The PCS to microwave path loss, L, is calculated  using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2., in the point- to-point mode. The Longley-Rice [1] model was derived from NBS Technical  Note 101 [2], and updated in 1982 by Hufford [3]. Version 1.2.2  incorporated modifications described in a letter by Hufford [4] in 1985.  Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the U.S.  Geological Survey 3-second digitized terrain database.</p><p class="depth0">Special Situations. If a cell size is large compared to the distance  between the cell and a microwave receiving site so that it subtends an  angle greater than 5 degrees, the cell should be subdivided and  calculations should be based on the expected distribution of mobiles and  portables within each subdivision.</p><p class="depth0">If terrain elevations within a cell differ by more than a factor of  two-to-one, the cell should be subdivided and microwave interference  calculations should be based on the average terrain elevation for each  subdivision.</p><p class="depth0">If a co-channel PCS base station lies within the main beam of a  microwave antenna (5 degrees), there is no  intervening terrain obstructions, and the power at the microwave  receiver from that base station, assuming free space propagation, would  be 3 dB or less below the interference threshold, interference will be  assumed to exist unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by  specific path loss calculations based on terrain and building losses.</p><p class="depth0">If any part of a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam  of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain  obstructions, and the accumulative power of 5 percent or less of the  mobiles, assuming free space propagation would be 3 dB or less below the  interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the  PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss  calculations based on terrain and building losses.</p><p class="depth0">If a building within a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main  beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain  obstructions, and the cumulative power of 5 percent or fewer of the  portables, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below  the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless  the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss  calculations based on terrain and building losses.</p><p class="depth0">References:</p><p class="depth0">1.
