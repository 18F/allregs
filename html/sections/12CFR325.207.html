[77 FR 62424, Oct. 15, 2012, as amended at 79 FR 69369, Nov. 21, 2014]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 325--Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital</p><p class="depth0">Capital adequacy is one of the critical factors that the FDIC is required to analyze when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. In view of this, the FDIC's Board of Directors has adopted part 325 of its regulations, which sets forth (1) minimum standards of capital adequacy for insured state nonmember banks and (2) standards for determining when an insured bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition by reason of the amount of its capital.</p><p class="depth0">This capital maintenance regulation was designed to establish, in conjunction with other Federal bank regulatory agencies, uniform capital standards for all federally-regulated banking organizations, regardless of size. The uniform capital standards were based on ratios of capital to total assets. While those leverage ratios have served as a useful tool for assessing capital adequacy, the FDIC believes there is a need for a capital measure that is more explicitly and systematically sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banks. As a result, the FDIC's Board of Directors has adopted this Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital to supplement the part 325 regulation. This statement of policy does not replace or eliminate the existing part 325 capital-to-total assets leverage ratios.</p><p class="depth0">The framework set forth in this statement of policy consists of (1) a definition of capital for risk-based capital purposes, and (2) a system for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories. A bank's risk-based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying total capital base (the numerator of the ratio) by its risk-weighted assets (the denominator). \1\ Table I outlines the definition of capital and provides a general explanation of how the risk-based capital ratio is calculated, Table II summarizes the risk weights and risk categories, and Table III sets forth the credit conversation factors for off-balance sheet items. Additional explanations of the capital definitions, the risk-weighted asset calculations, and the minimum risk-based capital ratio guidelines are provided in Sections I, II and III of this statement of policy.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Period-end amounts, rather than average balances, normally will be used when calculating risk-based capital ratios. However, on a case-by-case basis, ratios based on average balances may also be required if supervisory concerns render it appropriate.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In addition, when certain banks that engage in trading activities calculate their risk-based capital ratio under this appendix A, they must also refer to appendix C of this part, which incorporates capital charges for certain market risks into the risk-based capital ratio. When calculating their risk-based capital ratio under this appendix A, such banks are required to refer to appendix C of this part for supplemental rules to determine qualifying and excess capital, calculate risk-weighted assets, calculate market risk equivalent assets and add them to risk-weighted assets, and calculate risk-based capital ratios as adjusted for market risk.</p><p class="depth0">This statement of policy applies to all FDIC-insured state-chartered banks (excluding insured branches of foreign banks) that are not members of the Federal Reserve System, hereafter referred to as state nonmember banks, regardless of size, and to all circumstances in which the FDIC is required to evaluate the capital of a banking organization. Therefore, the risk-based capital framework set forth in this statement of policy will be used in the examination and supervisory process as well as in the analysis of applications that the FDIC is required to act upon.</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk, however, the ratio does not take account of many other factors that can affect a bank's financial condition. These factors include overall interest rate risk exposure, liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment, loan portfolio,

and other concentrations of credit risk, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks, including the risk presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities. In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of each of these other factors, including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and adversely classified assets as well as a bank's interest rate risk as measured by the bank's exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates. For this reason, the final supervisory judgment on a bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from the conclusions that might be drawn solely from the absolute level of the bank's risk-based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0">In light of these other considerations, banks generally are expected to operate above the minimum risk-based capital ratio. Banks contemplating significant expansion plans, as well as those institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk, should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.</p><p class="depth0">I. Definition of Capital for the Risk-Based Capital Ratio</p><p class="depth0">A bank's qualifying total capital base consists of two types of capital elements: core capital elements (Tier 1) and supplementary capital elements (Tier 2). To qualify as an element of Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital, a capital instrument should not contain or be subject to any conditions, covenants, terms, restrictions, or provisions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Components of Qualifying Capital (see Table I)</p><p class="depth0">1. Core capital elements (Tier 1) consists of:</p><p class="depth0">i. Common stockholders' equity capital (includes common stock and related surplus, undivided profits, disclosed capital reserves that represent a segregation of undivided profits, and foreign currency translation adjustments, less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values);</p><p class="depth0">ii. Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, \2\ including any related surplus; and---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Preferred stock issues where the dividend is reset periodically based, in whole or in part, upon the bank's current credit standing, including but not limited to, auction rate, money market or remarketable preferred stock, are assigned to Tier 2 capital, regardless of whether the dividends are cumultive or noncumulative.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">iii. Minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> At least 50 percent of the qualifying total capital base should consist of Tier 1 capital. Core (Tier 1) capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements minus all intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships eligible for inclusion in core capital pursuant to Sec. 325.5(f)), \3\ minus credit-enhancing interest-only strips that are not eligible for inclusion in core capital pursuant to Sec. 325.5(f), minus any disallowed deferred tax assets, and minus any amount of nonfinancial equity investments required to be deducted pursuant to section II.B.(6) of this Appendix.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ An exception is allowed for intanglble assets that are explicitly approved by the FDIC as part of the bank's regulatory capital on a specific case basis. These intangibles will be included in capital for risk-based capital purposes under the terms and conditions that are specifically approved by the FDIC.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Although nonvoting common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries are normally included in Tier 1 capital, voting common stockholders' equity generally will be expected to be the dominant form of Tier 1 capital. Thus, banks should avoid undue reliance on nonvoting equity, preferred stock and minority interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Although minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries are generally included in regulatory capital, exceptions to this general rule will be made if the minority interests fail to provide meaningful capital support to the consolidated bank. Such a situation could arise if the minority interests are entitled to a preferred claim on essentially low risk assets of the subsidiary. Similarly, although credit-enhancing interest-only strips and intangible assets in the form of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships are generally recognized for risk-based capital purposes, the deduction of part or all of the credit-enhancing interest-only strips, mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships may be required if the carrying amounts of these assets are excessive in relation to their market value or the level of the bank's capital accounts. Credit-enhancing interest-only strips, mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships and deferred tax assets that do not meet the conditions, limitations and restrictions described in Sec. 325.5(f) and (g) of this part will not be recognized for risk-based capital purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minority interests in small business investment companies, investment funds that

hold nonfinancial equity investments (as defined in section II.B.(6)(ii) of this appendix A), and subsidiaries that are engaged in non-financial activities are not included in the bank's Tier 1 or total capital base if the bank's interest in the company or fund is held under one of the legal authorities listed in section II.B.(6)(ii) of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">2. Supplementary capital elements (Tier 2) consist of:</p><p class="depth0">i. Allowance for loan and lease losses, up to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, long-term preferred stock (original maturity of at least 20 years), and any related surplus;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Perpetual preferred stock (and any related surplus) where the dividend is reset periodically based, in whole or part, on the bank's current credit standing, regardless of whether the dividends are cumulative or noncumulative;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Hybrid capital instruments, including mandatory convertible debt securities;</p><p class="depth0">v. Term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock (original average maturity of five years or more) and any related surplus; and</p><p class="depth0">vi. Net unrealized holding gains on equity securities (subject to the limitations discussed in paragraph I.A.2.(f) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">The maximum amount of Tier 2 capital that may be recognized for risk-based capital purposes is limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital (after any deductions for disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets). In addition, the combined amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock that may be treated as part of Tier 2 capital for risk-based capital purposes is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. Amounts in excess of these limits may be issued but are not included in the calculation of the risk-based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allowance for loan and lease losses. Allowances for loan and lease losses are reserves that have been established through a charge against earnings to absorb future losses on loans or lease financing receivables. Allowances for loan and lease losses exclude allocated transfer risk reserves, \4\ and reserves created against identified losses.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Allocated transfer risk reserves are reserves that have been established in accordance with section 905(a) of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 against certain assets whose value has been found by the U.S. supervisory authorities to have been significantly impaired by protracted transfer risk problems.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">This risk-based capital framework provides a phasedown during the transition period of the extent to which the allowance for loan and lease losses may be included in an institution's capital base. By year-end 1990, the allowance for loan and lease losses, as an element of supplementary capital, may constitute no more than 1.5 percent of risk-weighted assets and, by year-end 1992, no more than 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets. \5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ The amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that may be included as a supplementary capital element is based on a percentage of gross risk-weighted assets. A bank may deduct reserves for loan and lease losses that are in excess of the amount permitted to be included in capital, as well as allocated transfer risk reserves, from gross risk-weighted assets when computing the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preferred stock. Perpetual preferred stock is defined as preferred stock that does not have a maturity date, that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder, and that has no other provisions that will require future redemption of the issue. Long-term preferred stock includes limited-life preferred stock with an original maturity of 20 years or more, provided that the stock cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder prior to maturity, except with the prior approval of the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative perpetual preferred stock and long-term preferred stock qualify for inclusion in supplementary capital provided that the instruments can absorb losses while the issuer operates as a going concern (a fundamental characteristic of equity capital) and provided the issuer has the option to defer payment of dividends on these instruments. Given these conditions, and the perpetual or long-term nature of the intruments, there is no limit on the amount of these preferred stock instruments that may be included with Tier 2 capital.</p><p class="depth0">Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock where the dividend is reset periodically based, in whole or in part, on the bank's current credit standing, including auction rate, money market, or remarketable preferred stock, are also assigned to Tier 2 capital without limit, provided the above conditions are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hybrid capital instruments. Hybrid capital instruments include instruments that have certain characteristics of both debt and equity. In order to be included as supplementary capital elements, these instruments should meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The instrument should be unsecured, subordinated to the claims of depositors and general creditors, and fully paid-up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The instrument should not be redeemable at the option of the holder prior to maturity, except with the prior approval of the FDIC. This requirement implies that holders of such instruments may not accelerate the payment of principal except in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The instrument should be available to participate in losses while the issuer is operating as a going concern. (Term subordinated debt would not meet this requirement.) To satisfy this requirement, the instrument should convert to common or perpetual preferred stock in the event that the sum of the undivided profits and capital surplus accounts of the issuer results in a negative balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The instrument should provide the option for the issuer to defer principal and interest payments if: (a) The issuer does not report a profit in the preceding annual period, defined as combined profits (i.e., net income) for the most recent four quarters, and (b) the issuer eliminates cash dividends on its common and preferred stock.</p><p class="depth0">Mandatory convertible debt securities, which are subordinated debt instruments that require the issuer to convert such instruments into common or perpetual preferred stock by a date at or before the maturity of the debt instruments, will qualify as hybrid capital instruments provided the maturity of these instruments is 12 years or less and the instruments meet the criteria set forth below for ``term subordinated debt.'' There is no limit on the amount of hybrid capital instruments that may be included within Tier 2 capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock. The aggregate amount of term subordinated debt (excluding mandatory convertible debt securities) and intermediate-term preferred stock (including any related surplus) that may be treated as Tier 2 capital for risk-based capital purposes is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. Term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock should have an original average maturity of at least five years to qualify as supplementary capital and should not be redeemable at the option of the holder prior to maturity, except with the prior approval of the FDIC. For state nonmember banks, a term subordinated debt instrument is an obligation other than a deposit obligation that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bears on its face, in boldface type, the following: This obligation is not a deposit and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Has a maturity of at least five years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has a maturity of at least five years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an obligation or issue that provides for scheduled repayments of principal, has an average maturity of at least five years; provided that the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may permit the issuance of an obligation or issue with a shorter maturity or average maturity if the Director has determined that exigent circumstances require the issuance of such obligation or issue; provided further that the provisions of this paragraph I.A.2.(d)(2) shall not apply to mandatory convertible debt obligations or issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> States express that the obligation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is subordinated and junior in right of payment to the issuing bank's obligations to its depositors and to the bank's other obligations to its general and secured creditors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is ineligible as collateral for a loan by the issuing bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is unsecured;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> States expressly that the issuing bank may not retire any part of its obligation without the prior written consent of the FDIC or other primary federal regulator; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Includes, if the obligation is issued to a depository institution, a specific waiver of the right of offset by the lending depository institution.
Subordinated debt obligations issued prior to December 2, 1987 that satisfied the definition of the term ``subordinated note and debenture'' that was in effect prior to that date also will be deemed to be term subordinated debt for risk-based capital purposes. An optional redemption (``call'') provision in a subordinated debt instrument that is exercisable by the issuing bank in less than five years will not be deemed to constitute a maturity of less than five years, provided that the obligation otherwise has a stated contractual maturity of at least five years; the call is exercisable solely at the discretion or option of the issuing bank, and not at the discretion or option of the holder of the obligation; and the call is exercisable only with the express prior written consent of the FDIC under 12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1) at the time early redemption or retirement is sought, and such consent has not been given in advance at the time of issuance of the obligation. Optional redemption provisions will be accorded similar treatment when determining the perpetual nature and/or maturity of preferred stock and other capital instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Discount of limited-life supplementary capital instruments. As a limited-life capital instrument approaches maturity, the instrument begins to take on charcteristics of a short-term obligation and becomes less like a component of capital. Therefore, for risk-based capital purposes, the outstanding amount of term subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock eligible for inclusion in capital will be adjusted downward, or discounted, as the instruments approach maturity. Each limited-life capital instrument will be discounted by reducing the outstanding amount of the capital instrument eligible for inclusion as supplementary capital by a fifth of the original amount (less redemptions) each year during the instrument's last five years before maturity. Such instruments, therefore, will have no capital value when they have a remaining maturity of less than a year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Unrealized gains on equity securities and unrealized gains (losses) on other assets. Up to 45 percent of pretax net unrealized holding gains (that is, the excess, if any, of the fair value over historical cost) on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values may be included in supplementary capital. However, the FDIC may exclude all or a portion of these unrealized gains from Tier 2 capital if the FDIC determines that the equity securities are not prudently valued. Unrealized gains (losses) on other types of assets, such as bank premises and available-for-sale debt securities, are not included in supplementary capital, but the FDIC may take these unrealized gains (losses) into account as additional factors when assessing a bank's overall capital adequacy.</p><p class="depth0">B. Deductions from Capital and Other Adjustments</p><p class="depth0">Certain assets are deducted from a bank's capital base for the purpose of calculating the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio. \6\ These assets include:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Any assets deducted from capital when computing the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio will also be excluded from risk-weighted assets when computing the denominator of the ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships. \7\ These disallowed intangibles are deducted from the core capital (Tier 1) elements.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ In addition to mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships, certain other intangibles may be allowed if explicitly approved by the FDIC as part of the bank's regulatory capital on a specific case basis. In evaluating whether other types of intangibles should be recognized for regulatory capital purposes on a specific case basis, the FDIC will accord special attention to the general characteristics of the intangibles, including: (1) The separability of the intangible asset and the ability to sell it separate and apart from the bank or the bulk of the bank's assets, (2) the certainty that a readily identifiable stream of cash flows associated with the intangible asset can hold its value notwithstanding the future prospects of the bank, and (3) the existence of a market of sufficient depth to provide liquidity for the intangible asset.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries. \8\ This includes any equity or debt capital investments in banking or finance subsidaries if the subsidiaries are not consolidated for regulatory capital requirements. \9\ Generally, these investments include equity and debt capital securities and any other instruments or commitments that are deemed to be capital of the subsidiary. These investments are deducted from the bank's total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital base.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ For risk-based capital purposes, these subsidiaries are generally defined as any company that is primarily engaged in banking or finance and in which the bank, either directly or indirectly, owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock but does not consolidate the company for regulatory capital purposes. In addition to investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries, the FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, deduct investments in associated companies or joint ventures, which are generally defined as any companies in which the bank, either directly or indirectly, owns 20 to 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock. Alternatively, the FDIC may, in certain cases, apply an appropriate risk-weighted capital charge against a bank's proportionate interest in the assets of associated companies and joint ventures. The definitions for subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are contained in the instructions for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income.</p><p class="depth0">\9\ Consolidation requirements for regulatory capital purposes generally follow the consolidation requirements set forth in the instructions for preparation of the consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. However, although investments in subsidiaries representing majority ownership in another Federally-insured depository institution are not consolidated for purposes of the consolidated Reports of Condition and Income that are filed by the parent bank, they are generally consolidated for purposes of determining FDIC regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, investments in these depository institution subsidiaries generally will not be deducted for risk-based capital purposes; rather, assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries will be consolidated with those of the parent bank when calculating the risk-based capital ratio. In addition, although securities subsidiaries established pursuant to 12 CFR 337.4 are consolidated for Report of Condition and Income purposes, they are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Investments in securities subsidiaries established pursuant to 12 CFR 337.4. The FDIC may also consider deducting investments in other subsidiaries, either on a case-by-case basis or, as with securities subsidiaries, based on the general characteristics or functional nature of the subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reciprocal holdings of capital instruments of banks that represent intentional cross-holdings by the banks. These holdings

are deducted from the bank's total capital base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deferred tax assets in excess of the limit set forth in Sec. 325.5(g). These disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted from the core capital (Tier 1) elements.</p><p class="depth0">On a case-by-case basis, and in conjunction with supervisory examinations, other deductions from capital may also be required, including any adjustments deemed appropriate for assets classified as loss.</p><p class="depth0">II. Procedures For Computing Risk-Weighted Assets</p><p class="depth0">A. General Procedures</p><p class="depth0">1. Under the risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevent, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the four risk categories are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted. \10\ comprises the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ Any asset deducted from a bank's capital accounts when computing the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio will also be excluded from risk-weighted assets when calculating the denominator for the ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. The risk-weighted amounts for all off-balance sheet items are determined by a two-step process. First, the notional principal, or face value, amount of each off-balance sheet item generally is multiplied by a credit conversion factor to arrive at a balance sheet credit equivalent amount. Second, the credit equivalent amount generally is assigned to the appropriate risk category, like any balance sheet asset, according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may, on a case-by-case basis, determine the appropriate risk weight for any asset or credit equivalent amount that does not fit wholly within one of the risk categories set forth in this Appendix A or that imposes risks on a bank that are not commensurate with the risk weight otherwise specified in this Appendix A for the asset or credit equivalent amount. In addition, the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may, on a case-by-case basis, determine the appropriate credit conversion factor for any off-balance sheet item that does not fit wholly within one of the credit conversion factors set forth in this Appendix A or that imposes risks on a bank that are not commensurate with the credit conversion factor otherwise specified in this Appendix A for the off-balance sheet item. In making such a determination, the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) will consider the similarity of the asset or off-balance sheet item to assets or off-balance sheet items explicitly treated in sections II.B and II.C of this appendix A, as well as other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may, on a case-by-case basis, determine that the regulatory capital treatment for an exposure or other relationship to an entity that is not subject to consolidation on the balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the bank to the entity. In making this determination, the Director of DSC may require the bank to treat the entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the bank for risk-based capital purposes and calculate the appropriate risk-based capital ratios accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">5. Optional Transition Provisions Related to the Implementation of Consolidation Requirements Under FAS 167</p><p class="depth0">Section II.A.5 of this appendix provides optional transition provisions for a State nonmember bank that is required for financial and regulatory reporting purposes, as a result of its implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FAS 167), to consolidate certain variable interest entities (VIEs) as defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These transition provisions apply through the end of the fourth quarter following the date of a bank's implementation of FAS 167 (implementation date).</p><p class="depth0">i. Exclusion period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exclusion of risk-weighted assets for the first and second quarters.

During the exclusion period, including the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within the exclusion period, a bank adopting the optional provisions of this paragraph i. of this section II.A.5 must calculate risk-weighted assets for its contractual exposures to the VIEs referenced in paragraph i.(a) of this section II.A.5 on the implementation date and include this calculated amount in its risk-weighted assets.

Implicit recourse limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section II.A.5, assets held by a VIE to which the bank has provided recourse through credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold may not be excluded from risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0">B. Other Considerations</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect Holdings of Assets. Some of the assets on a bank's balance sheet may represent an indirect holding of a pool of assets; for example, mutual funds. An investment in shares of a mutual fund whose portfolio consists solely of various securities or money market instruments that, if held separately, would be assigned to different risk categories, generally is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the highest risk-weighted asset that the fund is permitted to hold in accordance with the stated investment objectives set forth in its prospectus. The bank may, at its option, assign the investment on a pro rata basis to different risk categories according to the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, but in no case will indirect holdings through shares in any mutual fund be assigned to a risk weight less than 20 percent. If the bank chooses to assign its investment on a pro rata basis, and the sum of the investment limits in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100 percent, the bank must assign risk weights in descending order. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of short-term liquidity, a fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly liquid securities of superior credit quality that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight, such securities will generally be disregarded in determining the risk category to which the bank's holdings in the overall fund should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of the mutual fund investment. For example, the use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the interest rate risk of its government bond portfolio will not increase the risk weight of that fund above the 20 percent category. Nonetheless, if the fund engages in any activities that appear speculative in nature or has any other characteristics that

are inconsistent with the preferential risk weighting assigned to the fund's assets, holdings in the fund will be assigned to the 100 percent risk category.</p><p class="depth0">2. Collateral. In determining risk weights of various assets, the only forms of collateral that are formally recognized by the risk-based capital framework are cash on deposit in the lending bank; securities issued or guaranteed by the central governments of the OECD-based group of countries, \11\ U.S. Government agencies, or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies; and securities issued or guaranteed by multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks. Claims fully secured by such collateral are assigned to the 20 percent risk category. The extent to which these securities are recognized as collateral for risk-based capital purposes is determined by their current market value. If a claim is partially secured, the portion of the claim that is not covered by the collateral is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ The OECD-based group of countries comprises all full members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regardless of entry date, as well as countries that have concluded special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow, but excludes any country that has rescheduled its external sovereign debt within the previous five years. As of November 1995, the OECD included the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and Saudi Arabia had concluded special lending arrangements with the IMF associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow. A rescheduling of external sovereign debt generally would include any renegotiation of terms arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to meet its external debt service obligations, but generally would not include renegotiations of debt in the normal course of business, such as a renegotiation to allow the borrower to take advantage of a decline in interest rates or other change in market conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Guarantees. Guarantees of the OECD and non-OECD central governments, U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, state and local governments of the OECD-based group of countries, multilateral lending institutions and regional development banks, U.S. depository institutions, foreign banks, and qualifying OECD-based securities firms are also recognized. If a claim is partially guaranteed, the portion of the claim that is not fully covered by the guarantee is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">4. Maturity. Maturity is generally not a factor in assigning items to risk categories with the exceptions of claims on non-OECD banks, commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange rate related contracts. Except for commitments, short-term is defined as one year or less remaining maturity and long-term is defined as over one year remaining maturity. In the case of commitments, short-term is defined as one year or less original maturity and long-term is defined as over one year original maturity.\12\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ Through year-end 1992, remaining rather than original maturity may be used for determining term to maturity for commitments.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">5. Recourse, Direct Credit Substitutes, Residual Interests and Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities. For purposes of this section II.B.5 of this appendix A, the following definitions will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit derivative means a contract that allows one party (the ``protection purchaser'') to transfer the credit risk of an asset or off-balance sheet credit exposure to another party (the ``protection provider''). The value of a credit derivative is dependent, at least in part, on the credit performance of the ``reference asset.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit-enhancing interest only strip is defined in Sec. 325.2(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit-enhancing representations and warranties means representations and warranties that are made or assumed in connection with a transfer of assets (including loan servicing assets) and that obligate the bank to protect investors from losses arising from credit risk in the assets transferred or the loans serviced. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties include promises to protect a party from losses resulting from the default or nonperformance of another party or from an insufficiency in the value of the collateral. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties do not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Early default clauses and similar warranties that permit the return of, or premium refund clauses covering, 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans that qualify for a 50 percent risk weight for a period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer. These warranties may cover only those loans that were originated within 1 year of the date of transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Premium refund clauses that cover assets guaranteed, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government, a U.S. Government agency or a government-sponsored enterprise, provided the premium refund clauses are for a

period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Warranties that permit the return of assets in instances of misrepresentation, fraud or incomplete documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Direct credit substitute means an arrangement in which a bank assumes, in form or in substance, credit risk associated with an on-or off-balance sheet credit exposure that was not previously owned by the bank (third-party asset) and the risk assumed by the bank exceeds the pro rata share of the bank's interest in the third-party asset. If the bank has no claim on the third-party asset, then the bank's assumption of any credit risk with respect to the third party asset is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Financial standby letters of credit, which includes any letter of credit or similar arrangement, however named or described, that support financial claims on a third party that exceed a bank's pro rata share of losses in the financial claim;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guarantees, surety arrangements, credit derivatives, and similar instruments backing financial claims;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of credit losses from the underlying assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Credit derivative contracts under which the bank assumes more than its pro rata share of credit risk on a third party asset or exposure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Loans or lines of credit that provide credit enhancement for the financial obligations of an account party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Purchased loan servicing assets if the servicer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is responsible for credit losses with the loans being serviced,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is responsible for making servicer cash advances (unless the advances are not direct credit substitutes because they meet the conditions specified in section II.B.5(a)(9) of this Appendix A), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Makes or assumes credit-enhancing representations and warranties with respect to the loans serviced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Clean-up calls on third party assets. Clean-up calls that are exercisable at the option of the bank (as servicer or as an affiliate of the servicer) when the pool balance is 10 percent or less of the original pool balance are not direct credit substitutes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Eligible ABCP liquidity facility means a liquidity facility supporting ABCP, in form or in substance, that is subject to an asset quality test at the time of draw that precludes funding against assets that are 90 days or more past due or in default. In addition, if the assets that an eligible ABCP liquidity facility is required to fund against are externally rated assets or exposures at the inception of the facility, the facility can be used to fund only those assets or exposures that are externally rated investment grade at the time of funding. Notwithstanding the eligibility requirements set forth in the two preceding sentences, a liquidity facility will be considered an eligible ABCP liquidity facility if the assets that are funded under the liquidity facility and which do not meet the eligibility requirements are guaranteed, either conditionally or unconditionally, by the U.S. government or its agencies, or by the central government of an OECD country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Externally rated means that an instrument or obligation has received a credit rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Face amount means the notional principal, or face value, amount of an off-balance sheet item; the amortized cost of an asset not held for trading purposes; and the fair value of a trading asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Financial asset means cash or other monetary instrument, evidence of debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that conveys a right to receive or exchange cash or another financial instrument from another party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Financial standby letter of credit means a letter of credit or similar arrangement that represents an irrevocable obligation to a third-party beneficiary:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To receive money borrowed by, or advanced to, or advanced to, or for the account of, a second party (the account party), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To make payment on behalf of the account party, in the event that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Liquidity facility means a legally binding commitment to provide liquidity support to ABCP by lending to, or purchasing assets from, any structure, program, or conduit in the event that funds are required to repay maturing ABCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Mortgage servicer cash advance means funds that a residential mortgage servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the loan. A mortgage servicer cash advance is not a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The mortgage servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying asset pool; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal of that loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) means an entity recognized by the Division of Market Regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor Division) (Commission) as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for various purposes, including the Commission's uniform net capital requirements for brokers and dealers (17 CFR 240.15c3-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Recourse means an arrangement in which a bank retains, in form or in substance, of any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with an asset it has sold (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank's claim on the asset. If a bank has no claim on an asset it has sold, then the retention of any credit risk is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises when an institution transfers assets in a sale and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse may exist implicitly where a bank provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold. The following are examples of recourse arrangements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on the transferred assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under which the bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is responsible for making mortgage servicer cash advances (unless the advances are not a recourse obligation because they meet the conditions specified in section II.B.5(a)(11) of this Appendix A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are not already included on the balance sheet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity of the transferred portion of the loan is shorter than the maturity of the commitment under which the loan is drawn;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Credit derivative contracts under which the bank retains more than its pro rata share of credit risk on transferred assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Clean-up calls at inception that are greater than 10 percent of the balance of the original pool of transferred loans. Clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance that are exercisable at the option of the bank are not recourse arrangements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii.)</em> Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Residual interest means any on-balance sheet asset that represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)) of financial assets, whether through a securitization or otherwise, and that exposes a bank to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred assets that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank's claim on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques. Residual interests generally include credit-enhancing I/Os, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests, other forms of over-collateralization, and similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the bank to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold. Residual interests generally do not include interests purchased from a third party, except that purchased credit-enhancing I/Os are residual interests for purposes of the risk-based capital treatment in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Risk participation means a participation in which the originating party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of an obligation (e.g., a direct credit substitute) notwithstanding that another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Securitization means the pooling and repackaging by a special purpose entity of assets or other credit exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and commitments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Sponsor means a bank that establishes an ABCP program; approves the sellers permitted to participate in the program; approves the asset pools to be purchased by the program; or administers the ABCP program by monitoring the assets, arranging for debt placement, compiling monthly reports, or ensuring compliance with the program documents and with the program's credit and investment policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Structured finance program means a program where receivable interests and asset-backed securities issued by multiple participants are purchased by a special purpose entity that repackages those exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Structured finance programs allocate credit risks, generally, between the participants and credit enhancement provided to the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Traded position means a position that is externally rated and is retained, assumed or issued in connection with an asset securitization, where there is a reasonable

expectation that, in the near future, the rating will be relied upon by unaffiliated investors to purchase the position; or an unaffiliated third party to enter into a transaction involving the position, such as a purchase, loan, or repurchase agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Credit equivalent amounts and risk weights of recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes--(1) General rule for determining the credit-equivalent amount. Except as otherwise provided, the credit-equivalent amount for a recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the bank directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk multiplied by a 100% conversion factor. Thus, a bank that extends a partial direct credit substitute, e.g., a financial standby letter of credit that absorbs the first 10 percent of loss on a transaction, must maintain capital against the full amount of the assets being supported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule for determining the credit-equivalent amount. Except as otherwise provided, the credit-equivalent amount for a recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the bank directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk multiplied by a 100% conversion factor. Thus, a bank that extends a partial direct credit substitute, e.g., a financial standby letter of credit that absorbs the first 10 percent of loss on a transaction, must maintain capital against the full amount of the assets being supported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk-weight factor. To determine the bank's risk-weighted assets for an off-balance sheet recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute, the credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral. For a direct credit substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset, e.g., a purchased subordinated security, a bank must calculate risk-weighted assets using the amount of the direct credit substitute and the full amount of the assets it supports, i.e., all the more senior positions in the structure. The treatment covered in this paragraph (b) is subject to the low-level exposure rule provided in section II.B.5(h)(1) of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit equivalent amount and risk weight of participations in, and syndications of, direct credit substitutes. Subject to the low-level exposure rule provided in section II.B.5(h)(1) of this appendix A, the credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in, or syndication of, a direct credit substitute (excluding purchased credit-enhancing interest-only strips) is calculated and risk weighted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment for direct credit substitutes for which a bank has conveyed a risk participation. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a bank has conveyed a risk participation, the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute is converted to a credit equivalent amount using a 100% conversion factor. However, the pro rata share of the credit equivalent amount that has been conveyed through a

The pro rata share of the credit equivalent amount that has not been participated out is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor, or collateral. For example, the pro rata share of the full amount of the assets supported, in whole or in part, by a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic depository institution or an OECD bank is assigned to the 20 percent risk category.13</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment for direct credit substitutes in which the bank has acquired a risk participation. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which the bank has acquired a risk participation, the acquiring bank's pro rata share of the direct credit substitute is multiplied by the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute and converted using a 100% credit conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment for direct credit substitutes related to syndications. In the case of a direct credit substitute that takes the form of a syndication where each party is obligated only for its pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating entity, each bank's credit equivalent amount will be calculated by multiplying only its pro rata share of the assets supported by the direct credit substitute by a 100% conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Externally rated positions: credit-equivalent amounts and risk weights--(1) Traded positions.

In order to rely on a program rating, the bank must demonstrate to the FDIC's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating traded positions. The bank must also demonstrate to the

FDIC's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the NRSRO's assignment of ratings for the program are satisfied for the particular position issued by the bank. If a bank participates in a securitization sponsored by another party, the FDIC may authorize the bank to use this approach based on a program rating obtained by the sponsor of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computer Program. A bank is using an acceptable credit assessment computer program that has been developed by an NRSRO to determine the rating of a direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not a residual interest) extended in connection with a structured finance program. In order to rely on the rating determined by the computer program, the bank must demonstrate to the FDIC's satisfaction that ratings under the program correspond credibly and reliably with the ratings of traded positions.

The remainder of the SBIC's adjusted carrying value (i.e., the minority interest holders' proportionate share) is excluded from the risk-weighted assets of the bank. If a bank has an investment in a SBIC that is not consolidated for accounting purposes and has current information that identifies the percentage of the SBIC's assets that are equity investments in nonfinancial companies, the bank may reduce the adjusted carrying value of its investment in the SBIC proportionately to reflect the percentage of the adjusted carrying value of the SBIC's assets that are not equity investments in nonfinancial companies.

No deduction under this section II.B.(6) is required to be made with respect to the adjusted carrying value of any nonfinancial equity investment (or portion of such an investment) that was made by the bank prior to March 13, 2000, or that was made by the bank after such date pursuant to a binding written commitment \20\ entered into prior to March 13, 2000, provided that in either case the bank has continuously held the investment since the relevant investment date. \21\ For purposes of this section II.B.(6)(v) a nonfinancial equity investment made prior to March 13, 2000, includes

any shares or other interests received by the bank through a stock split or stock dividend on an investment made prior to March 13, 2000, provided the bank provides no consideration for the shares or interests received and the transaction does not materially increase the bank's proportional interest in the company. The exercise on or after March 13, 2000, of options or warrants acquired prior to March 13, 2000, is not considered to be an investment made prior to March 13, 2000, if the bank provides any consideration for the shares or interests received upon exercise of the options or warrants. Any nonfinancial equity investment (or portion thereof) that is not required to be deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.(6)(v) must be included in determining the total amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank in relation to its Tier 1 capital for purposes of the table in section II.B.(6)(iii)(A).

For example, for equity investments held as available-for-sale (AFS), the adjusted carrying value of the investments would be the aggregate carrying value of those investments (as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the bank) less any unrealized gains on those investments that are included in other comprehensive income and not reflected in Tier 1 capital, and associated deferred tax liabilities. \22\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this appendix A.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As discussed above with respect to consolidated SBICs, some equity investments may be in companies that are consolidated for accounting purposes.

The U.S. central bank includes the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The definition of central government does not include state, provincial or local governments or commercial enterprises owned by the central government. In addition, it does not include local government entities or commercial enterprises whose obligations are guaranteed by the central government. OECD central governments are defined as central governments of the OECD-based group of countries. Non-OECD central governments are defined as central governments of countries that do not belong to the OECD-based group of countries.</p><p class="depth0">\26\ For risk-based capital purposes U.S. Government agency is defined as an instrumentality of the U.S. Government whose debt obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. These agencies include the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Veterans Administration (VA), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Farmers Home Administration (FHA), the Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank), the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Small Business Administration (SBA).

The definition encompasses banks, mutual or stock savings banks, savings or building and loan associations, cooperative banks, credit unions, international banking facilities of domestic depository institutions, and U.S.-chartered depository institutions owned by foreigners. However, this definition excludes branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the U.S. and bank holding companies.</p><p class="depth0">\29\ Foreign banks are distinguished as either OECD banks or non-OECD banks. OECD banks include banks and their branches (foreign and domestic) organized under the laws of countries (other than the U.S.) that belong to the OECD-based group of countries. Non-OECD banks include banks and their branches (foreign and domestic) organized under the laws of countries that do not belong to the OECD-based group of countries. For risk-based capital purposes, a bank is defined as an institution that engages in the business of banking; is recognized as a bank by the bank supervisory or monetary authorities of the country of its organization or principal banking operations; receives deposits to a substantial extent in the regular course of business; and has the power to accept demand deposits.</p><p class="depth0">\30\ Long-term claims on, or guaranteed by, non-OECD banks and all claims on bank holding companies are assigned to the 100 percent risk weight category, as are holdings of bank-issued securities that qualify as capital of the issuing banks for risk-based capital purposes.</p><p class="depth0">\31\ Claims on a qualifying securities firm that are instruments the firm, or its parent company, uses to satisfy its applicable capital requirements are not eligible for this risk weight.</p><p class="depth0">\32\ With regard to securities firms incorporated in the United States, qualifying securities firms are those securities firms that are broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are in compliance with the SEC's net capital rule, 17 CFR 240.15c3-1. With regard to securities firms incorporated in any other country in the OECD-based group of countries, qualifying securities firms are those securities firms that a bank is able to demonstrate are subject to consolidated supervision and regulation (covering their direct and indirect subsidiaries, but not necessarily their parent organizations) comparable to that imposed on banks in OECD countries. Such regulation must include risk-based capital requirements comparable to those applied to banks under the Accord on International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (1988, as amended in 1998) (Basel Accord). Claims on a qualifying securities firm that are instruments the firm, or its parent company, uses to satisfy its applicable capital requirements are not eligible for this risk weight and are generally assigned to at least a 100 percent risk weight. In addition, certain claims on qualifying securities firms are eligible for a zero percent risk weight if the claims are collateralized by cash on deposit in the lending bank or by securities issued or guaranteed by the United States or OECD central governments (including U.S. government agencies), provided that a positive margin of collateral is required to be maintained on such a claim on a daily basis, taking into account any change in a bank's exposure to the obligor or counterparty under the claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of the claim.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is a reverse repurchase/repurchase agreement or securities lending/borrowing transaction executed using standard industry documentation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is collateralized by debt or equity securities that are liquid and readily marketable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is marked-to-market daily;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement under the standardized documentation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Can be liquidated, terminated, or accelerated immediately in bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the security or collateral agreement will not be stayed or avoided, under applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction. \33\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\33\ For example, a claim is exempt from the automatic stay in bankruptcy in the United States if it arises under a securities contract or a repurchase agreement subject to section 555 or 559 of the Bankruptcy Code, respectively (11 U.S.C. 555 or 559), a qualified financial contract under section 11(e)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)), or a netting contract between financial institutions under sections 401-407 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (12 U.S.C. 4401-4407), or the Board's Regulation EE (12 CFR part 231).

Also included in the 20 percent risk category are portions of claims that are conditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments and U.S. Government agencies, \35\ as well as portions of local currency claims that are conditionally guaranteed by non-OECD central governments to the extent that the bank has liabilities booked in that currency.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\34\ For risk-based capital purposes, U.S. Government-sponsored agencies are defined as agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. Government to serve public purposes specified by the U.S. Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. These agencies include the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and the Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA). For risk-based capital purposes, claims on U.S. Government-sponsored agencies also include capital stock in a Federal Home Loan Bank that is held as a condition of membership in that Bank.</p><p class="depth0">\35\ For risk-based capital purposes, a conditional guarantee is deemed to exist if the validity of the guarantee by the OECD central government or the U.S. Government agency is dependent upon some affirmative action (e.g., servicing requirements on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee).

These properties may be either owner-occupied or rented. In addition, for risk-based capital purposes, loans secured

by one-to-four family residential properties include loans to builders with substantial project equity for the construction of one-to-four family residences that have been presold under firm contracts to purchasers who have obtained firm commitments for permanent qualifying mortgage loans and have made substantial earnest money deposits. Such loans to builders will be considered prudently underwritten only if the bank has obtained sufficient documentation that the buyer of the home intends to purchase the home (i.e., has a legally binding written sales contract) and has the ability to obtain a mortgage loan sufficient to purchase the home (i.e., has a firm written commitment for permanent financing of the home upon completion), provided the following criteria are met:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\37\ If a bank holds the first and junior lien(s) on a residential property and no other party holds an intervening lien, the transactions are treated as a single loan secured by a first lien for purposes of determining the loan-to-value ratio and assigning a risk weight.</p><p class="depth0">\38\ For risk-based capital purposes, the loan-to-value ratio generally is based upon the most current appraised value of the property.

Conversion Factors for Off-Balance Sheet Items (see Table III)</p><p class="depth0">The face amount of an off-balance sheet item is generally incorporated into the risk-weighted assets in two steps. The face amount is first multiplied by a credit conversion factor, except as otherwise specified in section II.B.5 of this appendix A for direct credit substitutes and recourse obligations.

On the other hand, if a bank lends its own securities or, acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor or, if applicable, to the collateral delivered to the lending bank or the independent custodian acting on the lending bank's behalf.</p><p class="depth0">2. Items With a 50 Percent Conversion Factor. a. Transaction-related contingencies are to be converted at 50 percent. Such contingencies include bid bonds, performance bonds, warranties, and performance standby letters of credit related to particular transactions, as well as acquisitions of risk participations in performance standby letters of credits. Performance standby letters of credit (performance bonds) are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) fails to perform on some contractual nonfinancial obligation. Thus, performance standby letters of credit represent obligations backing the performance of nonfinancial or commercial contracts or undertakings. To the extent permitted by law or regulation, performance standby letters of credit include arrangements backing, among other things, subcontractors' and suppliers' performance, labor and materials contracts, and construction bids.</p><p class="depth0">b. The unused portion of commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year, including underwriting commitments and commercial and consumer credit commitments, also are to be converted at 50 percent. Original maturity is defined as the length of time between the date the commitment is issued and the earliest date on which: (1) The bank can at its option, unconditionally (without cause) cancel the commitment, \48\ and (2) the bank is scheduled to (and as a normal practice actually does) review the facility to determine whether or not it should be extended and, on at least an annual basis, continues to regularly review the facility. Facilities that are unconditionally cancelable (without cause) at any time by the bank are not deemed to be commitments, provided the bank makes a separate credit decision before each drawing under the facility.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\48\ In the case of home equity or mortgage lines of credit secured by liens on one-to-four family residential properties, a bank is deemed able to unconditionally cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can prohibit additional extensions of credit, reduce the credit line, and terminate the commitment to the full extent permitted by relevant Federal law.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c.i. Commitments are defined as any legally binding arrangements that obligate a bank to extend credit in the form of loans or lease financing receivables; to purchase

loans, securities, or other assets; or to participate in loans and leases. Commitments also include overdraft facilities, revolving credit, home equity and mortgage lines of credit, eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, and similar transactions. Normally, commitments involve a written contract or agreement and a commitment fee, or some other form of consideration. Commitments are included in weighted-risk assets regardless of whether they contain material adverse change clauses or other provisions that are intended to relieve the issuer of its funding obligation under certain conditions. In the case of commitments structured as syndications, where the bank is obligated solely for its pro rata share, only the bank's proportional share of the syndicated commitment is taken into account in calculating the risk-based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Banks that are subject to the market risk rules in appendix C to part 325 are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of over one year that are carried in the trading account at 50 percent to determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that support ABCP, in form or in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of appendix C of this part) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes, and assessed the appropriate risk-based capital treatment in accordance with section II.B.5. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">d. In the case of commitments structured as syndications where the bank is obligated only for its pro rata share, the risk-based capital framework includes only the bank's proportional share of such commitments. Thus, after a commitment has been converted at 50 percent, portions of commitments that have been conveyed to other U.S. depository institutions or OECD banks, but for which the originating bank retains the full obligation to the borrower if the participating bank fails to pay when the commitment is drawn upon, will be assigned to the 20 percent risk category. The acquisition of such a participation in a commitment would be converted at 50 percent and the credit equivalent amount would be assigned to the risk category that is appropriate for the account party obligor or, if relevant, to the nature of the collateral or guarantees.</p><p class="depth0">e. Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance facilities (NIFs), and other similar arrangements also are converted at 50 percent. These are facilities under which a borrower can issue on a revolving basis short-term notes in its own name, but for which the underwriting banks have a legally binding commitment either to purchase any notes the borrower is unable to sell by the rollover date or to advance funds to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">3. Items With a 20 Percent Conversion Factor. Short-term, self-liquidating, trade-related contingencies which arise from the movement of goods are converted at 20 percent. Such contingencies include commercial letters of credit and other documentary letters of credit collateralized by the underlying shipments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Items With a 10 Percent Conversion Factor. a. Unused portions of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year or less that provide liquidity support to ABCP also are converted at 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">b. Banks that are subject to the market risk rules in appendix C to part 325 are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of one year or less that are carried in the trading account at 10 percent to determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP, in form or in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of appendix C of this part) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes and assessed the appropriate risk-based capital requirement in accordance with section II.B.5. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5.

At 76 FR 37629, June 28, 2011, appendix A to part 325 was amended, however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to the inaccurate amendatory instruction. The new footnote 45 could not be added because there was no text for a new 45 to incorporate.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 325--Statement of Policy on Capital Adequacy</p><p class="depth0">Part 325 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation rules and regulations (12 CFR part 325) sets forth minimum leverage capital requirements for fundamentally sound, well-managed banks having no material or significant financial weaknesses. It also defines capital and sets forth sanctions which will be used against banks which are in violation of the part 325 regulation. This statement of policy on capital adequacy provides some interpretational and definitional guidance as to how this part 325 regulation will be administered and enforced by the FDIC. This statement of policy also addresses certain aspects of the FDIC's minimum risk-based capital guidelines that are set forth in appendix A to part 325. This statement of policy does not address the prompt corrective action provisions mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. However, section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and subpart B of part 325 provide guidance on the prompt corrective action provisions, which generally apply to institutions with inadequate levels of capital.</p><p class="depth0">I. Enforcement of Minimum Capital Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.3(b)(1) specifies that FDIC-supervised, state-chartered nonmember commercial and savings banks (or other insured depository institutions making applications to the FDIC that require the FDIC to consider the adequacy of the institutions' capital structure) must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 (or core) capital to total assets of at least 3 percent; however, this minimum only applies to the most highly-rated banks (i.e., those with a composite CAMELS rating of 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth. All other state nonmember banks would need to meet a minimum leverage ratio that is at least 100 to 200 basis points above this minimum. That is, in accordance with Sec. 325.3(b)(2), an absolute minimum leverage ratio of not less than 4 percent must be maintained by those banks that are not highly-rated or that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the minimum leverage capital standards, section III of appendix A to part 325 indicates that state nonmember banks generally are expected to maintain a minimum risk-based capital ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8 percent, with at least one-half of that total capital amount consisting of Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">State nonmember banks (hereinafter referred to as ``banks'') operating with leverage capital ratios below the minimums set forth in part 325 will be deemed to have inadequate capital and will be in violation of the part 325 regulation. Furthermore, banks operating with risk-based capital ratios below the minimums set forth in appendix A to part 325 generally will be deemed to have inadequate capital. Banks failing to meet the minimum leverage and/or risk-based capital

ratios normally can expect to have any application submitted to the FDIC denied (if such application requires the FDIC to evaluate the adequacy of the institution's capital structure) and also can expect to be subject to the use of capital directives or other formal enforcement action by the FDIC to increase capital.</p><p class="depth0">Capital adequacy in banks which have capital ratios at or above the minimums will be assessed and enforced based on the following factors (these same criteria will apply to any insured depository institutions making applications to the FDIC and to any other circumstances in which the FDIC is requested or required to evaluate the adequacy of a depository institution's capital structure):</p><p class="depth0">A. Banks Which Are Fundamentally Sound and Well-Managed</p><p class="depth0">The minimum leverage capital ratios set forth in Sec. 325.3(b)(2) and the minimum risk-based capital ratios set forth in section III of appendix A to part 325 generally will be viewed as the minimum acceptable capital standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound, which are well-managed and which have no material or significant financial weaknesses. While the FDIC will make this determination in each bank based upon its own condition and specific circumstances, this definition will generally apply to those banks evidencing a level of risk which is no greater than that normally associated with a Composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Banks meeting this definition which are in compliance with the minimum leverage and risk-based capital ratio standards will not generally be required by the FDIC to raise new capital from external sources.</p><p class="depth0">The FDIC does, however, encourage such banks to maintain capital well above the minimums, particularly those institutions that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth, and will carefully evaluate their earnings and growth trends, dividend policies, capital planning procedures and other factors important to the continuous maintenance of adequate capital. Adverse trends or deficiencies in these areas will be subject to criticism at regular examinations and may be an important factor in the FDIC's action on applications submitted by such banks. In addition, the FDIC's consideration of capital adequacy in banks making applications to the FDIC will also fully examine the expected impact of those applications on the bank's ability to maintain its capital adequacy. In all cases, banks should maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of risks, including the volume and severity of adversely classified assets, to which they are exposed.</p><p class="depth0">B. All Other Banks</p><p class="depth0">Banks not meeting the definition set forth in I.A. of this appendix, that is, banks evidencing a level of risk which is at least as great as that normally associated with a Composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, will be required to maintain capital higher than the minimum regulatory requirement and at a level deemed appropriate in relation to the degree of risk within the institution. These higher capital levels will normally be addressed through memorandums of understanding between the FDIC and the bank or, in cases of more pronounced risk, through the use of formal enforcement actions under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).</p><p class="depth0">C. Capital Requirements of Primary Regulator</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding I.A. and B. of this appendix, all banks (or other depository institutions making applications to the FDIC that require the FDIC to consider the adequacy of the institutions' capital structure) will be expected to meet any capital requirements established by their primary state or federal regulator which exceed the minimum capital requirement set forth in the FDIC's part 325 regulation. In addition, the FDIC will, when establishing capital requirements higher than the minimum set forth in the regulation, consult with an institution's primary state or federal regulator.</p><p class="depth0">II. Capital Plans</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.4(b) specifies that any bank which has less than its minimum leverage capital requirement is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice unless it has submitted, and is in compliance with, a plan approved by the FDIC to increase its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio to such level as the FDIC deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">As required under Sec. 325.104(a)(1) of this part, a bank must file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate FDIC regional director within 45 days of the date that the bank receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the bank is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, unless the FDIC notifies the bank in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. The amount of time allowed to achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement will be evaluated by the FDIC on a case-by-case basis and will depend on a number of factors, including the viability of the bank and whether it is fundamentally sound and well-managed.</p><p class="depth0">Banks evidencing more than normal levels of risk will normally have their minimum capital requirements established in a formal or informal enforcement proceeding. The time frames for meeting these requirements

will be set forth in such actions and will generally require some immediate action on the bank's part to meet its minimum capital requirement. The reasonableness of capital plans submitted by depository institutions in connection with applications as provided for in Sec. 325.3(d)(2) will be determined in conjunction with the FDIC's consideration of the application.</p><p class="depth0">III. Written Agreements</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.4(c) provides that any insured depository institution with a Tier 1 capital to total assets (leverage) ratio of less than 2 percent must enter into and be in compliance with a written agreement with the FDIC (or with its primary federal regulator with FDIC as a party to the agreement) to increase its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio to such level as the FDIC deems appropriate or may be subject to a section 8(a) termination of insurance action by the FDIC. Except in the very rarest of circumstances, the FDIC will require that such agreements contemplate immediate efforts by the depository institution to acquire the required capital.</p><p class="depth0">The guidance in this section III is not intended to preclude the FDIC from taking section 8(a) or other enforcement action against any institution, regardless of its capital level, if the specific circumstances deem such action to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Capital Components</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.2 sets forth the definition of Tier 1 capital for the leverage standard as well as the definitions for the various instruments and accounts which are included therein. Although nonvoting common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries are normally included in Tier 1 capital, voting common stockholders' equity generally will be expected to be the dominant form of Tier 1 capital. Thus, banks should avoid undue reliance on nonvoting equity, preferred stock and minority interests. The following provides some additional guidance with respect to some of the items that affect the calculation of Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">A. Intangible Assets</p><p class="depth0">The FDIC permits state nonmember banks to record intangible assets on their books and to report the value of such assets in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (``Call Report''). As noted in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (published by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council), intangible assets may arise from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method and acquisitions of portions or segments of another institution's business, such as branch offices, mortgage servicing portfolios, and credit card portfolios.</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the authority to report all intangible assets in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income,Sec. 325.2(v) of the regulation specifies that mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships are the only intangible assets which will be allowed as Tier 1 capital. \1\ The portion of equity capital represented by other types of intangible assets will be deducted from equity capital and assets in the computation of a bank's Tier 1 capital. Certain of these intangible assets may, however, be recognized for regulatory capital purposes if explicitly approved by the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) as part of the bank's regulatory capital on a specific case basis. These intangibles will be included in regulatory capital under the terms and conditions that are specifically approved by the FDIC. \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Although intangible assets in the form of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships are generally recognized for regulatory capital purposes, the--deduction of part or all of the mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships may be required if the carrying amounts of these rights are excessive in relation to their market value or the level of the bank's capital accounts. In this regard, mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships will be recognized for regulatory capital purposes only to the extent the rights meet the conditions, limitations and restrictions described in Sec. 325.5(f).</p><p class="depth0">\2\ This specific approval must be received in accordance with Sec. 325.5(b). In evaluating whether other types of intangibles should be recognized for regulatory capital purposes, the FDIC will accord special attention to the general characteristics of the intangibles, including: (1) The separability of the intangible asset and the ability to sell it separate and apart from the bank or the bulk of the bank's assets, (2) the certainty that a readily identifiable stream of cash flows associated with the intangible asset can hold its value notwithstanding the future prospects of the bank, and (3) the existence of a market of sufficient depth to provide liquidity for the intangible asset. However, pursuant to section 18(n) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(n)), specific approval cannot be given for an unidentifiable intangible asset, such as goodwill, if acquired after April 12, 1989.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In certain instances banks may have investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries or

joint ventures that have large volumes of intangible assets. In such instances the bank's consolidated statements will reflect an investment in a tangible asset even though such investment will, in fact, be represented by a large volume of intangible assets. In any such situation where this is material, the bank's investment in the unconsolidated subsidiary will be divided into a tangible and an intangible portion based on the percentage of intangible assets to total assets in the subsidiary. The intangible portion of the investment will be treated as if it were an intangible asset on the bank's books in the calculation of Tier 1 capital. However, intangible assets in the form of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships, including servicing intangibles held by mortgage banking subsidiaries, are subject to the specific criteria set forth in Sec. 325.5(f).</p><p class="depth0">B. Perpetual Preferred Stock</p><p class="depth0">Perpetual preferred stock is defined as preferred stock that does not have a maturity date, that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder, and that has no other provisions that will require future redemption of the issue. Also, pursuant to section 18(i)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)), a state nonmember bank cannot, without the prior consent of the FDIC, reduce the amount or retire any part of its perferred stock. (This prior consent is also required for the reduction or retirement of any part of a state nonmember bank's common stock or capital notes and debentures.)</p><p class="depth0">Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock is generally included in Tier 1 capital. Nonetheless, it is possible for banks to issue preferred stock with a dividend rate which escalates to such a high rate that the terms become so onerous as to effectively force the bank to call the issue (for example, an issue with a low initial rate that is scheduled to escalate to much higher rates in subsequent periods). Preferred stock issues with such onerous terms have much the same characteristics as limited life preferred stock in that the bank would be effectively forced to redeem the issue to avoid performance of the onerous terms. Such instruments may be disallowed as Tier 1 capital and, for risk-based capital purposes, would be included in Tier 2 capital only to the extent that the instruments fall within the limitations applicable to intermediate-term preferred stock. Banks which are contemplating issues bearing terms which may be so characterized are encouraged to submit them to the appropriate FDIC regional office for review prior to issuance. Nothing herein shall prohibit banks from issuing floating rate preferred stock issues where the rate is constant in relation to some outside market or index rate. However, noncumulative floating rate instruments where the rate paid is based in some part on the current credit standing of the bank, and all cumulative preferred stock instruments, are excluded from Tier 1 capital. These instruments are included in Tier 2 capital for risk-based capital purposes in accordance with the limitations set forth in appendix A to part 325.</p><p class="depth0">The FDIC will also require that issues of perpetual preferred stock be consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Issues which would unduly enrich insiders or which contain dividend rates or other terms which are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices will likely be the subject of appropriate supervisory response from the FDIC. Banks contemplating preferred stock issues which may pose safety and soundness concerns are encouraged to submit such issues to the appropriate FDIC regional office for review prior to sale. Pursuant to Sec. 325.5(e), capital instruments that contain or that are subject to any conditions, covenants, terms, restrictions or provisions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices will not qualify as capital under part 325.</p><p class="depth0">C. Other Instruments or Transactions Which Fail To Provide Capital</p><p class="depth0">Support</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.5(b) specifies that any capital component or balance sheet entry or account which has characteristics or terms that diminish its contribution to an insured depository institution's ability to absorb losses shall be deducted from capital. An example involves certain types of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries have been included in capital based on the fact that they provide capital support to the risk in the consolidated subsidiaries. Certain transactions have been structured where a bank forms a subsidiary by transferring essentially risk-free or low-risk assets to the subsidiary in exchange for common stock of the subsidiary. The subsidiary then sells preferred stock to third parties.</p><p class="depth0">The preferred stock becomes a minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary but, in effect, represents an essentially risk-free or low-risk investment for the preferred stockholders. This type of minority interest fails to provide any meaningful capital support to the consolidated entity inasmuch as it has a preferred claim on the essentially risk-free or low-risk assets of the subsidiary. In addition, certain minority interests are not substantially equivalent to permanent equity in that the interests must be paid off on specified future dates, or at the option of the holders of the minority interests, or contain other provisions or features that limit the ability of the minority interests to effectively absorb losses. Capital instruments or

transactions of this nature which fail to absorb losses or provide meaningful capital support will be deducted from Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">D. Mandatory Convertible Debt</p><p class="depth0">Mandatory convertible debt securities are subordinated debt instruments that require the issuer to convert such instruments into common or perpetual preferred stock by a date at or before the maturity of the debt instruments. The maturity of these instruments must be 12 years or less and the instruments must also meet the other criteria set forth in appendix A to part 325. Mandatory convertible debt is excluded from Tier 1 capital but, for risk-based capital purposes, is included in Tier 2 capital as a ``hybrid capital instrument.''</p><p class="depth0">So-called ``equity commitment notes,'' which merely require a bank to sell common or perpetual preferred stock during the life of the subordinated debt obligation, are specifically excluded from the definition of mandatory convertible debt securities and are only included in Tier 2 capital under the risk-based capital framework to the extent that they satisfy the requirements and limitations for ``term subordinated debt'' set forth in appendix A to part 325.</p><p class="depth0">V. Analysis of Consolidated Companies</p><p class="depth0">In determining a bank's compliance with its minimum capital requirements the FDIC will, with two exceptions, generally utilize the bank's consolidated statements as defined in the instructions for the preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income.</p><p class="depth0">The first exception relates to securities subsidiaries of state nonmember banks which are subject to Sec. 337.4 of the FDIC's rules and regulations (12 CFR 337.4). Any subsidiary subject to this section must be a bona fide subsidiary which is adequately capitalized. In addition,Sec. 337.4(b)(3) requires that any insured state nonmember bank's investment in such a subsidiary shall not be counted towards the bank's capital. In those instances where the securities subsidiary is consolidated in the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition it will be necessary, for the purpose of calculating the bank's Tier 1 capital, to adjust the Consolidated Report of Condition in such a manner as to reflect the bank's investment in the securities subsidiary on the equity method. In this case, and in those cases where the securities subsidiary has not been consolidated, the investment in the subsidiary will then be deducted from the bank's capital and assets prior to calculation of the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio. (Where deemed appropriate, the FDIC may also consider deducting investments in other subsidiaries, either on a case-by-case basis or, as with securities subsidiaries, based on the general characteristics or functional nature of the subsidiaries.)</p><p class="depth0">The second exception relates to the treatment of subsidiaries of insured banks that are domestic depository institutions such as commercial banks, savings banks, or savings associations. These subsidiaries are not consolidated on a line-by-line basis with the insured bank parent in the bank parent's Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. Rather, the instructions for these reports provide that bank investments in such depository institution subsidiaries are to be reported on an unconsolidated basis in accordance with the equity method. Since the FDIC believes that the minimum capital requirements should apply to a bank's depository activities in their entirety, regardless of the form that the organization's corporate structure takes, it will be necessary, for the purpose of calculating the bank's Tier 1 leverage and total risk-based capital ratios, to adjust a bank parent's Consolidated Report of Condition to consolidate its domestic depository institution subsidiaries on a line-by-line basis. The financial statements of the subsidiary that are used for this consolidation must be prepared in the same manner as the Consolidated Report of Condition.</p><p class="depth0">The FDIC will, in determining the capital adequacy of a bank which is a member of a bank holding company or chain banking group, consider the degree of leverage and risks undertaken by the parent company or other affiliates. Where the level of risk in a holding company system is no more than normal and the consolidated company is adequately capitalized at all appropriate levels, the FDIC generally will not require additional capital in subsidiary banks under its supervision over and above that which would be required for the subsidiary bank on its own merit. In cases where a holding company or other affiliated banks (or other companies) evidence more than a normal degree of risk (either by virtue of the quality of their assets, the nature of the activities conducted, or other factors) or where the affiliated organizations are inadequately capitalized, the FDIC will consider the potential impact of the additional risk or excess leverage upon an individual bank to determine if such factors will likely result in excessive requirements for dividends, management fees, or other support to the holding company or affiliated organizations which would be detrimental to the bank. Where the excessive risk or leverage in such organizations is determined to be potentially detrimental to the bank's condition or its ability to maintain adequate capital, the FDIC may initiate appropriate supervisory action to limit the bank's ability to support its weaker affiliates and/or require higher than minimum capital ratios in the bank.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Applicability of Part 325 to Savings Associations</p><p class="depth0">Section 325.3(c) indicates that, where the FDIC is required to evaluate the adequacy of any depository institution's (including any savings association's) capital structure in conjunction with an application filed by the institution, the FDIC will not approve the application if the depository institution does not meet the minimum leverage capital requirement set forth in Sec. 325.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">Also,Sec. 325.4(b) states that, under certain conditions specified in section 8(t) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may take section 8(b)(1) and/or 8(c) enforcement action against a savings association that is deemed to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice on account of its inadequate capital structure. Section 325.4(c) further specifies that any insured depository institution with a Leverage ratio (as defined in part 325) of less than 2 percent is deemed to be operating in an unsafe or unsound condition pursuant to section 8(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), as the primary federal regulator of savings associations, has established minimum core capital leverage, tangible capital and risk-based capital requirements for savings associations (12 CFR part 567). In this regard, certain differences exist between the methods used by the OTS to calculate a savings association's capital and the methods set forth by the FDIC in part 325. These differences include, among others, the core capital treatment for investments in subsidiaries and for certain intangible assets.</p><p class="depth0">In determining whether a savings association's application should be approved pursuant to Sec. 325.3(c), or whether an unsafe or unsound practice or condition exists pursuant to Sec. Sec. 325.4(b) and 325.4(c), the FDIC will consider the extent of the savings association's capital as determined in accordance with part 325. However, the FDIC will also consider the extent to which a savings association is in compliance with (a) the minimum capital requirements set forth by the OTS, (b) any related capital plans for meeting the minimum capital requirements approved by the OTS, and/or (c) any other criteria deemed by the FDIC as appropriate based on the association's specific circumstances.

The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the bank's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of section 7 of this appendix. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the bank's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under section 9 of this appendix. A bank may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the bank includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The bank's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve--in no case less than six--to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the bank validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the bank must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.

Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the bank's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements.

For a bank that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the bank must either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate to the FDIC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the bank's trading portfolio over a full business cycle.

A bank that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under section 7(b) of this appendix using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the bank's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the FDIC, a bank may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the bank internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position.

The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a bank to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market.

To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a bank must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> KG is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using appendix A to this part. KG is expressed as a decimal value between zero and 1 (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of KG equal to .08).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures within the securitized pool that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph (b)(2) to the ending balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ninety days or more past due;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the process of foreclosure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Held as real estate owned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Has contractually deferred interest payments for 90 days or more; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Is in default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parameter A is the attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the bank to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the bank's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Parameter D is the detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are pari passu with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mechanics of the SSFA. KG and W are used to calculate KA, the augmented value of KG, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying pool of exposures. KA is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to KA determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to KA, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization position is greater than or equal to KA, the bank must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When A is less than KA and D is greater than KA, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average of 1.00 and KSSFA calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, but with the parameter A revised to be set equal to KA. For the purpose of this weighted-average calculation:

Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a bank believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the bank is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure policy.

A bank must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under part VI (unless the bank is treating the contract as a covered position under 12 CFR part 325, appendix C). In addition, if the bank is treating the contract as a covered position under 12 CFR part 325, appendix C and in certain other cases described in section 55 of this appendix, the bank must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Single OTC derivative contract.

The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 4. For purposes of calculating either the PFE under this paragraph or the gross PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. For any OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 4, the PFE must be calculated using the ``other'' conversion factors. A bank must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Conversion Factor Matrix for OTC Derivative Contracts \1\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Credit       Credit (non-</p><p class="depth0">Foreign      (investment-     investment-               Precious</p><p class="depth0">Remaining maturity \2\                     Interest    exchange rate       grade           grade       Equity  metals (except   Other</p><p class="depth0">rate        and gold        reference       reference                  gold)</p><p class="depth0">obligor) \3\      obligor)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One year or less.........................................        0.00            0.01             0.05            0.10     0.06            0.07     0.10Over one to five years...................................        0.005           0.05             0.05            0.10     0.08            0.07     0.12Over five years..........................................        0.015           0.075            0.05            0.10     0.10            0.08    0.15--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ For an OTC derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the</p><p class="depth0">derivative contract.\2\ For an OTC derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that</p><p class="depth0">the market value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.

A bank may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or single-product netting set of OTC derivatives by factoring the collateral into its LGD estimates for the contract or netting set.

The bank must substitute the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section for [Sigma]E in the equation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and must use a ten-business-day minimum holding period (TM = 10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Internal models methodology.

A bank that uses the internal models methodology for a particular transaction type (OTC derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for all transactions of that transaction type.

If the bank recognizes this reduction in exposure to the counterparty in its estimate of EE, it must also use its internal model to estimate a separate EAD for the bank's exposure to the protection provider of the credit derivative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To obtain FDIC approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, the bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the following minimum standards, with which the bank must maintain compliance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The bank must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The bank must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The bank must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The bank must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control specific wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. Wrong-way risk in this context is the risk that future exposure to a counterparty will be high when the counterparty's probability of default is also high.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. When estimating model parameters based on historical data, at least three years of historical data that cover a wide range of economic conditions must be used and must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The bank should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A bank must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process.

A bank may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. For this purpose, a collateral agreement means a legal contract that specifies the time when, and circumstances under which, the counterparty is required to pledge collateral to the bank for a single financial contract or for all financial contracts in a netting set and confers upon the bank a perfected, first priority security interest (notwithstanding the prior security interest of any custodial agent), or the legal equivalent thereof, in the collateral posted by the counterparty under the agreement. This security interest must provide the bank with a right to close out the financial positions and liquidate the collateral upon an event of default of, or failure to perform by, the counterparty under the collateral agreement. A contract would not satisfy this requirement if the bank's exercise of rights under the agreement may be stayed or avoided under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With prior written approval from the FDIC, a bank may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The bank may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk, upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is five business days

for repo-style transactions and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement. This period should be extended to cover any additional time between margin calls; any potential closeout difficulties; any delays in selling collateral, particularly if the collateral is illiquid; and any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A bank that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The threshold, defined as the exposure amount at which the counterparty is required to post collateral under the collateral agreement, if the threshold is positive, plus an add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk. The add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure beginning from current exposure of zero over the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk must be at least five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions subject to daily re-margining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for all other netting sets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective EPE without a collateral agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Own estimate of alpha. With prior written approval of the FDIC, a bank may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the bank must meet the following minimum standards to the satisfaction of the FDIC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The bank's own estimate of alpha must capture in the numerator the effects of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of market values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across counterparties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a concentration in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is driven by a particular risk factor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The bank must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The bank must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The bank must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other measures of counterparty exposure. With prior written approval of the FDIC, a bank may set EAD equal to a measure of counterparty credit risk exposure, such as peak EAD, that is more conservative than an alpha of 1.4 (or higher under the terms of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) times EPE for every counterparty whose EAD will be measured under the alternative measure of counterparty exposure. The bank must demonstrate the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure used for EAD. For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products, the bank may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this paragraph for a period not to exceed 180 days. For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the bank generally may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Section 33.

If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the bank (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the bank to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant. For example, where there is a step-up in cost in conjunction with a call feature or where the effective cost of protection increases over time even if credit quality remains the same or improves, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant will be the remaining time to the first call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When a maturity mismatch exists, the bank must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant: Pm = E x (t - 0.25)/(T - 0.25), where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> E = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> t = the lesser of T or the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant, expressed in years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> T = the lesser of five or the residual maturity of the hedged exposure, expressed in years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event.

Operational Criteria for Recognizing the Transfer of Risk</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Operational criteria for traditional securitizations. A bank that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (a) is satisfied. A bank that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. A bank that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The transfer is considered a sale under GAAP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bank has transferred to third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations. For synthetic securitizations, a bank may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A bank that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The credit risk mitigant is financial collateral, an eligible credit derivative from an eligible securitization guarantor or an eligible guarantee from an eligible securitization guarantor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bank transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require the bank to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the pool of underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increase the bank's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increase the yield payable to parties other than the bank in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the bank after the inception of the securitization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The bank obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.</p><p class="depth0">Section 42.

Under this approach, a bank may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories in Table 10 based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the bank's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the bank must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure class with the highest risk weight under Table 10, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure class with the next highest risk weight under Table 10 until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure class applies to an exposure, the bank must use the highest applicable risk weight. A bank may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Money Market Fund Approach. The risk-weighted asset amount for a bank's equity exposure to an investment fund that is a money market fund subject to 17 CFR 270.2a-7 and that has an applicable external rating in the highest investment-grade rating category equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Section 55. Equity Derivative Contracts</p><p class="depth0">Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an equity derivative contract under this part, a bank must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk-weighted asset amount for the contract under part IV. Under the SRWA, a bank may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a bank using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</p><p class="depth0">Part VII.
