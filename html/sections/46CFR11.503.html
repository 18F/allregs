                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engineer endorsements of all grades and types may be subject to  propulsion power limitations. Other than as provided in Sec. 11.524 of  this subpart for the designated duty engineer (DDE), the propulsion  power limitation placed on a license or MMC endorsement is based on the  applicant's qualifying experience considering the total shaft propulsion  power of each vessel on which the applicant has served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an applicant for an original or raise of grade of an  engineer endorsement, other than a DDE, has not obtained at least 50  percent of the required experience on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or  more, a propulsion power limitation is placed on the MMC based on the  applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement is limited to the  maximum propulsion power on which at least 25 percent of the required  experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum propulsion power  on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is  higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 HP/750 kW, using the next  higher figure when an intermediate horsepower is calculated. When the  limitation as calculated equals or exceeds 10,000 HP/7,500 kW, an  unlimited propulsion power endorsement is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following service on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more  will be considered qualifying for raising or removing the propulsion  power limitations placed on an engineer endorsement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Six months of service in the highest-grade endorsed: Removal of  all propulsion power limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Six months of service as an engineer officer in any capacity  other than the highest grade for which the applicant is licensed or  endorsed: Removal of all propulsion power limitations for the grade in  which service is performed and raised to the next higher grade  endorsement to the propulsion power of the vessel on which service was  performed. The total cumulative service before and after issuance of the  limited engineer endorsement may be considered in removing all  propulsion power limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Twelve months of service as oiler or junior engineer while  holding a license or MMC endorsement as third assistant engineer or  assistant engineer (limited): Removal of all propulsion power  limitations on third assistant engineer or assistant engineer's  (limited) endorsement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Six months of service as oiler or junior engineer while holding  a license or MMC endorsement as second assistant engineer: removal of  all propulsion power limitations on third assistant engineer's  endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Raising or removing propulsion power limitations based on  service required by paragraph (c) of this section may be granted without  further written examination, if the Coast Guard considers further  examination unnecessary.</p>
