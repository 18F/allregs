                                Sec.  202.20  Deposit of copies and phonorecords for copyright
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit of copies and phonorecords of published and unpublished works for the purpose of copyright registration under section 408 of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. The provisions of this section are not applicable to the deposit of copies and phonorecords for the Library of Congress under section 407 of title 17, except as expressly adopted in Sec.  202.19 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The best edition of a work has the meaning set forth in Sec.  202.19(b)(1). For purposes of this section, if a work is first published in both hard copy, i.e., in a physically tangible format, and also in an electronic format, the current Library of Congress Best Edition Statement requirements pertaining to the hard copy format apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A complete copy or phonorecord means the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unpublished works. Subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, a ``complete'' copy or phonorecord of an unpublished work is a copy or phonorecord representing the entire copyrightable content of the work for which registration is sought;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Published works. Subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) (iv) through (vii) of this section, a ``complete'' copy or phonorecord of a published work includes all elements comprising the applicable unit of publication of the work, including elements that, if considered separately, would not be copyrightable subject matter. However, even where certain physically separable elements included in the applicable unit of publication are missing

from the deposit, a copy or phonorecord will be considered ``complete'' for purposes of registration where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The copy or phonorecord deposited contains all parts of the work for which copyright registration is sought; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The removal of the missing elements did not physically damage the copy or phonorecord or garble its contents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The work is exempt from the mandatory deposit requirements under section 407 of title 17 of the United States Code and Sec.  202.19(c) of these regulations, or the copy deposited consists entirely of a container, wrapper, or holder, such as an envelope, sleeve, jacket, slipcase, box, bag, folder, binder, or other receptacle acceptable for deposit under paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Works submitted for registration in digital formats. A `complete' electronically filed work is one which is embodied in a digital file which contains:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> if the work is unpublished, all authorship elements for which registration is sought; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> if the work is published solely in an electronic format, all elements constituting the work in its published form, i.e., the complete work as published, including metadata and authorship for which registration is not sought. Publication in an electronic only format requires submission of the digital file[s] in exact first-publication form and content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For works submitted electronically, any of the following file formats are acceptable for registration: PDF; TXT; WPD; DOC; TIF; SVG; JPG; XML; HTML; WAV; and MPEG family of formats, including MP3. This list of file formats is non-exhaustive and it may change, or be added to periodically. Changes will be noted in the list of acceptable formats on the Copyright Office website.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Contact with the registration applicant may be necessary if the Copyright Office cannot access, view, or examine the content of any particular digital file that has been submitted for the registration of a work. For purposes of section 410(d) of 17 U.S.C., a deposit has not been received in the Copyright Office until a copy that can be reviewed by the Office is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Contributions to collective works. In the case of a published contribution to a collective work, a ``complete'' copy is one complete copy of the best edition of the entire collective work, the complete section containing the contribution if published in a newspaper, the contribution cut from the paper in which it appeared, or a photocopy of the contribution itself as it was published in the collective work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sound recordings. In the case of published sound recordings, a ``complete'' phonorecord has the meaning set forth in Sec.  202.19(b)(2) of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Musical scores. In the case of a musical composition published in copies only, or in both copies and phonorecords:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the only publication of copies took place by the rental, lease, or lending of a full score and parts, a full score is a ``complete'' copy; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the only publication of copies took place by the rental, lease, or lending of a conductor's score and parts, a conductor's score is a ``complete'' copy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Motion pictures. In the case of a published or unpublished motion picture, a copy is ``complete'' if the reproduction of all of the visual and aural elements comprising the copyrightable subject matter in the work is clean, undamaged, undeteriorated, and free of splices, and if the copy itself and its physical housing are free of any defects that would interfere with the performance of the work or that would cause mechanical, visual, or audible defects or distortions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The terms architectural works, copy, collective work, device, fixed, literary work, machine, motion picture, phonorecord, publication, sound recording, transmission program, and useful article, and their variant forms, have the meanings given to them in 17 U.S.C. 101.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A secure test is a nonmarketed test administered under supervision at specified centers on specific dates, all copies of which are accounted for and either destroyed or returned to restricted locked storage following each administration. For these purposes a test is not marketed if copies are not

sold but it is distributed and used in such a manner that ownership and control of copies remain with the test sponsor or publisher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Title 17 means title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For the purposes of determining the applicable deposit requirements under this Sec.  202.20 only, the following shall be considered as unpublished motion pictures: motion pictures that consist of television transmission programs and that have been published, if at all, only by reason of a license or other grant to a nonprofit institution of the right to make a fixation of such programs directly from a transmission to the public, with or without the right to make further uses of such fixations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nature of required deposit. (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the deposit required to accompany an application for registration of claim to copyright under section 408 of title 17 shall consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of unpublished works, one complete copy or phonorecord.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of works first published in the United States before January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the work as first published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of works first published in the United States on or after January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the best edition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of works first published outside of the United States, one complete copy or phonorecord of the work either as first published or of the best edition. For purposes of this section, any works simultaneously first published within and outside of the United States shall be considered to be first published in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of certain works, the special provisions set forth in this clause shall apply. In any case where this clause specifies that one copy or phonorecord may be submitted, that copy or phonorecord shall represent the best edition, or the work as first published, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. In the following cases the deposit of one complete copy or phonorecord will suffice in lieu of two copies or phonorecords:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Published three-dimensional cartographic representations of area, such as globes and relief models;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Published diagrams illustrating scientific or technical works or formulating scientific or technical information in linear or other two-dimensional form, such as an architectural or engineering blueprint, or a mechanical drawing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Published greeting cards, picture postcards, and stationery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Lectures, sermons, speeches, and addresses published individually and not as a collection of the works of one or more authors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Musical compositions published in copies only, or in both copies and phonorecords, if the only publication of copies took place by rental, lease, or lending;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Published multimedia kits or any part thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Works exempted from the requirement of depositing identifying material under paragraph (c)(2)(xi)(B)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Literary, dramatic, and musical works published only as embodied in phonorecords, although this category does not exempt the owner of copyright in a sound recording;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Choreographic works, pantomimes, literary, dramatic, and musical works published only as embodied in motion pictures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Published works in the form of two-dimensional games, decals, fabric patches or emblems, calendars, instructions for needle work, needle work and craft kits; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Works reproduced on three-dimensional containers such as boxes, cases, and cartons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Motion pictures. In the case of published or unpublished motion pictures, the deposit of one complete copy will suffice. The deposit of a copy or copies for any published or unpublished motion picture must be accompanied by a separate description of its contents, such as a continuity, pressbook, or synopsis. In any case where the deposit copy or copies required for registration of a motion picture cannot be viewed for examining purposes on

equipment in the Registration Program of the Copyright Office, the description accompanying the deposit must comply with Sec.  202.21(h) of these regulations. The Library of Congress may, at its sole discretion, enter into an agreement permitting the return of copies of published motion pictures to the depositor under certain conditions and establishing certain rights and obligations of the Library of Congress with respect to such copies. In the event of termination of such an agreement by the Library, it shall not be subject to reinstatement, nor shall the depositor or any successor in interest of the depositor be entitled to any similar or subsequent agreement with the Library, unless at the sole discretion of the Library it would be in the best interests of the Library to reinstate the agreement or enter into a new agreement. In the case of unpublished motion pictures (including television transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the public, but have not been published), the deposit of identifying material in compliance with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations may be made and will suffice in lieu of an actual copy. In the case of colorized versions of motion pictures made from pre-existing black and white motion pictures, in addition to the deposit of one complete copy of the colorized motion picture and the separate description of its contents as specified above, the deposit shall consist of one complete print of the black and white version of the motion picture from which the colorized version was prepared. If special relief from this requirement is requested and granted, the claimant shall make a good faith effort to deposit the best available, near-archival quality black and white print, as a condition of any grant of special relief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Holograms. In the case of any work deposited in the form of a three-dimensional hologram, the copy or copies shall be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Precise instructions for displaying the image fixed in the hologram; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Photographs or other identifying material complying with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations and clearly showing the displayed image.
The number of sets of instructions and identifying material shall be the same as the number of copies required. In the case of a work in the form of a two-dimensional hologram, the image of which is visible without the use of a machine or device, one actual copy of the work shall be deposited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain pictorial and graphic works. In the case of any unpublished pictorial or graphic work, deposit of identifying material in compliance with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations may be made and will suffice in lieu of deposit of an actual copy. In the case of a published pictorial or graphic work, deposit of one complete copy, or of identifying material in compliance with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations, may be made and will suffice in lieu of deposit of two actual copies where an individual author is the owner of copyright, and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Less than five copies of the work have been published; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The work has been published and sold or offered for sale in a limited edition consisting of no more than 300 numbered copies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Commercial prints and labels. In the case of prints, labels, and other advertising matter, including catalogs, published in connection with the rental, lease, lending, licensing, or sale of articles of merchandise, works of authorship, or services, the deposit of one complete copy will suffice in lieu of two copies. Where the print or label is published in a larger work, such as a newspaper or other periodical, one copy of the entire page or pages upon which it appears may be submitted in lieu of the entire larger work. In the case of prints or labels physically inseparable from a three-dimensional object, identifying material complying with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations must be submitted rather than an actual copy or copies except under the conditions of paragraph (c)(2)(xi)(B)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tests. In the case of tests, and answer material for tests, published separately from other literary works, the deposit of one complete copy will suffice in lieu of two copies. In the case of any secure test the Copyright Office will return the deposit to the applicant promptly after examination: Provided, That sufficient portions, description,

or the like are retained so as to constitute a sufficient archival record of the deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Computer programs and databases embodied in machine-readable copies other than CD-ROM format. In cases where a computer program, database, compilation, statistical compendium, or the like, if unpublished is fixed, or if published is published only in the form of machine-readable copies (such as magnetic tape or disks, punched cards, semiconductor chip products, or the like) other than a CD-ROM format, from which the work cannot ordinarily be perceived except with the aid of a machine or device, the deposit shall consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For published or unpublished computer programs, one copy of identifying portions of the program, reproduced in a form visually perceptible without the aid of a machine or device, either on paper or in microform. For these purposes ``identifying portions'' shall mean one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of the source code if reproduced on paper, or at least the first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of the source code if reproduced in microform, together with the page or equivalent unit containing the copyright notice, if any. If the program is 50 pages or less, the required deposit will be the entire source code. In the case of revised versions of computer programs, if the revisions occur throughout the entire program, the deposit of the page containing the copyright notice and the first and last 25 pages of source code will suffice; if the revisions do not occur in the first and last 25 pages, the deposit should consist of the page containing the copyright notice and any 50 pages of source code representative of the revised material; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the program contains trade secret material, the page or equivalent unit containing the copyright notice, if any, plus one of the following: the first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of source code with portions of the source code containing trade secrets blocked-out, provided that the blocked-out portions are proportionately less than the material remaining, and the deposit reveals an appreciable amount of original computer code; or the first and last 10 pages or equivalent units of source code alone with no blocked-out portions; or the first and last 25 pages of object code, together with any 10 or more consecutive pages of source code with no blocked-out portions; or for programs consisting of, or less than, 50 pages or equivalent units, entire source code with the trade secret portions blocked-out, provided that the blocked-out portions are proportionately less than the material remaining, and the remaining portion reveals an appreciable amount of original computer code. If the copyright claim is in a revision not contained in the first and last 25 pages, the deposit shall consist of either 20 pages of source code representative of the revised material with no blocked-out portions, or any 50 pages of source code representative of the revised material with portions of the source code containing trade secrets blocked-out, provided that the blocked-out portions are proportinately less than the material remaining and the deposit reveals an appreciable amount of original computer code. Whatever method is used to block out trade secret material, at least an appreciable amount of original computer code must remain visible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where registration of a program containing trade secrets is made on the basis of an object code deposit the Copyright Office will make registration under its rule of doubt and warn that no determination has been made concerning the existence of copyrightable authorship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Where the application to claim copyright in a computer program includes a specific claim in related computer screen displays, the deposit, in addition to the identifying portions specified in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(A) of this section, shall consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Visual reproductions of the copyrightable expression in the form of printouts, photographs, or drawings no smaller than 3 x 3 inches and no larger than 9 x 12 inches; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the authorship in the work is predominantly audiovisual, a one-half inch VHS format videotape reproducing the copyrightable expression, except that printouts, photographs, or drawings no smaller than 3 x 3 inches and no larger than 9 x 12 inches must

be deposited in lieu of videotape where the computer screen material simply constitutes a demonstration of the functioning of the computer program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For published and unpublished automated databases, compilations, statistical compendia, and the like, so fixed or published, one copy of identifying portions of the work, reproduced in a form visually perceptible without the aid of a machine or device, either on paper or in microform. For these purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identifying portions shall generally mean either the first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of the work if reproduced on paper or in microform.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Datafile and file shall mean a group of data records pertaining to a common subject matter regardless of their size or the number of data items in them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of individual registration of a revised version of the works identified in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(D) of this section, the identifying portions deposited shall contain 50 representative pages or data records which have been added or modified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the work is an automated database comprising multiple separate or distinct data files, ``identifying portions'' shall instead consist of 50 complete data records from each data file or the entire data file, whichever is less, and the descriptive statement required by paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(D)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In the case of group registration for revised or updated versions of a database, the claimant shall deposit identifying portions that contain 50 representative pages or equivalent units, or representative data records which have been marked to disclose (or do in fact disclose solely) the new material added on one representative publication date if published, or on one representative creation date, if unpublished or in the case of applications for automated databases that predominantly consist of photographs, the claimant shall deposit identifying portions that comply with (D)(8) of this section; the claimant shall, also deposit a brief typed or printed descriptive statement containing the notice of copyright information required under paragraphs (c)(2)(vii)(D)(6) or (7) of this section, if the work bears a notice, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The title of the database;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A subtitle, date of creation or publication, or other information, to distinguish any separate or distinct data files for cataloging purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of the copyright claimant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each separate file, its name and content, including its subject, the origin(s) of the data, and the approximate number of data records it contains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of revised or updated versions of an automated database, information as to the nature and frequency of changes in the database and some identification of the location within the database or the separate data files of the revisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For a copyright notice embodied in machine-readable form, the statement shall describe exactly the visually perceptible content of the notice which appears in or with the database, and the manner and frequency with which it is displayed (e.g., at user's terminal only at sign-on, or continuously on terminal display, or on printouts, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If a visually perceptible copyright notice is placed on any copies of the work (or on magnetic tape reels or containers therefor), a sample of such notice must also accompany the statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In the case of an application for registration of a database that consists predominantly of photographs (including a group registration for revised or updated versions of such a database), ``identifying portions'' shall instead consist of all individual photographs included in the claim either in one of the formats set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(xx) of this section or in an electronic format submitted along with the electronic application after consultation and with the permission and under the direction of the Visual Arts Division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Machine-readable copies of works other than computer programs, databases, and works fixed in a CD-ROM format. Where a literary, musical, pictorial, graphic, or audiovisual work, or a sound recording, except for works fixed in a CD-ROM format and literary

works which are computer programs, databases, compilations, statistical compendia or the like, if unpublished has been fixed or, if published, has been published only in machine-readable form, the deposit must consist of identifying material. The type of identifying material submitted should generally be appropriate to the type of work embodied in machine-readable form, but in all cases should be that which best represents the copyrightable content of the work. In all cases the identifying material must include the title of the work. A synopsis may also be requested in addition to the other deposit materials as appropriate in the discretion of the Copyright Office. In the case of any published work subject to this section, the identifying material must include a representation of the copyright notice, if one exists. Identifying material requirements for certain types of works are specified below. In the case of the types of works listed below, the requirements specified shall apply except that, in any case where the specific requirements are not appropriate for a given work the form of the identifying material required will be determined by the Copyright Office in consultation with the applicant, but the Copyright Office will make the final determination of the acceptability of the identifying material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For pictorial or graphic works, the deposit shall consist of identifying material in compliance with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For audiovisual works, the deposit shall consist of either a videotape of the work depicting representative portions of the copyrightable content, or a series of photographs or drawings, depicting representative portions of the work, plus in all cases a separate synopsis of the work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For musical compositions, the deposit shall consist of a transcription of the entire work such as a score, or a reproduction of the entire work on an audiocassette or other phonorecord;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For sound recordings, the deposit shall consist of a reproduction of the entire work on an audiocassette or other phonorecord;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For literary works, the deposit shall consist of a transcription of representative portions of the work including the first and last 25 pages or equivalent units, and five or more pages indicative of the remainder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Copies containing both visually-perceptible and machine-readable material other than a CD-ROM format.

In the case of any unpublished work that is fixed, or any published work that is published, only in the form of a two-dimensional reproduction on sheetlike materials such as textiles and other fabrics, wallpaper and similar commercial wall coverings, carpeting, floor tile, and similar commercial floor coverings, and wrapping paper and similar packaging material, the deposit shall consist of one copy in the form of an actual swatch or piece of such material sufficient to show all elements of the work in which copyright is claimed and the copyright notice appearing on the work, if any. If the work consists of a repeated pictorial or graphic design, the complete design and at least part of one repetition must be shown. If the sheetlike material in or on which a published work has been reproduced has been embodied in or attached to a three-dimensional object, such as furniture, or any other three-dimensional manufactured article, and the work has been published only in that form, the deposit must consist of identifying material complying with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations instead of a copy. If the sheet-like material in or on which a published work has been reproduced has been embodied in or attached to a two-dimensional object such as wearing apparel, bed linen, or a similar item, and the work has been published only in that form, the deposit must consist of identifying material complying with Sec.  202.21 of these regulations instead of a copy unless the copy can be folded for storage in a form that does not exceed four inches in thickness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Works reproduced in or on three-dimensional objects. (A) In the following cases the deposit must consist of identifying material complying with Sec.  201.21 of these regulations instead of a copy or copies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any three-dimensional sculptural work, including any illustration or formulation of artistic expression or information in three-dimensional form.
