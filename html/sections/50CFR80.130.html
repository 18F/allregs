In these cases,  the State or one of its administrative units may hold the title to  grant-funded real property as long as the agency has the authority to  manage the real property for its authorized purpose under the grant. The  agency, the State, or another administrative unit of State government  must not hold title to an undivided ownership interest in the real  property concurrently with a subgrantee or any other entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An ownership interest is an interest in real property that gives  the person who holds it the right to use and occupy a parcel of land or  water and to exclude others. Ownership interests include fee and  leasehold interests but not easements.</p>
