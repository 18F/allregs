                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. This section provides rules for taking  into account items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of members from  intercompany transactions. The purpose of this section is to provide  rules to clearly reflect the taxable income (and tax liability) of the  group as a whole by preventing intercompany transactions from creating,  accelerating, avoiding, or deferring consolidated taxable income (or  consolidated tax liability).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate entity and single entity treatment. Under this section,  the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) are treated as separate  entities for some purposes but as divisions of a single corporation for  other purposes. The amount and location of S's intercompany items and  B's corresponding items are determined on a separate entity basis  (separate entity treatment). For example, S determines its gain or loss  from a sale of property to B on a separate entity basis, and B has a  cost basis in the property. The timing, and the character, source, and  other attributes of the intercompany items and corresponding items,  although initially determined on a separate entity basis, are  redetermined under this section to produce the effect of transactions  between divisions of a single corporation (single entity treatment). For  example, if S sells land to B at a gain and B sells the land to a  nonmember, S does not take its gain into account until B's sale to the  nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing rules as a method of accounting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The  timing rules of this section are a method of accounting for intercompany  transactions, to be applied by each member in addition to the member's  other methods of accounting. See Sec. 1.1502-17 and, with regard to  consolidated return years beginning on or after November 7, 2001,  Sec. 1.446-1(c)(2)(iii). To the extent the timing rules of this section  are inconsistent with a member's otherwise applicable methods of  accounting, the timing rules of this section control. For example, if S  sells property to B in exchange for B's note, the timing rules of this  section apply instead of the installment sale rules of section 453. S's  or B's application of the timing rules of this section to an  intercompany transaction clearly reflects income only if the effect of  that transaction as a whole (including, for example, related costs and  expenses) on consolidated taxable income is clearly reflected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic consent for joining and departing members--(A)  Consent granted. Section 446(e) consent is granted under this section to  the extent a change in method of accounting is necessary solely by  reason of the timing rules of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each member, with respect to its intercompany transactions,  in the first consolidated return year which follows a separate return  year and in which the member engages in an intercompany transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each former member, with respect to its transactions with  members that would otherwise be intercompany transactions if the former  member were still a member, in the first separate return year in which  the former member engages in such a transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cut-off basis. Any change in method of accounting described in  paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is to be effected on a cut-off  basis for transactions entered into on or after the first day of the  year for which consent is granted under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of other rules of law. See Sec. 1.1502-80(a)  regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a  limitation on duplicative adjustments. The rules of this section apply  in addition to other applicable law (including nonstatutory  authorities). For example, this section applies in addition to sections  267(f) (additional rules for certain losses), 269 (acquisitions to evade  or avoid income tax), and 482 (allocations among commonly controlled  taxpayers). Thus, an item taken into account under this section can be  deferred, disallowed, or eliminated under other applicable law, for  example, section 1091 (losses from wash sales).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> References. References in other sections to this section  include, as appropriate, references to prior law. For effective dates  and prior law see paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The principal rules of this section  that implement single entity treatment are the matching rule and the  acceleration rule of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Under the  matching rule, S and B are generally treated as divisions of a single  corporation for purposes of taking into account their items from  intercompany transactions. The acceleration rule provides additional  rules for taking the items into account if the effect of treating S and  B as divisions cannot be achieved (for example, if S or B becomes a  nonmember). Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions.  Paragraph (e) of this section provides simplifying rules for certain  transactions. Paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section provide additional  rules for stock and obligations of members. Paragraphs (h) and (j) of  this section provide anti-avoidance rules and miscellaneous operating  rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Table of examples.

For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intercompany transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An intercompany  transaction is a transaction between corporations that are members of  the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction. S is the  member transferring property or providing services, and B is the member  receiving the property or services. Intercompany transactions include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> S's sale of property (or other transfer, such as an exchange or  contribution) to B, whether or not gain or loss is recognized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> S's performance of services for B, and B's payment or accrual of  its expenditure for S's performance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> S's licensing of technology, rental of property, or loan of  money to B, and B's payment or accrual of its expenditure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> S's distribution to B with respect to S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time of transaction. If a transaction occurs in part while S  and B are members and in part while they are not members, the  transaction is treated as occurring when performance by either S or B  takes place, or when payment for performance would be taken into account  under the rules of this section if it were an intercompany transaction,  whichever is earliest. Appropriate adjustments must be made in such  cases by, for example, dividing the transaction into two separate  transactions reflecting the extent to which S or B has performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Separate transactions. Except as otherwise provided in this  section, each transaction is analyzed separately. For example, if S  simultaneously sells two properties to B, one at a gain and the other at  a loss, each property is treated as sold in a separate transaction.  Thus, the gain and loss cannot be offset or netted against each other  for purposes of this section. Similarly, each payment or accrual of  interest on a loan is a separate transaction. In addition, an accrual of  premium is treated as a separate transaction, or as an offset to  interest that is not a separate transaction, to the extent required  under separate entity treatment. If two members exchange property, each  member is S with respect to the property it transfers and B with respect  to the property it receives. If two members enter into a notional  principal contract, each payment under the contract is a separate  transaction and the member making the payment is B with respect to that  payment and the member receiving the payment is S. See paragraph (j)(4)  of this section for rules aggregating certain transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intercompany items--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. S's income, gain, deduction,  and loss from an intercompany transaction are its intercompany items.  For example, S's gain from the sale of property to B is intercompany  gain. An item is an intercompany item whether it is directly or  indirectly from an intercompany transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Related costs or expenses. S's costs or expenses related to an  intercompany transaction are included in determining its intercompany  items. For example, if S sells inventory to B, S's direct and indirect  costs properly includible under section 263A are included in determining  its intercompany income. Similarly, related costs or expenses that are  not capitalized under S's separate entity method of accounting are  included in determining its intercompany items. For example, deductions  for employee wages, in addition to other related costs, are included in  determining S's intercompany items from performing services for B, and  depreciation deductions are included in determining S's intercompany  items from renting property to B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts not yet recognized or incurred. S's intercompany items  include amounts from an intercompany transaction that are not yet taken  into account under its separate entity method of accounting. For  example, if S is a cash method taxpayer, S's intercompany income might  be taken into account under this section even if the cash is not yet  received. Similarly, an amount reflected in basis (or an amount  equivalent to basis) under S's separate entity method of accounting that  is a substitute for income, gain, deduction or loss from an intercompany  transaction is an intercompany item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corresponding items--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. B's income, gain,  deduction, and loss from an intercompany transaction, or from property  acquired in an intercompany transaction, are its corresponding items.  For example, if B pays rent to S, B's deduction for the rent is a  corresponding deduction. If B buys property from S and sells it to a  nonmember, B's gain or loss from the sale to the nonmember is a  corresponding gain or loss; alternatively, if B recovers the cost of the  property through depreciation, B's depreciation deductions are  corresponding deductions. An item is a corresponding item whether it is  directly or indirectly from an intercompany transaction (or from  property acquired in an intercompany transaction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disallowed or eliminated amounts. B's corresponding items  include amounts that are permanently disallowed or permanently  eliminated, whether directly or indirectly. Thus, corresponding items  include amounts disallowed under section 265 (expenses relating to tax- exempt income), and amounts not recognized under section 311(a)  (nonrecognition of loss on distributions), section 332 (nonrecognition  on liquidating distributions), or section 355(c) (certain distributions  of stock of a subsidiary). On the other hand, an amount is not  permanently disallowed or permanently eliminated (and therefore is not a  corresponding item) to the extent it is not recognized in a transaction  in which B receives a successor asset within the meaning of paragraph  (j)(1) of this section. For example, B's corresponding items do not  include amounts not recognized from a transaction with a nonmember to  which section 1031 applies or from another transaction in which B  receives exchanged basis property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recomputed corresponding items. The recomputed corresponding  item is the corresponding item that B would take into account if S and B  were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany transaction  were between those divisions. For example, if S sells property with a  $70 basis to B for $100, and B later sells the property to a nonmember  for $90, B's corresponding item is its $10 loss, and the recomputed  corresponding item is $20 of gain (determined by comparing the $90 sales  price with the $70 basis the property would have if S and B were  divisions of a single corporation). Although neither S nor B actually  takes the recomputed corresponding item into account, it is computed as  if B did take it into account (based on reasonable and consistently  applied assumptions, including any provision of the Internal Revenue  Code or regulations that would affect its timing or attributes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment as a separate entity. Treatment as a separate entity  means treatment without application of the rules of this section, but  with the application of the other consolidated return regulations. For  example, if S sells the stock of another member to B, S's gain or loss  on a separate entity   basis is determined with the application of Sec. 1.1502-80(b) (non- applicability of section 304), but without redetermination under  paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Attributes. The attributes of an intercompany item or  corresponding item are all of the item's characteristics, except amount,  location, and timing, necessary to determine the item's effect on  taxable income (and tax liability). For example, attributes include  character, source, treatment as excluded from gross income or as a  noncapital, nondeductible amount, and treatment as built-in gain or loss  under section 382(h) or 384. In contrast, the characteristics of  property, such as a member's holding period, or the fact that property  is included in inventory, are not attributes of an item, but these  characteristics might affect the determination of the attributes of  items from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Matching rule. For each consolidated return year, B's  corresponding items and S's intercompany items are taken into account  under the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attributes and holding periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Attributes. The separate  entity attributes of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items  are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on  consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and  B were divisions of a single corporation, and the intercompany  transaction were a transaction between divisions. Thus, the activities  of both S and B might affect the attributes of both intercompany items  and corresponding items. For example, if S holds property for sale to  unrelated customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, S  sells the property to B at a gain and B sells the property to an  unrelated person at a further gain, S's intercompany gain and B's  corresponding gain might be ordinary because of S's activities with  respect to the property. Similar principles apply if S performs  services, rents property, or engages in any other intercompany  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Holding periods. The holding period of property transferred in  an intercompany transaction is the aggregate of the holding periods of S  and B. However, if the basis of the property is determined by reference  to the basis of other property, the property's holding period is  determined by reference to the holding period of the other property. For  example, if S distributes stock to B in a transaction to which section  355 applies, B's holding period in the distributed stock is determined  by reference to B's holding period in the stock of S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B's items. B takes its corresponding items into  account under its accounting method, but the redetermination of the  attributes of a corresponding item might affect its timing. For example,  if B's sale of property acquired from S is treated as a dealer  disposition because of S's activities, section 453(b) prevents any  corresponding income of B from being taken into account under the  installment method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S's items. S takes its intercompany item into account to  reflect the difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken  into account and the recomputed corresponding item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Divisions of a single corporation. As divisions of a single  corporation, S and B are treated as engaging in their actual transaction  and owning any actual property involved in the transaction (rather than  treating the transaction as not occurring). For example, S's sale of  land held for investment to B for cash is not disregarded, but is  treated as an exchange of land for cash between divisions (and B  therefore succeeds to S's basis in the property). Similarly, S's  issuance of its own stock to B in exchange for property is not  disregarded, B is treated as owning the stock it receives in the  exchange, and section 1032 does not apply to B on its subsequent sale of  the S stock. Although treated as divisions, S and B nevertheless are  treated as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operating separate trades or businesses. See, e.g., Sec. 1.446- 1(d) (accounting methods for a taxpayer engaged in more than one  business).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Having any special status that they have under the Internal  Revenue Code or regulations. For example, a bank defined in section 581,  a domestic building and loan association defined in section 7701(a)(19),  and an insurance   company to which section 801 or 831 applies are treated as divisions  having separate special status. On the other hand, the fact that a  member holds property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of  its trade or business is not a special status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>  provides special rules for redetermining and allocating attributes under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offsetting amounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. To the extent B's  corresponding item offsets S's intercompany item in amount, the  attributes of B's corresponding item, determined based on both S's and  B's activities, control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany  item. For example, if S sells depreciable property to B at a gain and B  depreciates the property, the attributes of B's depreciation deduction  (ordinary deduction) control the attributes of S's offsetting  intercompany gain. Accordingly, S's gain is ordinary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> B controls unreasonable. To the extent the results under  paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) are inconsistent with treating S and B as  divisions of a single corporation, the attributes of the offsetting  items must be redetermined in a manner consistent with treating S and B  as divisions of a single corporation. To the extent, however, that B's  corresponding item on a separate entity basis is excluded from gross  income, is a noncapital, nondeductible amount, or is otherwise  permanently disallowed or eliminated, the attributes of B's  corresponding item always control the attributes of S's offsetting  intercompany item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation. To the extent S's intercompany item and B's  corresponding item do not offset in amount, the attributes redetermined  under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must be allocated to S's  intercompany item and B's corresponding item by using a method that is  reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances, including the  purposes of this section and any other rule affected by the attributes  of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. A method of  allocation or redetermination is unreasonable if it is not used  consistently by all members of the group from year to year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special status. Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section, to the extent an item's attributes determined  under this section are permitted or not permitted to a member under the  Internal Revenue Code or regulations by reason of the member's special  status, the attributes required under the Internal Revenue Code or  regulations apply to that member's items (but not the other member). For  example, if S is a bank to which section 582(c) applies, and sells debt  securities at a gain to B, a nonbank, the character of S's intercompany  gain is ordinary as required under section 582(c), but the character of  B's corresponding item as capital or ordinary is determined under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section without the application of section  582(c). For other special status issues, see, for example, sections  595(b) (foreclosure on property securing loans), 818(b) (life insurance  company treatment of capital gains and losses), and 1503(c) (limitation  on absorption of certain losses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are  excluded or nondeductible--(i) In general. Under paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this section, S's intercompany item might be redetermined to be excluded  from gross income or treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. For  example, S's intercompany loss from the sale of property to B is treated  as a noncapital, nondeductible amount if B distributes the property to a  nonmember shareholder at no further gain or loss (because, if S and B  were divisions of a single corporation, the loss would not have been  recognized under section 311(a)). Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section,  however, provides limitations on the application of this rule to  intercompany income or gain. See also Secs. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33  (adjustments to S's stock basis and earnings and profits to reflect  amounts so treated).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on treatment of intercompany items as excluded from  gross income. Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of  this section, S's   intercompany income or gain is redetermined to be excluded from gross  income only to the extent one of the following applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Disallowed amounts. B's corresponding item is a deduction or  loss and, in the taxable year the item is taken into account under this  section, it is permanently and explicitly disallowed under another  provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations. For example,  deductions that are disallowed under section 265 are permanently and  explicitly disallowed.

The matching rule of this paragraph (c) is  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. S  has held the land for more than one year. On January 1 of Year 1, S  sells the land to B for $100. B also holds the land for investment. On  July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> and (3) of this  section, S's $30 gain from the sale to B is its intercompany item, and  B's $10 gain from the sale to X is its corresponding item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)(i)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Timing. For each consolidated return year, S takes its  intercompany item into account under the matching rule to reflect the  difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken into  account and the recomputed corresponding item. If S and B were divisions  of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer  between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and  would have a $40 gain from the sale to X in Year 3, instead of a $10  gain. Consequently, S takes no gain into account in Years 1 and 2, and  takes the entire $30 gain into account in Year 3, to reflect the $30  difference in that year between the $10 gain B takes into account and  the $40 recomputed gain (the recomputed corresponding item). Under  Secs. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33, P's basis in its S stock and the earnings  and profits of S and P do not reflect S's $30 gain until the gain is  taken into account in Year 3. (Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  the results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an installment  sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S must take its  intercompany gain into account under this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Intercompany loss followed by sale to a nonmember at a gain. The  facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that  S's basis in the land is $130 (rather than $70). The attributes and  timing of S's intercompany loss and B's corresponding gain are  determined under the matching rule in the manner provided in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of this Example 1. If S and B were divisions of a single  corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the  divisions, B would succeed to S's $130 basis in the land and would have  a $20 loss from the sale to X instead of a $10 gain. Thus, S takes its  entire $30 loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference  between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $20 recomputed loss.  (The results are the same under section 267(f).) S's $30 loss is long- term capital loss, and B's $10 gain is long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Intercompany gain followed by sale to a nonmember at a loss. The  facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that B  sells the land to X for $90 (rather than $110). The attributes and  timing of S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding loss are  determined under the matching rule. If S and B were divisions of a  single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the  divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and would have a  $20 gain from the sale to X instead of a $10 loss. Thus, S takes its  entire $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference  between B's $10 loss taken into account and the $20 recomputed gain. S's  $30 gain is long-   term capital gain, and B's $10 loss is long-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Intercompany gain followed by distribution to a nonmember at a  loss. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1,  except that B distributes the land to X, a minority shareholder of B,  and at the time of the distribution the land has a fair market value of  $90. The attributes and timing of S's intercompany gain and B's  corresponding loss are determined under the matching rule. Under section  311(a), B does not recognize its $10 loss on the distribution to X. If S  and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale  were a transfer between divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in  the land and would have a $20 gain from the distribution to X instead of  an unrecognized $10 loss. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section,  B's loss that is not recognized under section 311(a) is a corresponding  item. Thus, S takes its $30 gain into account under the matching rule in  Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10 corresponding  unrecognized loss and the $20 recomputed gain. B's $10 corresponding  loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i)  of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control the  attributes of S's intercompany item. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section  does not prevent the redetermination of S's intercompany item as  excluded from gross income. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this  section). Thus, $10 of S's $30 gain is redetermined to be excluded from  gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Intercompany sale followed by section 1031 exchange with  nonmember. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1,  except that, instead of selling the land to X, B exchanges the land for  land owned by X in a transaction to which section 1031 applies. There is  no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken into  account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's  intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a  result of the section 1031 exchange. Instead, B's gain is preserved in  the land received from X and, under the successor asset rule of  paragraph (j)(1) of this section, S's intercompany gain is taken into  account by reference to the replacement property. (If B takes gain into  account as a result of boot received in the exchange, S's intercompany  gain is taken into account under the matching rule to the extent the  boot causes a difference between B's gain taken into account and the  recomputed gain.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to nonmember.  The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except  that, instead of selling the land to X, B transfers the land to X in a  transaction to which section 351(a) applies and X remains a nonmember.  There is no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken  into account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's  intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a  result of the section 351(a) transfer. However, S's entire gain is taken  into account in Year 3 under the acceleration rule of paragraph (d) of  this section (because X, a nonmember, reflects B's $100 cost basis in  the land under section 362).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S holds land for investment  with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for  $100. B develops the land as residential real estate, and sells  developed lots to customers during Year 3 for an aggregate amount of  $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Attributes. S and B are treated under the matching rule as  divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the  attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. Thus,  although S held the land for investment, whether the gain is treated as  from the sale of property described in section 1221(1) is based on the  activities of both S and B. If, based on both S's and B's activities,  the land is described in section 1221(1), both S's gain and B's gain are  ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>,  and its basis in the B stock is $70 under section 358. Under section  362, B's basis in the land is $70. B holds the land for investment. On  July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $100. Assume that if S and B  were divisions of a single corporation, B's gain from the sale would be  ordinary income because of S's activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section,  S's transfer to B is an intercompany transaction. Under paragraph (c)(3)  of this section, S is treated as transferring the land in exchange for  B's stock even though, as divisions, S could not own stock of B. S has  no intercompany item, but B's $30 gain from its sale of the land to X is  a corresponding item because the land was acquired in an intercompany  transaction. B's $30 gain is ordinary income that is taken into account  under B's method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Intercompany section 351 transfer with boot. The facts are the  same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S receives $10  cash in addition to the B stock in the transfer. S recognizes $10 of  gain under section 351(b), and its basis in the B stock is $70 under  section 358. Under section 362, B's basis in the land is $80. S takes  its $10 intercompany gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $10  difference between B's $20 corresponding gain taken into account and the   $30 recomputed gain. Both S's $10 gain and B's $20 gain are ordinary  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Partial disposition. The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)  of this Example 3, except B sells only a one- half, undivided interest  in the land to X for $50. The timing and attributes are determined in  the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this Example 3, except that S  takes only $5 of its gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $5  difference between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $15  recomputed gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. On January 1 of Year 1,  S buys 10-year recovery property for $100 and depreciates it under the  straight-line method. On January 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B  for $130. Under section 168(i)(7), B is treated as S for purposes of  section 168 to the extent B's $130 basis does not exceed S's adjusted  basis at the time of the sale. B's additional basis is treated as new  10-year recovery property for which B elects the straight-line method of  recovery. (To simplify the example, the half-year convention is  disregarded.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Depreciation through Year 3; intercompany gain. S claims $10 of  depreciation for each of Years 1 and 2 and has an $80 basis at the time  of the sale to B. Thus, S has a $50 intercompany gain from its sale to  B. For Year 3, B has $10 of depreciation with respect to $80 of its  basis (the portion of its $130 basis not exceeding S's adjusted basis).  In addition, B has $5 of depreciation with respect to the $50 of its  additional basis that exceeds S's adjusted basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing. S's $50 gain is taken into account to reflect the  difference for each consolidated return year between B's depreciation  taken into account with respect to the property and the recomputed  depreciation. For Year 3, B takes $15 of depreciation into account. If  the intercompany transaction were a transfer between divisions of a  single corporation, B would succeed to S's adjusted basis in the  property and take into account only $10 of depreciation for Year 3.  Thus, S takes $5 of gain into account in Year 3. In each subsequent year  that B takes into account $15 of depreciation with respect to the  property, S takes into account $5 of gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Attributes. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the  attributes of S's gain and B's depreciation must be redetermined to the  extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable  income as if the intercompany transaction were between divisions of a  single corporation (the group must have a net depreciation deduction of  $10). In each year, $5 of B's corresponding depreciation deduction  offsets S's $5 intercompany gain taken into account and, under paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item  control the attributes of S's intercompany item. Accordingly, S's  intercompany gain that is taken into account as a result of B's  depreciation deduction is ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sale of property to a nonmember. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that B sells the property to X  on January 1 of Year 5 for $110. As set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d)  of this Example 4, B has $15 of depreciation with respect to the  property in each of Years 3 and 4, causing S to take $5 of intercompany  gain into account in each year as ordinary income. The $40 balance of  S's intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 5 as a result of B's  sale to X, to reflect the $40 difference between B's $10 gain taken into  account and the $50 of recomputed gain ($110 of sale proceeds minus the  $60 basis B would have if the intercompany sale were a transfer between  divisions of a single corporation). Treating S and B as divisions of a  single corporation, $40 of the gain is section 1245 gain and $10 is  section 1231 gain. On a separate entity basis, S would have more than  $10 treated as section 1231 gain, and B would have no amount treated as  section 1231 gain. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, all $10  of the section 1231 gain is allocated to S. S's remaining $30 of gain,  and all of B's $10 gain, is treated as section 1245 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70x. On January 1 of  Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100x. B also holds the land for  investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X in exchange for  X's $110x note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of  the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55x  in Year 4 and $55x in Year 5. The interest charge under section 453A(c)  applies to X's note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing and attributes. S takes its $30x gain into account to  reflect the difference in each consolidated return year between B's gain  taken into account for the year and the recomputed gain. Under section  453, B takes into account $5x of gain in Year 4 and $5x of gain in Year  5. Thus, S takes into account $15x of gain in Year 4 and $15x of gain in  Year 5 to reflect the $15x difference in each of those years between B's  $5x gain taken into account and the $20x recomputed gain. Both S's $30x  gain and B's $10x gain are subject to the section 453A(c) interest  charge beginning in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election out under section 453(d). If, under the facts in  paragraph (a) of this Example 5, the P group wishes to elect not to  apply section 453 with respect to S's gain, an election under section  453(d) must be made for Year 3 with respect to B's gain. This election  will cause B's $10x gain to be taken into account in Year 3. Under the  matching rule, this will result in S's $30x gain being taken into  account in Year 3. (An election by the P group solely with respect to  S's gain has no effect because the gain from S's sale to B is   taken into account under the matching rule, and therefore must reflect  the difference between B's gain taken into account and the recomputed  gain.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> for Year 3 not to apply section 453  with respect to the gain, all of S's $30x gain will be taken into  account in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x loss taken  into account and the $20x recomputed gain.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Intercompany loss, installment gain. The facts are the same as  in paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that S has a $130x (rather  than $70x) basis in the land. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,  the separate entity attributes of S's and B's items from the  intercompany transaction must be redetermined to produce the same effect  on consolidated taxable income (and tax liability) as if the transaction  had been a transfer between divisions. If S and B were divisions of a  single corporation, B would succeed to S's basis in the land and the  group would have $20x loss from the sale to X, installment reporting  would be unavailable, and the interest charge under section 453A(c)  would not apply. Accordingly, B's gain from the transaction is not  eligible for installment treatment under section 453. B takes its $10x  gain into account in Year 3, and S takes its $30x of loss into account  in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x gain and the $20x  recomputed loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recapture income. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 5, except that S bought depreciable property (rather than  land) for $100x, claimed depreciation deductions, and reduced the  property's basis to $70x before Year 1. (To simplify the example, B's  depreciation is disregarded.) If the intercompany sale of property had  been a transfer between divisions of a single corporation, $30x of the  $40x gain from the sale to X would be section 1245 gain (which is  ineligible for installment reporting) and $10x would be section 1231  gain (which is eligible for installment reporting). On a separate entity  basis, S would have $30x of section 1245 gain and B would have $10x of  section 1231 gain. Accordingly, the attributes are not redetermined  under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. All of B's $10x gain is  eligible for installment reporting and is taken into account $5x each in  Years 4 and 5 (and is subject to the interest charge under section  453A(c)). S's $30x gain is taken into account in Year 3 to reflect the  difference between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $30x of  recomputed gain. (If S had bought the depreciable property for $110x and  its recomputed basis under section 1245 had been $110x (rather than  $100x), B's $10x gain and S's $30x gain would both be recapture income  ineligible for installment reporting.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing and attributes. S's sale of X's note to B is an  intercompany transaction, and S's $30x gain is intercompany gain. S  takes $15x of the gain into account in each of Years 5 and 6 to reflect  the $15x difference in each year between B's $0 gain taken into account  and the $15x recomputed gain. S's gain continues to be treated as its  gain from the sale to X, and the deferred tax liability remains subject  to the interest charge under section 453A(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)(i)</em> of this section, S's gain is long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>, B's $100x of proceeds from the secured indebtedness is  treated as an amount received on December 1 of Year 3 by B on X's note.  Thus, S takes its entire $30x gain into account in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S is a driller of  water wells. B operates a ranch in a remote location, and B's taxable  income from the ranch is not subject to section 447. B's ranch requires  water to maintain its cattle. During Year 1, S drills an artesian well  on B's ranch in exchange for $100 from B, and S incurs $80 of expenses  (e.g., for employees and equipment). B capitalizes its $100 cost for the  well under section 263, and takes into account $10 of cost recovery  deductions in each of Years 2 through 11. Under its separate entity  method of accounting, S would take its income and expenses into account  in Year 1. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the costs  incurred in drilling the well would be capitalized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(ii)</em> of this section, S's  $100 of income and $80 of related expenses are both included in  determining its intercompany income of $20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)(i)</em> of this  section). If S's offsetting $80 of income and expense would not be taken  into account in the same year under its separate entity method of  accounting, they nevertheless must be taken into account under this  section in a manner that clearly reflects consolidated taxable income.  See paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sale of capitalized services. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 7, except that B sells the ranch before  Year 11 and recognizes gain attributable to the well. To the extent of  S's income taken into account as a result of B's cost recovery  deductions, as well as S's offsetting $80 of income and expense, the  timing and attributes are determined in the manner provided in paragraph  (c) of this Example 7. The attributes of the remainder of S's $20 of  income and B's gain from the sale are redetermined to produce the same  effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a  single corporation. Accordingly, S's remaining intercompany income is  treated as recapture income or section 1231 gain, even though it is from  S's performance of services.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Rental of property. B operates a ranch that requires  grazing land for its cattle. S owns undeveloped land adjoining B's  ranch. On January 1 of Year 1, S leases grazing rights to B for Year 1.  B's $100 rent expense is deductible for Year 1 under its separate entity  accounting method. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the rental  transaction is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and  B is the buying member. S takes its $100 of income into account in Year  1 to reflect the $100 difference between B's rental deduction taken into  account and the $0 recomputed rental deduction. S's income and B's  deduction are ordinary items (because S's intercompany item and B's  corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate entity basis,  the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S  owns a 20% interest in the capital and profits of a general partnership.  The partnership holds land for investment with a basis equal to its  value, and operates depreciable assets which have value in excess of  basis. S's basis in its partnership interest equals its share of the  adjusted basis of the partnership's land and depreciable assets. The  partnership has an election under section 754 in effect. On January 1 of  Year 1, S sells its partnership interest to B at a gain. During Years 1  through 10, the partnership depreciates the operating assets, and B's  depreciation deductions from the partnership reflect the increase in the  basis of the depreciable assets under section 743(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> adjustment,  because the adjustment is solely with respect to B and therefore no  nonmember reflects any part of the intercompany transaction.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partnership sale of assets. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 9, and the partnership sells some of its  depreciable assets to X at a gain on December 31 of Year 4. In addition  to the intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the  partnership's depreciation, S takes intercompany gain into account in  Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's partnership items taken  into account from the sale (which reflect the basis increase under  section 743(b)) and the recomputed partnership items. The attributes of  S's additional gain are redetermined to produce the same effect on  consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single  corporation (recapture income or section 1231 gain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> B's sale of partnership interest. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 9, and on December 31 of Year 4, B sells  its partnership interest to X at no gain or loss. In addition to the  intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the partnership's  depreciation, the remaining balance of S's intercompany gain is taken  into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's $0 gain  taken into account from the sale of the partnership interest and the  recomputed gain. The character of S's remaining intercompany item and  B's corresponding item are determined on a separate entity basis under  section 751, and then redetermined to the extent necessary to produce  the same effect as treating the intercompany transaction as occurring  between divisions of a single corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No section 754 election. The facts are the same as in paragraph  (d) of this Example 9, except that the partnership does not have a  section 754 election in effect, and B recognizes a capital loss from its  sale of the partnership interest to X on December 31 of Year 4. Because  there is no difference between B's depreciation deductions from the  partnership taken into account and the recomputed depreciation  deductions, S does not take any of its gain into account during Years 1  through 4 as a result of B's partnership's items. Instead, S's entire  intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 4 to reflect the  difference between B's loss taken into account from the sale to X and  the recomputed gain or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. S has  net operating loss carryovers from prior years. P's acquisition results  in an ownership change under section 382 with respect to S's loss  carryovers, and S has a net unrealized built-in gain (within the meaning  of section 382(h)(3)). S owns nondepreciable property with a $70 basis  and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B for $100,  and its $30 gain is recognized built-in gain (within the meaning of  section 382(h)(2)) on a separate entity basis. On December 1 of Year 5,  B sells the property to X for $90.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing and attributes. S's $30 gain is taken into account in  Year 5 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $10 loss taken into  account and the recomputed $20 gain. S and B are treated as divisions of  a single corporation for purposes of applying section 382 in connection  with the intercompany transaction. Under a single entity analysis, the  single corporation has losses subject to limitation under section 382,  and this limitation may be increased under section 382(h) if the single  corporation has recognized built-in gain with respect to those losses.  B's $10 corresponding loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain, and  thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, $10 of S's intercompany  gain is redetermined not to be recognized built-in gain. S's remaining  $20 intercompany gain continues to be treated as recognized built-in  gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> B's recognized built-in gain. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 10, except that the property declines in  value after S becomes a member of the P group, S sells the property to B  for its $70 basis, and B sells the property to X for $90 during Year 5.  Treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, S's sale to B  does not cause the property to cease to be built-in gain property. Thus,  B's $20 gain from its sale to X is recognized built-in gain that  increases the section 382 limitation applicable to S's losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> SRLY limitation. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 10, except that P's acquisition of S is not subject to the  overlap rule of Sec. 1.1502-21(g), and S's net operating loss carryovers  are subject to the separate return limitation year (SRLY) rules. See  Sec. 1.1502-21(c). The application of the SRLY rules depends on S's  status as a separate corporation having losses from separate return  limitation years. Under paragraph (c)(5), the attribute of S's  intercompany item as it relates to S's SRLY limitation is not  redetermined, because the SRLY limitation depends on S's special status.  Accordingly, S's $30 intercompany gain is included in determining its  SRLY limitation for Year 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S, a dealer in securities within  the meaning of section 475(c), owns a security with a basis of $70. The  security is held for sale to customers and is not identified under  section 475(b) as within an exception to marking to market. On July 1 of  Year 1, S sells the security to B for $100. B is not a dealer and holds  the security for investment. On December 31 of Year 1, the fair market  value of the security is $100. On July 1 of Year 2, B sells the security  to X for $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> only if it timely identifies the security as so described. Under  the matching rule, attributes must be redetermined by treating S and B  as divisions of a single corporation. As a result of S's activities, the  single corporation is treated as a dealer with respect to securities,  and B must continue to mark to market the security acquired from S.  Thus, B's corresponding items and the recomputed corresponding items are  determined by continuing to treat the security as not within an  exception to marking to market. Under section 475(d)(3), it is possible  for the character of S's intercompany items to differ from the character  of B's corresponding items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing and character. S has a $30 gain when it disposes of the  security by selling it to B. This gain is intercompany gain that is  taken into account in Year 1 to reflect the $30 difference between B's  $0 gain taken into account from marking the security to market under  section 475 and the recomputed $30 gain that would be taken into  account. The character of S's gain and B's gain are redetermined as if  the security were transferred between divisions. Accordingly, S's gain  is ordinary income under section 475(d)(3)(A)(i), but under section  475(d)(3)(B)(ii) B's $10 gain from its sale to X is capital gain that is  taken into account in Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)</em> would provide  for $30 of capital gain and $10 of ordinary loss. Because the attributes  are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,  paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section does not apply. Furthermore, if B  held the security for investment, and so identified the security under  section 475(b)(1), the security would continue to be excepted from  marking to market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. On July 1 of Year 1, S enters  into offsetting long and short positions with respect to actively traded  personal property. The positions are not section 1256 contracts, and  they are the only positions taken into account for purposes of applying  section 1092. On August 1 of Year 1, S sells the long position to B at  an $11 loss, and there is $11 of unrealized gain in the offsetting short  position. On December 1 of Year 1, B sells the long position to X at no  gain or loss. On December 31 of Year 1, there is still $11 of unrealized  gain in the short position. On February 1 of Year 2, S closes the short  position at an $11 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing and attributes. If the sale from S to B were a transfer  between divisions of a single corporation, the $11 loss on the sale to X  would have been deferred under section 1092(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, there  is no difference in Year 1 between B's corresponding item of $0 and the  recomputed corresponding item of $0. S takes its $11 loss into account  in Year 2 to reflect the difference between B's corresponding item of $0  taken into account in Year 2 and the recomputed loss of $11 that would  have been taken into account in Year 2 under section 1092(a)(1)(B) if S  and B had been divisions of a single corporation. (The results are the  same under section 267(f)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Intercompany  sale with no independent factory price. S manufactures inventory in the  United States, and recognizes $75 of income on sales to B in Year 1. B  distributes the inventory in Country Y and recognizes $25 of income on  sales to X, also in Year 1. Title passes from S to B, and from B to X,  in Country Y. There is no independent factory price (as defined in  regulations under section 863) for the sale from S to B. Under the  matching rule, S's $75 intercompany income and B's $25 corresponding  income are taken into account in Year 1. In determining the source of  income, S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation, and  section 863 applies as if $100 of income were recognized   from producing in the United States and selling in Country Y. Assume  that applying the section 863 regulations on a single entity basis, $50  is treated as foreign source income and $50 as U.S. source income.  Assume further that on a separate entity basis, S would have $37.50 of  foreign source income and $37.50 of U.S. source income, and that all of  B's $25 of income would be foreign source income. Thus, on a separate  entity basis, S and B would have $62.50 of combined foreign source  income and $37.50 of U.S. source income. Accordingly, under single  entity treatment, $12.50 that would be treated as foreign source income  on a separate entity basis is redetermined to be U.S. source income.  Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, attributes are redetermined  only to the extent of the $12.50 necessary to achieve the same effect as  a single entity determination. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this  section, the redetermined attribute must be allocated between S and B  using a reasonable method. For example, it may be reasonable to  recharacterize only S's foreign source income as U.S. source income  because only S would have any U.S. source income on a separate entity  basis. However, it may also be reasonable to allocate the redetermined  attribute between S and B in proportion to their separate entity amounts  of foreign source income (in a 3:2 ratio, so that $7.50 of S's foreign  source income is redetermined to be U.S. source and $5 of B's foreign  source income is redetermined to be U.S. source), provided the same  method is applied to all similar transactions within the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intercompany sale with independent factory price. The facts are  the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 14, except that an  independent factory price exists for the sale by S to B such that $70 of  S's $75 of income is attributable to the production function. Assume  that on a single entity basis, $70 is treated as U.S. source income  (because of the existence of the independent factory price) and $30 is  treated as foreign source income. Assume that on a separate entity  basis, $70 of S's income would be treated as U.S. source, $5 of S's  income would be treated as foreign source income, and all of B's $25  income would be treated as foreign source income. Because the results  are the same on a single entity basis and a separate entity basis, the  attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(4)(ii)</em> of this section, the redetermined attribute  must be allocated between S and B using a reasonable method. (If instead  of performing services, S licensed an intangible to B and earned $10  that would be treated as U.S. source income on a separate entity basis,  the results would be the same.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, S forms  FT, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, with a $10 contribution. During  Years 1 through 3, FT has earnings and profits of $40. None of the  earnings and profits is taxed as subpart F income under section 951, and  FT distributes no dividends to S during this period. On January 1 of  Year 4, S sells its FT stock to B for $50. While B owns FT, FT has a  deficit in earnings and profits of $10. On July 1 of Year 6, B sells its  FT stock for $70 to X, an unrelated foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing. S's $40 of intercompany gain is taken into account in  Year 6 to reflect the difference between B's $20 of gain taken into  account and the $60 recomputed gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(4)(ii)</em> of this section, this redetermined  attribute must be allocated between S's intercompany item and B's  corresponding item by using a reasonable method. On a separate entity  basis, only S would have any amount treated as a dividend under section  1248 available for redetermination. Accordingly, $10 of S's income is  redetermined to be not subject to section 1248, with the result that $30  of S's intercompany gain is treated as a dividend and the remaining $10  is treated as capital gain. All of B's corresponding gain is treated as  capital gain, as it would be on a separate entity basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> B has loss. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this  Example 15, except that FT has no earnings and profits or deficit in  earnings and profits while B owns FT, and B sells the FT stock to X for  $40. On a single entity basis, there is $30 of gain, and section 1248 is  applied on the basis of FT's $40 earnings and profits at the time of the  sale of FT to X. Under section 1248, the amount treated as a dividend is  limited to $30 (the amount of the gain). On a separate entity basis, S's  entire $40 gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248, and  B's $10 loss would be a capital loss. B's $10 corresponding loss offsets  $10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control. Accordingly,  $10 of S's gain must be redetermined to be capital gain. B's $10 loss  remains a capital loss. (If, however, S sold FT to B at a loss and B  sold FT to X at a gain, it may be unreasonable for the attributes of B's  corresponding gain to control S's offsetting intercompany loss. If B's  attributes were to control, for example, the group could possibly claim  a larger foreign tax credit than would be available if S and B were  divisions of a single corporation.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. P owns all of the stock of S, S owns all the  stock of T, a member of the P group, and T owns all of the stock of T1,  also a member of the P group. On January 1 of Year 1, S distributes all  of the T stock to P in a distribution to which section 301 applies. At  the time of this distribution, the value of the T stock is $100 and S  has a $40 basis in the T stock. Under section 311(b), the distribution  creates $60 of intercompany gain to S. Under section 301(d), P's basis  in the T stock is $100. S will take its $60 intercompany gain into  account under the matching rule. On January 1 of Year 4, in an  independent transaction, S distributes all of its assets to P in a  complete liquidation to which section 332 applies, and, under paragraph  (j)(2) of this section, P succeeds to S's $60 gain. On January 1 of Year  7, T distributes all of its T1 stock to P in a transaction to which  section 355 applies. At the time of this distribution, P has a basis in  the T stock of $100, the value of the T stock (without regard to T1) is  $75, and the value of the T1 stock is $25. Under section 358, P  allocates $25 of its $100 basis in the T stock to the T1 stock, and,  under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the T1 stock becomes a successor  asset to the T stock. On January 1 of Year 9, in an independent  transaction, T distributes all of its assets to P in a complete  liquidation to which section 332 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(ii)</em> of this section, P's $0 gain or loss with respect  to the T stock under section 332 is a corresponding item. P takes $45  (75/100 x $60) of its intercompany gain into account under the matching  rule in Year 9 to reflect the difference between P's $0 of unrecognized  gain and P's $45 of recomputed unrecognized gain. (If P and S were  divisions of a single corporation, P would have had a $40 basis in the T  stock, and, after the Year 7 distribution of the T1 stock, would have  held the T stock with a $30 basis.) However, paragraph (c)(6) of this  section does not prevent the redetermination of P's intercompany gain as  excluded from gross income provided P succeeds to S's intercompany item;  P and S are a single entity; P's basis in the T stock that reflects the  $45 intercompany gain taken into account is eliminated without the  recognition of gain or loss (and this eliminated basis is not further  reflected in the basis of any successor asset); the group has not  derived and no taxpayer will derive any Federal income tax benefit from  the basis in the T stock and will not derive any Federal income tax  benefit from a redetermination of this portion of the gain; and the  effects of the intercompany transaction have not previously been  reflected, directly or indirectly, on the P group's consolidated return.  (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.) Accordingly, under  paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, the $45 intercompany gain that  P takes into account is redetermined to be excluded from gross income.  P's basis in its T1 stock continues to reflect $15 of intercompany gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as Example 16, except  that T does not distribute the stock of T1, instead, in Year 7, T makes  a distribution of $50 to P in a transaction to which section 301  applies. Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in its T stock is reduced by  $50 and, under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the intercompany  distribution is excluded from P's gross income. Further, in Year 9,  instead of liquidating T, P distributes the T stock to its shareholders  in a transaction to which section 355 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(ii)</em> of  this section, P's $0 of unrecognized gain or loss with respect to the T  stock under section 355(c) is a corresponding item. P takes its $60  intercompany gain into account under the matching rule in Year 9 to  reflect the difference between P's $0 of unrecognized gain and P's $60  of recomputed gain ($50 unrecognized gain and $10 recognized gain). (If  P and S were divisions of a single corporation, P would have had a $40  basis in the T stock, and, after the Year 7 distribution, would have  held the T stock with a $10 excess loss account.) See paragraph (f)(7),  Example 2 of this section. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not  prevent the redetermination of P's intercompany gain as excluded from  gross income provided P succeeds to S's intercompany item; P and S are a  single entity; P's basis in the T stock that reflects the $60  intercompany gain taken into account is eliminated without the  recognition of gain or loss (and this eliminated basis is not further  reflected in any successor asset); the group has not derived any Federal  income tax benefit from the basis in the T stock and will not derive any  Federal income tax benefit from a redetermination of this portion of the  gain; and the effects of the intercompany transaction have not  previously been reflected, directly or indirectly, on the P group's  consolidated return. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.) The  intercompany transaction with respect to the T stock resulted in an  increase in the basis of the T stock, and this increase in the basis of  the T stock prevented P from holding the T stock with a $10 excess loss  account (as a result of the Year 7 distribution) at the time of the  section 355 distribution. Accordingly, the group derived a Federal  income tax benefit from the intercompany transaction to the extent of  $10 and, under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, only $50 of the  $60 intercompany gain that P takes into account is redetermined to be  excluded from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)(ii)(C)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.

If the item is from an  intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, its attributes  are determined under the principles of the matching rule as if B sold  the property, at the time the item is taken into account under paragraph   (d)(1)(i) of this section, for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted  basis in the property (i.e., at no net gain or loss), to the following  person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property leaves the group. If the property is owned by a  nonmember immediately after S's item is taken into account, B is treated  as selling the property to that nonmember. If the nonmember is related  for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or  regulations to any party to the intercompany transaction (or any related  transaction) or to the common parent, the nonmember is treated as  related to B for purposes of that provision. For example, if the  nonmember is related to P within the meaning of section 1239(b), the  deemed sale is treated as being described in section 1239(a). See  paragraph (j)(6) of this section, under which property is not treated as  being owned by a nonmember if it is owned by the common parent after the  common parent becomes the only remaining member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property does not leave the group.

The acceleration rule of this paragraph (d) is  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S owns land with  a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100.  On July 1 of Year 3, P sells 60% of S's stock to X for $60 and, as a  result, S becomes a nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Matching rule. Under the matching rule, none of S's $30 gain is  taken into account in Years 1 through 3 because there is no difference  between B's $0 gain or loss taken into account and the recomputed gain  or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acceleration of S's intercompany items. Under the acceleration  rule of paragraph (d) of this section, S's $30 gain is taken into  account in computing consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax  liability) immediately before the effect of treating S and B as  divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced. Because the effect  cannot be produced once S becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into  account in Year 3 immediately before becoming a nonmember. S's gain is  reflected under Sec. 1.1502-32 in P's basis in the S stock immediately  before P's sale of the stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in the S  stock is increased by $30, and therefore P's gain is reduced (or loss is  increased) by $18 (60% of $30). See also Secs. 1.1502-33 and 1.1502- 76(b). (The results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an  installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S  must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> B's corresponding items. Notwithstanding the acceleration of S's  gain, B continues to take its corresponding items into account under its  accounting method. Thus, B's items from the land are taken into account  based on subsequent events (e.g., its sale of the land).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sale of B's stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 1, except that P sells 60% of B's stock (rather than S  stock) to X for $60 and, as a result, B becomes a nonmember. Because the  effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation cannot  be produced once B becomes   a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into account under the acceleration  rule immediately before B becomes a nonmember. (The results would be the  same if S sold the land to B in an installment sale to which section 453  would otherwise apply, because S must take its intercompany gain into  account under this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Discontinue filing consolidated returns. The facts are the same  as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that the P group receives  permission under Sec. 1.1502-75(c) to discontinue filing consolidated  returns beginning in Year 3. Under the acceleration rule, S takes its  $30 gain into account on December 31 of Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> No subgroups. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this  Example 1, except that P simultaneously sells all of the stock of both S  and B to X (rather than 60% of S's stock), and S and B become members of  the X consolidated group. Because the effect of treating S and B as  divisions of a single corporation in the P group cannot be produced once  S and B become nonmembers, S takes its $30 gain into account under the  acceleration rule immediately before S and B become nonmembers.  (Paragraph (j)(5) of this section does not apply to treat the X  consolidated group as succeeding to the P group because the X group  acquired only the stock of S and B.) However, so long as S and B  continue to join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns,  B continues to treat S and B as divisions of a single corporation for  purposes of determining the attributes of B's corresponding items from  the land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S holds land  for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the  land to B for $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the  ordinary course of business, and expends substantial resources over a  two-year period subdividing, developing, and marketing the land. On July  1 of Year 3, before B has sold any of the land, P sells 60% of S's stock  to X for $60 and, as a result, S becomes a nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Attributes. Under the acceleration rule, the attributes of S's  gain are redetermined under the principles of the matching rule as if B  sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the  group for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the land  (because the land continues to be held within the group). Thus, whether  S's gain is capital gain or ordinary income depends on the activities of  both S and B. Because S and B no longer join with each other in the  filing of consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding  items (e.g., from its subsequent sale of the land) are redetermined  under the principles of the matching rule as if the S division (but not  the B division) were transferred by the single corporation to an  unrelated person at the time of P's sale of the S stock. Thus, B  continues to take into account the activities of S with respect to the  land before the intercompany transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Depreciable property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)  of this Example 2, except that the property sold by S to B is  depreciable property. Section 1239 applies to treat all of S's gain as  ordinary income because it is taken into account as a result of B's  deemed sale of the property to an affiliated corporation that is not a  member of the group (a related person within the meaning of section  1239(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  Facts. S owns land with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells  the land to B in exchange for B's $110 note. The note bears a market  rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides  for principal payments of $55 in Year 4 and $55 in Year 5. On July 1 of  Year 3, S sells B's note to X for $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing. S's intercompany gain is taken into account under this  section, and not under the rules of section 453. Consequently, S's sale  of B's note does not result in its intercompany gain from the land being  taken into account (e.g., under section 453B). The sale does not prevent  S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items from being taken into  account in determining the group's consolidated taxable income under the  matching rule, and X does not reflect any aspect of the intercompany  transaction (X has its own cost basis in the note). S will take the  intercompany gain into account under the matching rule or acceleration  rule based on subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land). See also  paragraph (g) of this section for additional rules applicable to B's  note as an intercompany obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Cancellation of debt and attribute reduction under  section 108(b). (a) Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of  $0. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. B also holds  the land for investment. During Year 3, B is insolvent and B's nonmember  creditors discharge $60 of B's indebtedness. Because of insolvency, B's  $60 discharge is excluded from B's gross income under section 108(a),  and B reduces the basis of the land by $60 under sections 108(b) and  1017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceleration rule. As a result of B's basis reduction under  section 1017, $60 of S's intercompany gain will not be taken into  account under the matching rule (because there is only a $40 difference  between B's $40 basis in the land and the $0 basis the land would have  if S and B were divisions of a single corporation). Accordingly, S takes  $60 of its gain into account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. S's  gain is long-term capital gain, determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of  this section as if B sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is  not a member of the   group for $100 immediately before the basis reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Purchase price adjustment. Assume instead that S sells the land  to B in exchange for B's $100 purchase money note, B remains solvent,  and S subsequently agrees to discharge $60 of the note as a purchase  price adjustment to which section 108(e)(5) applies. Under applicable  principles of tax law, $60 of S's gain and $60 of B's basis in the land  are eliminated and never taken into account. Similarly, the note is not  treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  adjustment to Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section,  the balance of S's section 481(a) adjustment accelerated to Year 3 is  intercompany income. However, S's $100 basis increase before the  intercompany transaction eliminates the related difference for this  amount between B's corresponding items taken into account and the  recomputed corresponding items in subsequent periods. Because the  accelerated section 481(a) adjustment will not be taken into account in  determining the group's consolidated taxable income (and consolidated  tax liability) under the matching rule, the balance of S's section 481  adjustment is taken into account under the acceleration rule as ordinary  income at the time of the intercompany transaction. (If S's sale had not  resulted in accelerating S's section 481(a) adjustment on a separate  entity basis, S would have no intercompany income to be taken into  account under this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Simplifying rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dollar-value LIFO inventory methods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. This paragraph (e)(1) applies if either S or B uses a  dollar-value LIFO inventory method to account for intercompany  transactions. Rather than applying the matching rule separately to each  intercompany inventory transaction, this paragraph (e)(1) provides  methods to apply an aggregate approach that is based on dollar-value  LIFO inventory accounting. Any method selected under this paragraph  (e)(1) must be applied consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B uses dollar-value LIFO--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If B uses a dollar- value LIFO inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory  purchases, and includes all of its inventory costs incurred for a year  in its cost of goods sold for the year (that is, B has no inventory  increment for the year), S takes into account all of its intercompany  inventory items for the year. If B does not include all of its inventory  costs incurred for the year in its cost of goods sold for the year (that  is, B has an inventory increment for the year), S does not take all of  its intercompany inventory income or loss into account. The amount not  taken into account is determined under either the increment averaging  method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section or the increment  valuation method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. Separate  computations are made for each pool of B that receives intercompany  purchases from S, and S's amount not taken into account is layered based  on B's LIFO inventory layers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>,  the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany  inventory income or loss multiplied by the ratio of the LIFO value of  B's current-year costs of its layer of increment to B's total inventory  costs incurred for the year under its LIFO inventory method. If B  includes more than its inventory costs incurred during any subsequent  year in its cost of goods sold (a decrement), S takes into account the  intercompany inventory income or loss layers in the same manner and  proportion as B takes into account its inventory decrements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>,  the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany  inventory income or loss for the appropriate period multiplied by the  ratio of the LIFO value of B's current-year costs of its layer of  increment to B's total inventory costs incurred in the appropriate  period under its LIFO inventory method. The principles of paragraph  (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section otherwise apply. The appropriate period is  the period of B's   year used to determine its current-year costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S uses dollar-value LIFO. If S uses a dollar-value LIFO  inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory sales, S may  use any reasonable method of allocating its LIFO inventory costs to  intercompany transactions. LIFO inventory costs include costs of prior  layers if a decrement occurs. For example, a reasonable allocation of  the most recent costs incurred during the consolidated return year can  be used to compute S's intercompany inventory income or loss for the  year if S has an inventory increment and uses the earliest acquisitions  costs method, but S must apportion costs from the most recent  appropriate layers of increment if an inventory decrement occurs for the  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other reasonable methods. S or B may use a method not  specifically provided in this paragraph (e)(1) that is expected to  reasonably take into account intercompany items and corresponding items  from intercompany inventory transactions. However, if the method used  results, for any year, in a cumulative amount of intercompany inventory  items not taken into account by S that significantly exceeds the  cumulative amount that would not be taken into account under paragraph  (e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, S must take into account for that  year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess. The method is  thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect the amount  taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The inventory rules of this paragraph (e)(1) are  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. Both S and B use a  double-extension, dollar-value LIFO inventory method, and both value  inventory increments using the earliest acquisitions cost valuation  method. During Year 2, S sells 25 units of product Q to B on January 15  at $10/unit. S sells another 25 units on April 15, on July 15, and on  September 15, at $12/unit. S's earliest cost of product Q is $7.50/unit  and S's most recent cost of product Q is $8.00/unit. Both S and B have  an inventory increment for the year. B's total inventory costs incurred  during Year 2 are $6,000 and the LIFO value of B's Year 2 layer of  increment is $600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intercompany inventory income. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of  this section, S must use a reasonable method of allocating its LIFO  inventory costs to intercompany transactions. Because S has an inventory  increment for Year 2 and uses the earliest acquisitions cost method, a  reasonable method of determining its intercompany cost of goods sold for  product Q is to use its most recent costs. Thus, its intercompany cost  of goods sold is $800 ($8.00 most recent cost, multiplied by 100 units  sold to B), and its intercompany inventory income is $350 ($1,150 sales  proceeds from B minus $800 cost).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the increment averaging method of paragraph  (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, $35 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory  income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY95.002</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thus, $315 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into  account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $35  not taken into account).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> S incurs a decrement. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)  of this Example 1, except that in Year 2, S incurs a decrement equal to  50% of its Year 1 layer. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, S  must reasonably allocate the LIFO cost of the decrement to the cost of  goods sold to B to determine S's intercompany inventory income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> B incurs a decrement. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)  of this Example 1, except that B incurs a decrement in Year 2. S must  take into account the entire $350 of Year 2 intercompany inventory  income because all 100 units of product Q are deemed sold by B in Year  2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as  in Example 1. In addition, B's use of the earliest acquisition's cost  method of valuing its increments results in B valuing its year-end  inventory using costs incurred from January through March. B's costs  incurred during the year are: $1,428 in the period January through  March; $1,498 in the period April through June; $1,524 in the period  July through September; and $1,550 in the period October through  December. S's intercompany inventory income for these periods is: $50 in  the period January through March ((25x$10)-(25x$8)); $100 in the period  April through June ((25x$12)-(25x$8)); $100 in the period July through  September ((25x$12)-(25x$8)); and $100 in the period October through  December ((25x$12)-(25x$8)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the increment valuation method of paragraph  (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, $21 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory  income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY95.003</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thus, $329 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into  account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $21  not taken into account).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> B incurs a subsequent decrement. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (a) of this Example 2. In addition, assume that in Year 3, B  experiences a decrement in its pool that receives intercompany purchases  from S. B's decrement equals 20% of the base-year costs for its Year 2  layer. The fact that B has incurred a decrement means that all of its  inventory costs incurred for Year 3 are included in cost of goods sold.  As a result, S takes into account its entire amount of intercompany  inventory income from its Year 3 sales. In addition, S takes into  account $4.20 of its Year 2 layer of intercompany inventory income not  already taken into account (20% of $21).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. Both S and  B use a dollar-value LIFO inventory method for their inventory  transactions. During Year 1, S sells inventory to B and to X. Under  paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, to compute its intercompany  inventory income and the amount of this income not taken into account, S  computes its intercompany inventory income using the transfer price of  the inventory items less a FIFO cost for the goods, takes into account  these items based on a FIFO cost flow assumption for B's corresponding  items, and the LIFO methods used by S and B are ignored for these  computations. These computations are comparable to the methods used by S  and B for financial reporting purposes, and the book methods and results  are used for tax purposes. S adjusts the amount of intercompany  inventory items not taken into account as required by section 263A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable method. The method used by S is a reasonable method  under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section if the cumulative amount of  intercompany inventory items not taken into account by S is not  significantly greater than the cumulative amount that would not be taken  into account under the methods specifically described in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section. If, for any year, the method results in a  cumulative amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account  by S that significantly exceeds the cumulative amount that would not be  taken into account under the methods specifically provided, S must take  into account for that year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess.  The method is thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect  the amount taken into account (e.g., to prevent the amount from being  taken into account more than once).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reserve accounting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Banks and thrifts. Except as provided in  paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this section (deferral of items from an  intercompany obligation), a member's addition to, or reduction of, a  reserve for bad debts that is maintained under section 585 is taken into  account on a separate entity basis. For example, if S makes a loan to a  nonmember and subsequently sells the loan to B, any deduction for an  addition to a bad debt reserve under section 585 and any recapture  income (or reduced bad debt deductions) are taken into account on a  separate entity basis rather than as intercompany items or corresponding  items taken into account under this section. Any gain or loss of S from  its sale of the loan to B is taken into account under this section,  however, to the extent it is not attributable to recapture of the  reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Insurance companies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Direct insurance. If a member provides  insurance to another member in an intercompany transaction, the  transaction is taken into account by both members on a separate entity  basis. For example, if one member provides life insurance coverage for  another member with respect to its employees, the premiums, reserve  increases and decreases, and death benefit payments are determined and  taken into account by both members on a separate entity basis rather  than taken into account under this section as intercompany items and  corresponding items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reinsurance--(1) In general. Paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this  section does not apply to a reinsurance transaction that is an  intercompany transaction. For example, if a member assumes all or a  portion of the risk on an insurance contract written by another member,  the amounts transferred as reinsurance premiums, expense allowances,  benefit reimbursements, reimbursed policyholder dividends, experience  rating adjustments, and other similar items are taken into account under  the matching rule and the acceleration rule. For purposes of this  section, the assuming company is treated as B and the ceding company is  treated as S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reserves determined on a separate entity basis. For purposes of  determining the amount of a member's increase or decrease in reserves,  the amount of any reserve item listed in section 807(c) or 832(b)(5)  resulting from a reinsurance transaction that is an intercompany  transaction is determined on a separate entity basis. But see section  845, under which the Commissioner may allocate between or among the  members any items, recharacterize any such items, or make any other  adjustments necessary to reflect the proper source and character of the  separate taxable income of a member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity  basis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The common parent may request consent to take  into account on a separate entity basis items from intercompany  transactions other than intercompany transactions with respect to stock  or obligations of members. Consent may be granted for all items, or for  items from a class or classes of transactions. The consent is effective  only if granted in writing by the Internal Revenue Service. Unless  revoked with the written consent of the Internal Revenue Service, the  separate entity treatment applies to all affected intercompany  transactions in the consolidated return year for which consent is  granted and in all subsequent consolidated return years. Consent under  this paragraph (e)(3) does not apply for purposes of taking into account  losses and deductions deferred under section 267(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time and manner for requesting consent. The request for consent  described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be made in the  form of a ruling request. The request must be signed by the common  parent, include any information required by the Internal Revenue  Service, and be filed on or before the due date of the consolidated  return (not including extensions of time) for the first consolidated  return year to which the consent is to apply. The Internal Revenue  Service may impose terms and conditions for granting consent. A copy of  the consent must be attached to the group's consolidated returns (or  amended returns) as required by the terms of the consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of consent on methods of accounting. A consent for  separate entity accounting under this paragraph (e)(3), and a revocation  of that consent, may require changes in members' methods of accounting  for intercompany transactions. Because the consent, or a revocation of  the consent, is effective for all intercompany transactions occurring in  the consolidated return year for which the consent or revocation is  first effective, any change in method is effected on a cut-off basis.  Section 446(e) consent is granted for any changes in methods of  accounting for intercompany transactions that are necessary solely to  conform a member's methods to a binding consent with respect to the  group under this paragraph (e)(3) or the revocation of that consent,  provided the changes are made in the first consolidated return year for  which the consent or revocation under this paragraph (e)(3) is  effective. Therefore, section 446(e) consent must be separately   requested under applicable administrative procedures if a member has  failed to conform its practices to the separate entity accounting  provided under this paragraph (e)(3) or the revocation of that treatment  in the first consolidated return year for which the consent to use  separate entity accounting or revocation of that consent is effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity  basis under prior law. A group that has received consent that is in  effect as of the first day of the first consolidated return year  beginning on or after July 12, 1995 to treat certain intercompany  transactions as provided in Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(3) of the regulations (as  contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995) will  be considered to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner to take  items from intercompany transactions into account on a separate entity  basis as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. This treatment  is applicable only to the items, class or classes of transactions for  which consent was granted under prior law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Stock of members--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In addition to the general  rules of this section, the rules of this paragraph (f) apply to stock of  members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intercompany distributions to which section 301 applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. This paragraph (f)(2) provides rules for intercompany  transactions to which section 301 applies (intercompany distributions).  For purposes of determining whether a distribution is an intercompany  distribution, it is treated as occurring under the principles of the  entitlement rule of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. A distribution  is not an intercompany distribution to the extent it is deducted by the  distributing member. See, for example, section 1382(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributee member. An intercompany distribution is not  included in the gross income of the distributee member (B). However,  this exclusion applies to a distribution only to the extent there is a  corresponding negative adjustment reflected under Sec. 1.1502-32 in B's  basis in the stock of the distributing member (S). For example, no  amount is included in B's gross income under section 301(c)(3) from a  distribution in excess of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary that  results in an excess loss account under Sec. 1.1502-32(a) which is  treated as negative basis under Sec. 1.1502-19. B's dividend received  deduction under section 243(a)(3) is determined without regard to any  intercompany distributions under this paragraph (f)(2) to the extent  they are not included in gross income. See Sec. 1.1502-26(b)  (applicability of the dividends received deduction to distributions not  excluded from gross income, such as a distribution from the common  parent to a subsidiary owning stock of the common parent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distributing member. The principles of section 311(b) apply to  S's loss, as well as gain, from an intercompany distribution of  property. Thus, S's loss is taken into account under the matching rule  if the property is subsequently sold to a nonmember. However, section  311(a) continues to apply to distributions to nonmembers (for example,  loss is not recognized).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Entitlement rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For all Federal income tax  purposes, an intercompany distribution is treated as taken into account  when the shareholding member becomes entitled to it (generally on the  record date). For example, if B becomes entitled to a cash distribution  before it is made, the distribution is treated as made when B becomes  entitled to it. For this purpose, B is treated as entitled to a  distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into  account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305(c)). To  the extent a distribution is not made, appropriate adjustments must be  made as of the date it was taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonmember shareholders. If nonmembers own stock of the  distributing corporation at the time the distribution is treated as  occurring under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), appropriate adjustments must  be made to prevent the acceleration of the distribution to members from  affecting distributions to nonmembers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Boot in an intercompany reorganization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Scope. This  paragraph (f)(3)   provides additional rules for an intercompany transaction in which the  receipt of money or other property (nonqualifying property) results in  the application of section 356. For example, the distribution of stock  of a lower-tier member to a higher-tier member in an intercompany  transaction to which section 355 would apply but for the receipt of  nonqualifying property is a transaction to which this paragraph (f)(3)  applies. This paragraph (f)(3) does not apply if a party to the  transaction becomes a member or nonmember as part of the same plan or  arrangement. For example, if S merges into a nonmember in a transaction  described in section 368(a)(1)(A), this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> applies for all Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acquisition by issuer of its own stock. If a member acquires its  own stock, or an option to buy or sell its own stock, in an intercompany  transaction, the member's basis in that stock or option is treated as  eliminated for all purposes. Accordingly, S's intercompany items from  the stock or options of B are taken into account under this section if B  acquires the stock or options in an intercompany transaction (unless,  for example, B acquires the stock in exchange for successor property  within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1) of this section in a  nonrecognition transaction). For example, if B redeems its stock from S  in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies, S's gain from the  transaction is taken into account immediately under the acceleration  rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> applies only to a transaction in which B's  basis in its T stock is permanently eliminated in a liquidation under  section 332 or any comparable nonrecognition transaction, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A merger of B into T under section 368(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A distribution by B of its T stock in a transaction described in  section 355; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A deemed liquidation of T resulting from an election under  section 338(h)(10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elective relief--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If an election is made  pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), certain transactions are  recharacterized to prevent S's items from being taken into account or to  provide offsets to those items. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii) applies only  if T is a member throughout the period beginning with S's transfer and  ending with the completion of the nonrecognition transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 332--(1) In general. If section 332 would otherwise  apply to T's (old T's) liquidation into B, and B transfers substantially  all of old T's assets to a new member (new T), and if a direct transfer  of substantially all of   old T's assets to new T would qualify as a reorganization described in  section 368(a), then, for all Federal income tax purposes, T's  liquidation into B and B's transfer of substantially all of old T's  assets to new T will be disregarded and instead, the transaction will be  treated as if old T transferred substantially all of its assets to new T  in exchange for new T stock and the assumption of T's liabilities in a  reorganization described in section 368(a). (Under paragraph (j)(1) of  this section, B's stock in new T would be a successor asset to B's stock  in old T, and S's gain would be taken into account based on the new T  stock.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time limitation and adjustments. The transfer of old T's assets  to new T qualifies under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B)(1) of this section only  if B has entered into a written plan, on or before the due date of the  group's consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the  tax year that includes the date of old T's liquidation, to transfer the  old T assets to new T, and the statement described in paragraph  (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section is included on or with a timely filed  consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year  that includes the date of the liquidation. However, in the case of a  liquidation of old T on or after October 25, 2007, by a taxpayer whose  original tax return for the year of liquidation was filed on or before  November 3, 2009, see Sec. 1.1502-13T(f)(5)(ii)(F)(3) as contained in 26  CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2012. In either case, the transfer of  substantially all of T's assets to new T must be completed within 12  months of the filing of the return. Appropriate adjustments are made to  reflect any events occurring before the formation of new T and to  reflect any assets not transferred to new T, or liabilities not assumed  by new T. For example, if B retains an asset of old T, the asset is  treated under paragraph (f)(3) of this section as acquired by new T but  distributed to B immediately after the reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> does not apply if paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B)  of this section is applied to the deemed liquidation. Under this  paragraph, B is treated with respect to each share of its T stock as  recognizing as a corresponding item any loss or deduction it would  recognize (determined after adjusting stock basis under Sec. 1.1502-32)  if section 331 applied to the deemed liquidation. For all other Federal  income tax purposes, the deemed liquidation remains subject to section  332.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on amount of loss. The amount of B's loss or  deduction under this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) is limited as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of loss recognized with respect to T stock  cannot exceed the amount of S's intercompany income or gain that is in  excess of S's intercompany deduction or loss with respect to shares of T  stock having the same material terms as the shares giving rise to S's  intercompany income or gain; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)</em> from T's deemed liquidation cannot exceed the net amount  of deduction or loss (if any) that would be taken into account from the  deemed liquidation if section 331 applied with respect to all T shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Asset sale, etc. The principles of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C)  apply, with appropriate adjustments, if T transfers all of its assets to  a nonmember and completely liquidates in a transaction comparable to the  section 338(h)(10) transaction described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C)(1)  of this section. For example, if S sells all of T's stock to B at a gain  followed by T's merger into a nonmember in exchange for a cash payment  to B in a transaction treated for Federal income tax purposes as T's  sale of its assets to the nonmember and complete liquidation, the merger  is ordinarily treated as a comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> applies to treat B's  distribution as subject to sections 301 and 311 (as modified by this  paragraph (f)), rather than section 355. The election will prevent S's  gain or loss from being taken into account immediately to the extent  matching remains possible, but B's gain or loss from the distribution  will also be taken into account under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Election. An election to apply paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this  section is made in a separate statement entitled, ``[INSERT NAME AND  EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF COMMON PARENT] HEREBY ELECTS THE  APPLICATION OF Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii) FOR AN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTION  INVOLVING [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF S] AND  [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF T].'' A separate  election must be made for each such application.

If the nonmember was a member  of another consolidated group immediately before becoming a   member of the P group, the reduction in basis is treated as occurring  immediately after it ceases to be a member of the prior group. A  qualifying cost basis transaction is the purchase (i.e., a transaction  in which basis is determined under section 1012) by members of the P  consolidated group (while they are members) in a 12-month period of an  amount of the nonmember's stock satisfying the requirements of section  1504(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election.

This  paragraph (f)(6) applies with appropriate adjustments to positions in P  stock to the extent that P's gain or loss from an equivalent position  would not be recognized under section 1032. Thus, if M purchases an  option to buy or sell P stock and sells the option at a loss, the loss  is permanently disallowed under paragraph (f)(6)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section.

If P grants M an  option to acquire P stock in a transaction meeting the requirements of  Sec. 1.1032-3, M is treated as having purchased the option from P for  fair market value with cash contributed to M by P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Mark-to-market of positions in P stock.

This paragraph (f)(6) applies to gain or loss  taken into account on or after July 12, 1995, and to transactions  occurring on or after July 12, 1995. For example, if S sells P stock to  B at a loss prior to July 12, 1995, and B sells the P stock to a  nonmember after July 12, 1995, S's loss is disallowed because it is  taken into account after July 12, 1995. If a taxpayer takes a gain or  loss into account or engages in a transaction on or after July 12, 1995,  during a tax year ending prior to December 31, 1995, the taxpayer may  treat the gain or loss or the transaction under the rules published in  1995-32 I.R.B. 47, instead of under the rules of this paragraph (f)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples-- In general. The application of this section to  intercompany transactions with respect to stock of members is  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts.  S owns land with a $70 basis and $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, P's  basis in S's stock is $100. During Year 1, S declares and makes a  dividend distribution of the land to P. Under section 311(b), S has a  $30 gain. Under section 301(d), P's basis in the land is $100. On July 1  of Year 3, P sells the land to X for $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section, S's distribution to P is an  intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section,  P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross income. Under  Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is reduced from $100 to $0 in  Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Matching rule and stock basis adjustments. Under the matching  rule (treating P as the buying member and S as the selling member), S  takes its $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference  between P's $10 gain taken into account and the $40 recomputed gain.  Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is increased from $0 to $30  in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Loss property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 1, except that S has a $130 (rather than $70) basis in the  land. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the principles of  section 311(b) apply to S's loss from the intercompany distribution.  Thus, S has a $30 loss that is taken into account under the matching  rule in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between P's $10 gain taken  into account and the $20 recomputed loss. (The results are the same  under section 267(f).) Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is  reduced from $100 to $0 in Year 1, and from $0 to a $30 excess loss  account in Year 3. (If P had distributed the land to its shareholders,  rather than selling the land to X, P would take its $10 gain under  section 311(b) into account, and S would take its $30 loss into account  under the matching rule with $10 offset by P's gain and $20  recharacterized as a noncapital, nondeductible amount.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Entitlement rule. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 1, except that, after P becomes entitled to the  distribution but before the distribution is made, S issues additional  stock to the public and becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)  of this section, the determination of whether a distribution is an  intercompany distribution is made under the entitlement rule of  paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. Treating S's distribution as made  when P becomes entitled to it results in the distribution being an  intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section,  the distribution is not included in P's gross income. S's $30 gain from  the distribution is intercompany gain that is taken into account under  the acceleration rule immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus,  there is a net $70 decrease in P's basis in its S stock under  Sec. 1.1502-32 ($100 decrease for the distribution and a $30 increase  for S's $30 gain). Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, P does  not take the distribution into account again under separate return rules  when received, and P is not entitled to a dividends received deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S owns all of T's only  class of stock with a $10 basis and $100 value. S has substantial  earnings and profits, and T has $10 of earnings and profits. On January  1 of Year 1, S declares and distributes a dividend of all of the T stock  to P. Under section 311(b), S has a $90 gain. Under section 301(d), P's  basis in the T stock is $100. During Year 3, T borrows $90 and declares  and makes a $90 distribution to P to which section 301 applies, and P's  basis in the T stock is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-32 from $100 to $10.  During Year 6, T has $5 of earnings that increase P's basis in the T  stock under Sec. 1.1502-32 from $10 to $15. On December 1 of Year 9, T  issues additional stock to X and, as a result, T becomes a nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividend exclusion. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section,  P's $100 of dividend income from S's distribution of the T stock, and  its $10 of dividend income from T's $90 distribution, are not included  in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Matching and acceleration rules. Under Sec. 1.1502-19(b)(1),  when T becomes a nonmember P must include in income the amount of its  excess loss account (if any) in T stock. P has no excess loss account in  the T stock. Therefore P's corresponding item from the deconsolidation  of T is $0. Treating S and P as divisions of a single corporation, the T  stock would continue to have a $10 basis after the distribution, and the  adjustments under Sec. 1.1502-32 for T's $90 distribution and $5 of  earnings would result in a $75 excess loss account. Thus, the recomputed  corresponding item from the deconsolidation is $75. Under the matching  rule, S takes $75 of its $90 gain into account in Year 9 as a result of  T becoming a nonmember, to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain  taken into account and the $75 recomputed gain. S's remaining $15 of  gain is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules  based on subsequent events (for example, under the matching rule if P  subsequently sells its T stock, or under the acceleration rule if S  becomes a nonmember).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> P's initial basis in the T stock is $10 (the  stock's fair market value), and the basis increases to $15 under  Sec. 1.1502-32 as a result of T's earnings in Year 6. The timing and  attributes of S's gain are determined in the manner provided in  paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into  account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a  nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the  matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Partial stock sale. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)  of this Example 2, except that P sells 10% of T's stock to X on December  1 of Year 9 for $1.50 (rather than T's issuing additional stock and  becoming a nonmember). Under the matching rule, S takes $9 of its gain  into account to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain taken into  account ($1.50 sale proceeds minus $1.50 basis) and the $9 recomputed  gain ($1.50 sale proceeds plus $7.50 excess loss account).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Loss, rather than cash distribution. The facts are the same as  in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, except that T retains the loan  proceeds and incurs a $90 loss in Year 3 that is absorbed by the group.  The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner  provided in paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Under Sec. 1.1502-32, the  loss in Year 3 reduces P's basis in the T stock from $100 to $10, and  T's $5 of earnings in Year 6 increase the basis to $15. Thus, $75 of S's  gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result  of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account  under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.  (The timing and attributes of S's gain would be determined in the same  manner provided in paragraph (d) of this Example 2 if T incurred the $90  loss before S's distribution of the T stock to P.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Stock sale, rather than stock distribution. The facts are the  same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, except that S sells the T  stock to P for $100 (rather than distributing the stock). The timing and  attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner provided in  paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into  account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a  nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the  matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. P forms S and B  by contributing $200 to the capital of each. During Years 1 through 4, S  and B each earn $50, and under Sec. 1.1502-32 P adjusts its basis in the  stock of each to $250. (See Sec. 1.1502-33 for adjustments to earnings  and profits.) On January 1 of Year 5, the fair market value of S's  assets and its stock is $500, and S merges into B in a tax-free  reorganization. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, P receives B  stock with a fair market value of $350 and $150 of cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment as a section 301 distribution. The merger of S into B  is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies. P is  treated as receiving additional B stock with a fair market value of $500  and, under section 358, a basis of $250. Immediately after the merger,  $150 of the stock received is treated as redeemed, and the redemption is  treated under section 302(d) as a distribution to which section 301  applies. Because the $150 distribution is treated as not received as  part of the merger, section 356 does not apply and no basis adjustments  are required under section 358(a)(1)(A) and (B). Because B is treated  under section 381(c)(2) as receiving S's earnings and profits and the  redemption is treated as occurring after the merger, $100 of the  distribution is treated as a dividend under section 301 and P's basis in  the B stock is reduced correspondingly under Sec. 1.1502-32. The  remaining $50 of the distribution reduces P's basis in the B stock.  Section 301(c)(2) and Sec. 1.1502-32. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this  section, P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross income.  Under Sec. 1.302-2(c), proper adjustments are made to P's basis in its B  stock to reflect its basis in the B stock redeemed, with the result that  P's basis in the B stock is reduced by the entire $150 distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Depreciated property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)  of this Example 3, except that property of S with a $200 basis and $150  fair market value is distributed to P (rather than cash of B). As in  paragraph (b) of this Example 3, P is treated as receiving additional B  stock in the merger and a $150 distribution to which section 301 applies  immediately after the merger. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this  section, the principles of section 311(b) apply to B's $50 loss and the  loss is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules  based on subsequent events (e.g., under the matching rule if P  subsequently sells the property, or under the acceleration rule if B  becomes a nonmember). The results are the same under section 267(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Divisive transaction. Assume instead that, pursuant to a plan, S  distributes the stock of a lower-tier subsidiary in a spin-off  transaction to which section 355 applies together with $150 of cash. The  distribution of stock is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this  section applies. P is treated as receiving the $150 of cash immediately  before   the section 355 distribution, as a distribution to which section 301  applies. Section 356(b) does not apply and no basis adjustments are  required under section 358(a)(1) (A) and (B). Because the $150  distribution is treated as made before the section 355 distribution, the  distribution reduces P's basis in the S stock under Sec. 1.1502-32, and  the basis allocated under section 358(c) between the S stock and the  lower-tier subsidiary stock received reflects this basis reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(D)</em>. Pursuant to  Sec. 1.368-2(l), B will be deemed to issue a nominal share of B stock to  S in addition to the $100 of cash actually exchanged for the S assets,  and S will be deemed to distribute all of the consideration to M. M will  be deemed to distribute the nominal share of B stock to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of $75, to be subsequently  taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gain under section 302. Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section,  P's basis in the P stock acquired from S is treated as eliminated. As a  result of this elimination, S's intercompany item will never be taken  into account under the matching rule because P's basis in the stock does  not reflect S's intercompany item. Therefore, S's $70 gain is taken into  account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. The attributes of S's  item are determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section by  applying the matching rule as if P had sold the stock to an affiliated  corporation that is not a member of the group at no gain or loss.  Although P's corresponding item from a sale of its stock would have been  excluded from gross income under section 1032, paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of  this section prevents S's gain from being treated as excluded from gross  income; instead S's gain is capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gain under section 311. The facts are the same as in paragraph  (a) of this Example 4, except that S distributes the P stock to P in a  transaction to which section 301 applies (rather than the stock being  redeemed), and S has a $70 gain under section 311(b). The timing and  attributes of S's gain are determined in the manner provided in  paragraph (b) of this Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Loss stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this  Example 4, except that S has a $130 (rather than $30) basis in the P  stock and has a $30 loss under section 302(a). The limitation under  paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to intercompany  losses. Thus, S's loss is taken into account in Year 3 as a noncapital,  nondeductible amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S owns all of the stock of T, with a $70 basis  and $100 value, and T's assets have a $10 basis and $100 value. On  January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to B for $100. On July 1  of Year 3, when T's assets are still worth $100, T distributes all of  its assets to B in an unrelated complete liquidation to which section  332 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(ii)</em> of this  section, B's unrecognized gain or loss under section 332 is a  corresponding item for purposes of applying the matching rule. In Year 3  when T liquidates, B has $0 of unrecognized gain or loss under section  332 because B has a $100 basis in the T stock and receives a $100  distribution with respect to its T stock. Treating S and B as divisions  of a single corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would have  been $30 of unrecognized gain under section 332 because B would have  succeeded to S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under the matching  rule, S's $30 intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 3 as a  result of T's liquidation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,  the attributes of S's gain and B's corresponding item are redetermined  as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain  ordinarily would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross  income to reflect the nonrecognition of B's gain under section 332, S's  gain remains capital gain because B's unrecognized gain under section  332 is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code. See  paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. However, relief may be elected  under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)(ii)</em> of  this section does not apply to intercompany losses. Thus, S's  intercompany loss is taken into account in Year 3 as a noncapital,  nondeductible amount. However, relief may be elected under paragraph  (f)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S owns all of the stock of T with a $70 basis  and a $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to M  for $100. On June 1 of Year 6, M distributes all of its T stock to its  nonmember shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies. At  the time of the distribution, M has a basis in T stock of $100 and T has  a value of $150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(ii)</em> of this  section, M's $50 gain not recognized on the distribution under section  355 is a corresponding item. Treating S and M as divisions of a single  corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would be $80 of  unrecognized gain under section 355 because M would have succeeded to  S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under the matching rule, S's $30  intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 6 as a result of the  distribution. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the attributes  of S's intercompany item and M's corresponding item are redetermined to  produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and M  were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain ordinarily  would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross income to  reflect the nonrecognition of M's gain under section 355(c), S's gain  remains capital gain because M's unrecognized gain under section 355(c)  is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code. See  paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. Because M's distribution of the T  stock is not an intercompany transaction, relief is not available under  paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 355 distribution within the group. The facts are the  same as under paragraph (a) of this Example 6, except that M distributes  the T stock to B (another member of the group), and B takes a $75 basis  in the T stock under section 358. Under paragraph (j)(2) of this  section, B is a successor to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany  gain into account, and therefore both M and B might have corresponding  items with respect to S's intercompany gain. To the extent it is  possible, matching with respect to B's corresponding items produces the  result most consistent with treating S, M, and B as divisions of a  single corporation. See paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(4) of this section.  However, because there is only $5 difference between B's $75 basis in  the T stock and the $70 basis the stock would have if S, M, and B were  divisions of a single corporation, only $5 can be taken into account  under the matching rule with respect to B's corresponding items. (This  $5 is taken into account with respect to B's corresponding items based  on subsequent events.) The remaining $25 of S's $30 intercompany gain is  taken into account in Year 6 under the matching rule with respect to M's  corresponding item from its distribution of the T stock. The attributes  of S's remaining $25 of gain are determined in the same manner as in  paragraph (b) of this Example 6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Relief elected. The facts are the same as in paragraph (c) of  this Example 6 except that P elects relief pursuant to paragraph  (f)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. As a result of the election, M's  distribution of the T stock is treated as subject to sections 301 and  311 instead of section 355. Accordingly, M recognizes $50 of  intercompany gain from the distribution, B takes a basis in the stock  equal to its fair market value of $150, and S and M take their  intercompany gains into account with respect to B's corresponding items  based on subsequent events. (None of S's gain is taken into account in  Year 6 as a result of M's distribution of the T stock.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Obligations of members--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Any intercompany  transaction in which a member realizes an amount, directly or  indirectly, from the assignment or extinguishment of all or part of its  remaining rights or obligations under an intercompany obligation or any  comparable transaction in which a member realizes any such amount,  directly or indirectly, from an intercompany obligation (for example, a  mark to fair market value of an obligation or a bad debt deduction).  However, a reduction of the basis of an intercompany obligation pursuant  to Sec. 1.1502-36(d) (attribute reduction to prevent duplication of  loss), or pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and Sec. 1.1502-28 (basis  reductions upon the exclusion from gross income of discharge of  indebtedness) or any other provision that adjusts the basis of an  intercompany obligation as a substitute for income, gain, deduction, or  loss, is not a comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Outbound transactions.

The transaction  is an intercompany exchange to which section 361(a), sections 332 and  337(a), or (except as provided in the following sentence) section 351  applies in which no amount of income, gain, deduction or loss is  recognized by the creditor or debtor. The assignment of an intercompany  obligation by a creditor member in an intercompany exchange to which  section 351 applies is a triggering transaction, notwithstanding the  preceding sentence, if a member of the group is described in, or engages  in a transaction that is described in, any of the following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor or transferee member has a loss subject to a  limitation (for example, a loss from a separate return limitation year  that is subject to limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c), or a dual  consolidated loss that is subject to limitation under Sec. 1.1503(d)-4),  but only if   the other member is not subject to a comparable limitation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor or transferee member has a special status within  the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(5) (for example, a bank defined in  section 581, or a life insurance company subject to tax under section  801) that the other member does not also possess;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A member of the group realizes discharge of indebtedness  income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) within  the same taxable year as that of the exchange, and the tax attributes  attributable to either the transferor or the transferee member are  reduced under sections 108, 1017, and Sec. 1.1502-28 (except if the  attribute reduction results solely from the application of Sec. 1.1502- 28(a)(4) (reduction of certain tax attributes attributable to other  members));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The transferee member has a nonmember shareholder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The transferee member issues preferred stock to the transferor  member in exchange for the assignment of the intercompany obligation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The stock of the transferee member (or a higher-tier member  other than a higher-tier member of an 80-percent chain that includes the  transferor and transferee) is disposed of within 12 months from the  assignment of the intercompany obligation, unless at the time of the  assignment, the transferor member, transferee member (or in the case of  successive section 351 exchanges, each transferor and transferee member)  and the debtor member are all in the same 80-percent chain; and all of  the stock of the transferee (or in the case of successive section 351  exchanges, the lowest-tier transferee) held by members of the group is  disposed of as part of the same plan or arrangement, either directly or  indirectly, to persons that are not members of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intercompany assumption transaction.

All or part of the  rights and obligations under the intercompany obligation are  extinguished in an intercompany transaction (other than an exchange or  deemed exchange of an intercompany obligation for a newly issued  intercompany obligation), the adjusted issue price of the obligation is  equal to the creditor's basis in the obligation, and the debtor's  corresponding item and the creditor's intercompany item (after taking  into account the special rules of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this  section) with respect to the obligation offset in amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Routine modification of intercompany obligation. All of the  rights and obligations under the intercompany obligation are  extinguished in an intercompany transaction that is an exchange (or  deemed exchange) for a newly issued intercompany obligation, and the  issue price of the newly issued obligation equals both the adjusted  issue price of the extinguished obligation and the creditor's basis in  the extinguished obligation. Solely for purposes of the preceding  sentence, a newly issued intercompany obligation includes an obligation  that is issued (or deemed issued) by a member other than the original  debtor if such other member assumes the original debtor's obligations  under the original obligation in a transaction that is described in  either paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(1) or (g)(3)(i)(B)(2) of this section and  the assumption results in a significant modification of the original  obligation under Sec. 1.1001-3(e)(4) and a deemed exchange under  Sec. 1.1001-3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Outbound distribution of newly issued intercompany obligation.  The intercompany obligation becomes an obligation that is not an  intercompany obligation in a transaction in which a   member that is a party to the reorganization exchanges property in  pursuance of the plan of reorganization for a newly issued intercompany  obligation of another member that is a party to the reorganization and  distributes such intercompany obligation to a nonmember shareholder or  nonmember creditor in a transaction to which section 361(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Outbound subgroup exception. The intercompany obligation becomes  an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation in a transaction in  which the members of an intercompany obligation subgroup cease to be  members of a consolidated group, neither the creditor nor the debtor  recognize any income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to the  intercompany obligation, and such members constitute an intercompany  obligation subgroup of another consolidated group immediately after the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tax benefit rule.

If the intercompany obligation is debt of a  member, then (except as provided in the following sentence) the debt is  treated for all Federal income tax purposes as having been satisfied by  the debtor for cash in an amount equal to its fair market value, and  then as having been reissued as a new obligation (with a new holding  period but otherwise identical terms) for the same amount of cash,  immediately before the triggering transaction. However, if the creditor  realizes an amount with respect to the debt in the triggering  transaction that differs from the debt's fair market value, and the  triggering transaction is not an exchange (or deemed exchange) of debt  of a member for newly issued debt of a member, then the debt is treated  for all Federal income tax purposes as having been satisfied by the  debtor for cash in an amount equal to such amount realized, and reissued  as a new obligation (with a new holding period but otherwise identical  terms) for the same amount of cash, immediately before the triggering  transaction. If the triggering transaction is a mark to fair market  value under section 475, then the intercompany obligation will be deemed  satisfied and reissued for its fair market value (as determined under  section 475 and applicable regulations) and section 475 will not  otherwise apply with respect to that triggering transaction. If the  intercompany obligation is a security of a member, similar principles  apply (with appropriate adjustments) to treat the security as having  been satisfied and reissued immediately before the triggering  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment as separate transaction. The deemed satisfaction and  deemed reissuance are treated as transactions separate and apart from  the triggering transaction. The deemed satisfaction and reissuance of a  member's debt will not cause the debt to be recharacterized as other  than debt for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Timing and attributes.

If an  intercompany obligation is exchanged (or is deemed exchanged) for a  newly issued intercompany obligation and the exchange (or deemed  exchange) is not a routine modification of an intercompany obligation  (as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(6) of this section), then the  newly issued obligation will be treated for all Federal income tax  purposes as having an issue price equal to its fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> will be made without regard to the application of,  and in lieu of any adjustment under, section 467 (certain payments for  the use of property or services), 482 (allocations among commonly  controlled taxpayers), 483 (interest on certain deferred payments), 1274  (determination of issue price for certain debt instruments issued for  property), or 7872 (treatment of loans with below-market interest  rates).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deferral of loss or deduction with respect to nonmember  indebtedness acquired in certain debt exchanges. If a creditor transfers  an intercompany obligation to a nonmember (former intercompany  obligation) in exchange for newly issued debt of a nonmember (nonmember  debt), and the issue price of the nonmember debt is not determined by  reference to its fair market value (for example, the issue price is  determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274(a) or any other provision of  applicable law), then any loss of the creditor otherwise allowable on  the subsequent disposition of the nonmember debt, or any comparable tax  benefit that would otherwise be available in any other transaction that  directly or indirectly results from the disposition of the nonmember  debt, is deferred until the date the debtor retires the former  intercompany obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Bad debt reserve. A member's deduction under section 585 for an  addition to its reserve for bad debts with respect to an intercompany  obligation is not taken into account, and is not treated as realized for  purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this section, until the  intercompany obligation is extinguished or becomes an obligation that is  not an intercompany obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deemed satisfaction and reissuance of obligations becoming  intercompany obligations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of deemed satisfaction and  reissuance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.   This paragraph (g)(5) applies if an obligation that is not an  intercompany obligation becomes an intercompany obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions.

The obligation becomes an  intercompany obligation in a transaction in which the members of an  intercompany obligation subgroup cease to be members of a consolidated  group, neither the creditor nor the debtor recognize any income, gain,  deduction, or loss with respect to the intercompany obligation, and such  members constitute an intercompany obligation subgroup of another  consolidated group immediately after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed satisfaction and reissuance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. If the  intercompany obligation is debt of a member, then the debt is treated  for all Federal income tax purposes, immediately after it becomes an  intercompany obligation, as having been satisfied by the debtor for cash  in an amount determined under the principles of Sec. 1.108-2(f), and  then as having been reissued as a new obligation (with a new holding  period but otherwise identical terms) for the same amount of cash. If  the intercompany obligation is a security of a member, similar  principles apply (with appropriate adjustments) to treat the security,  immediately after it becomes an intercompany obligation, as satisfied  and reissued by the debtor for cash in an amount equal to its fair  market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment as separate transaction. The deemed satisfaction and  deemed reissuance are treated as transactions separate and apart from  the transaction in which the debt becomes an intercompany obligation,  and the tax consequences of the transaction in which the debt becomes an  intercompany obligation must be determined before the deemed  satisfaction and reissuance occurs. (For example, if the debt becomes an  intercompany obligation in a transaction to which section 351 applies,  any limitation imposed by section 362(e) on the basis of the  intercompany obligation in the hands of the transferee member is  determined before the deemed satisfaction and reissuance.) The deemed  satisfaction and reissuance of a member's debt will not cause the debt  to be recharacterized as other than debt for Federal income tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Timing and attributes. If paragraph (g)(5) of  this section applies to an intercompany obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Section 108(e)(4) does not apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The attributes of all items taken into account from the  satisfaction of the intercompany obligation are determined on a separate  entity basis, rather than by treating S and B as divisions of a single  corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any intercompany gain or loss realized by the creditor is not  subject to section 354 or section 1091.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver of loss carryovers from separate return limitation  years. Solely for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) and the effect of any  election under that provision, any loss taken into account under  paragraph (g)(5) of this section by a corporation that becomes a member  as a result of the transaction in which the obligation becomes an  intercompany obligation is treated as a loss carryover from a separate  return limitation year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deduction of repurchase premium in certain debt exchanges. If  an obligation to which paragraph (g)(5) of this section applies is  acquired in exchange for the issuance of an obligation to a nonmember  and the issue price of this newly issued obligation is not determined by  reference to its fair market value (for example, the issue price is  determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274(a) or any other provision of  applicable law), then, under the principles of Sec. 1.163-7(c), any  repurchase premium from the deemed satisfaction of the intercompany  obligation under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section will be amortized  by the debtor over the term of the obligation issued to the nonmember in  the same manner as if it were original issue discount and the   obligation to the nonmember had been issued directly by the debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of the examples in this  paragraph (g), unless otherwise stated, interest is qualified stated  interest under Sec. 1.1273-1(c), and the intercompany obligations are  capital assets and are not subject to section 475.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of this section to obligations of members is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On  January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note  providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and  repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. B fully performs its  obligations. Under their separate entity methods of accounting, B  accrues a $10 interest deduction annually under section 163, and S  accrues $10 of interest income annually under section 61(a)(4) and  Sec. 1.446-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Matching rule. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the  accrual of interest on B's note is an intercompany transaction. Under  the matching rule, S takes its $10 of income into account in each of  years 1 through 5 to reflect the $10 difference between B's $10 of  interest expense taken into account and the $0 recomputed expense. S's  income and B's deduction are ordinary items. (Because S's intercompany  item and B's corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate  entity basis, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Original issue discount. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 1, except that B borrows $90 (rather than  $100) from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest  annually and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. The principles  described in paragraph (ii) of this Example 1 for stated interest also  apply to the $10 of original issue discount. Thus, as B takes into  account its corresponding expense under section 163(e), S takes into  account its intercompany income under section 1272. S's income and B's  deduction are ordinary items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tax-exempt income. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 1, except that B's borrowing from S is allocable under  section 265 to B's purchase of state and local bonds to which section  103 applies. The timing of S's income is the same as in paragraph (ii)  of this Example 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the  attributes of B's corresponding item of disallowed interest expense  control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany interest income.  Paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not prevent the redetermination of  S's intercompany item as excluded from gross income because section  265(a)(2) permanently and explicitly disallows B's corresponding  deduction and because, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this section,  paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to prevent any  intercompany income from the B note from being excluded from gross  income. Accordingly, S's intercompany income is treated as excluded from  gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in  return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of  each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1  of year 3, B has paid the interest accruing under the note and S sells  B's note to X for $70, reflecting an increase in prevailing market  interest rates. B is never insolvent within the meaning of section  108(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, B's note is treated  as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $70 immediately  before S's sale to X. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note  for less than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of  discharge of indebtedness income under Sec. 1.61-12. On a separate  entity basis, S's $30 loss would be a capital loss under section  1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's  intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to  produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between  divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section, the attributes of B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness income  control the attributes of S's loss. Thus, S's loss is treated as  ordinary loss. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the  satisfaction, a new note to S with a $70 issue price, a $100 stated  redemption price at maturity, and a $70 basis in the hands of S. S is  then treated as selling the new note to X for the $70 received by S in  the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $70 in the new note, S  recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new  note held by X is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue  price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $70 basis. The  $30 of original issue discount will be taken into account by B and X  under sections 163(e) and 1272.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Creditor deconsolidation. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 2, except that P sells S's stock to X  (rather than S selling B's note to X). Because the B note becomes an  obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a  triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this section.  Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as  satisfied and reissued for its $70   fair market value immediately before S becomes a nonmember. The  treatment of S's $30 of loss and B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness  income is the same as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 2. The new note  held by S upon deconsolidation is not an intercompany obligation, it has  a $70 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $70  basis. The $30 of original issue discount will be taken into account by  B and S under sections 163(e) and 1272.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Debtor deconsolidation. The facts are the same as in paragraph  (i) of this Example 2, except that P sells B's stock to X (rather than S  selling B's note to X). The results to S and B are the same as in  paragraph (iii) of this Example 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subgroup exception. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 2, except that P owns all of the stock of S, S owns all  of the stock of B, and P sells all of the S stock to X, the parent of  another consolidated group. Because B and S, members of an intercompany  obligation subgroup, cease to be members of the P group in a transaction  that does not cause either member to recognize an item with respect to  the B note, and such members constitute an intercompany obligation  subgroup in the X group, P's sale of S stock is not a triggering  transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(8) of this section, and the  note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)  of this section. After the sale, the note held by S has a $100 issue  price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $100 basis. The  results are the same if the S stock is sold to an individual and the S-B  affiliated group elects to file a consolidated return for the period  beginning on the day after S and B cease to be members of the P group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Section 338 election. The facts are the same as paragraph (i)  of this Example 2, except that P sells S's stock to X and a section 338  election is made with respect to the stock sale. Under section 338, S is  treated as selling all of its assets to new S, including the B note, at  the close of the acquisition date. The aggregate deemed sales price  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.338-4) allocated to the B note is $70.  Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany  obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph  (g)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this  section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued immediately  before S's deemed sale to new S for $70, the amount realized with  respect to the note (the aggregate deemed sales price allocated to the  note under Sec. 1.338-6). The results to S and B are the same as in  paragraph (ii) of this Example 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Appreciated note. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 2, except that S sells B's note to X for $130 (rather  than $70), reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates.  Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany  obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph  (g)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this  section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair  market value of $130 immediately before S's sale to X. As a result of  the deemed satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted issue  price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under Sec. 1.163- 7(c). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain  under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the  attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be  redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had  occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction  control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as  ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the  satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100 stated  redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S. S is  then treated as selling the new note to X for the $130 received by S in  the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $130 in the new note, S  recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new  note held by X is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $130 issue  price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $130 basis. The  treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new note is  determined under Sec. 1.163-13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Deferral of loss or deduction with respect to nonmember  indebtedness acquired in debt exchange. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 2, except that S sells B's note to X for a  non-publicly traded X note with an issue price and face amount of $100  and a fair market value of $70, and that, subsequently, S sells the X  note for $70. Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an  intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction  under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this section. Under paragraph  (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and  reissued immediately before S's sale to X for $100, the amount realized  with respect to the note (determined under section 1274). As a result of  the deemed satisfaction, neither S nor B take into account any items of  income, gain, deduction, or loss. S is then treated as selling the new B  note to X for the X note received by S in the actual transaction.  Because S has a basis of $100 in the new note, S recognizes no gain or  loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new B note held by X is not  an intercompany obligation, it has a $100 issue price, a $100 stated  redemption price at maturity, and a $100 basis. S also   holds an X note with a basis of $100 but a fair market value of $70.  When S disposes of the X note, S's loss on the disposition is deferred  under paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of this section, until B retires its note  (the former intercompany obligation in the hands of X).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in  return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of  each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. On January 1 of  year 3, the fair market value of the B note has declined to $60 and S  sells the B note to P for property with a fair market value of $60. B is  never insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3). The B note is  not a security within the meaning of section 165(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, B's note is treated as  satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $60 immediately  before S's sale to P. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note  for less than its adjusted issue price ($100), B takes into account $40  of discharge of indebtedness income under Sec. 1.61-12. On a separate  entity basis, S's $40 loss would be a capital loss under section  1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's  intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to  produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between  divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section, the attributes of B's $40 of discharge of indebtedness income  control the attributes of S's loss. Thus, S's loss is treated as  ordinary loss. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the  satisfaction, a new note to S with a $60 issue price, $100 stated  redemption price at maturity, and $60 basis in the hands of S. S is then  treated as selling the new note to P for the $60 of property received by  S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $60 in the new  note, S recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to P. After the sale,  the note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $60 issue price and a  $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and the $40 of original issue  discount will be taken into account by B and P under sections 163(e) and  1272.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partial bad debt deduction. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 3, except that S claims a $40 partial bad  debt deduction under section 166(a)(2) (rather than selling the note to  P). Because S realizes a deduction from a transaction comparable to an  assignment of the B note, the transaction is a triggering transaction  under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this section. Under paragraph  (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and  reissued for its fair market value of $60 immediately before section  166(a)(2) applies. The treatment of S's $40 loss and B's $40 of  discharge of indebtedness income are the same as in paragraph (ii) of  this Example 3. After the reissuance, S has a basis of $60 in the new  note. Accordingly, the application of section 166(a)(2) does not result  in any additional deduction for S. The $40 of original issue discount on  the new note will be taken into account by B and S under sections 163(e)  and 1272.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Insolvent debtor. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of  this Example 3, except that B is insolvent within the meaning of section  108(d)(3) at the time that S sells the note to P. As explained in  paragraph (ii) of this Example 3, the transaction is a triggering  transaction and the B note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its  fair market value of $60 immediately before S's sale to P. On a separate  entity basis, S's $40 loss would be capital, B's $40 income would be  excluded from gross income under section 108(a), and B would reduce  attributes under section 108(b) or section 1017 (see also Sec. 1.1502- 28). However, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section, section  108(a) does not apply to characterize B's income as excluded from gross  income. Accordingly, the attributes of S's loss and B's income are  redetermined in the same manner as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On  January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note  providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and  repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has  fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value is  $130, reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. On  January 1 of year 3, S transfers the note and other assets to a newly  formed corporation, Newco, for all of Newco's common stock in an  exchange to which section 351 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Receipt of other property. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 4, except that the other assets  transferred to Newco have a basis of $100 and a fair market value of  $260, and S receives, in addition to Newco common stock, $15 of cash.  Because S would recognize $15 of gain under section 351(b), the  assignment of the B note is a triggering transaction under paragraph   (g)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this  section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair  market value of $130 immediately before the transfer to Newco. As a  result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted  issue price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under  Sec. 1.163-7(c). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a  capital gain under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however,  the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must  be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had  occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction  control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as  ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the  satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100 stated  redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S. S is  then treated as transferring the new note to Newco for the Newco stock  and cash received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis  of $130 in the new B note, S recognizes no gain or loss with respect to  the transfer of the note in the section 351 exchange, and S recognizes  $10 of gain with respect to the transfer of the other assets under  section 351(b). After the transfer, the note has a $130 issue price and  a $100 stated redemption price at maturity. The treatment of B's $30 of  bond issuance premium under the new note is determined under Sec. 1.163- 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transferee loss subject to limitation. The facts are the same  as in paragraph (i) of this Example 4, except that T is a member with a  loss from a separate return limitation year that is subject to  limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) (a SRLY loss), and on January 1 of  year 3, S transfers the assets and the B note to T in an exchange to  which section 351 applies. Because the transferee, T, has a loss that is  subject to a limitation, the assignment of the B note is a triggering  transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this section (the  exception in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(1) of this section does not apply).  Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as  satisfied and reissued for its fair market value, immediately before S's  transfer to T. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for  more than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of  repurchase premium under Sec. 1.163-7(c). On a separate entity basis,  S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section 1271(a)(1). Under the  matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's  corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if  the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation.  Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium  deduction control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is  treated as ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately  after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100  stated redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S.  The treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new note is  determined under Sec. 1.163-13. S is then treated as transferring the  new note to T as part of the section 351 exchange. Because T will have a  fair market value basis in the reissued B note immediately after the  exchange, T's intercompany item from the subsequent retirement of the B  note will not reflect any of S's built-in gain (and the amount of T's  SRLY loss that may be absorbed by such item will be limited to any  appreciation in the B note accruing after the exchange).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Intercompany obligation transferred in section 332 transaction.  The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 4, except  that S transfers the B note to P in complete liquidation under section  332. Because the transaction is an exchange to which section 332 and  section 337(a) applies, and neither S nor B recognize gain or loss, the  transaction is not a triggering transaction under paragraph  (g)(3)(i)(B)(1) of this section, and the note is not treated as  satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On  January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note  providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and  repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. The note is fully recourse and  is incurred for use in Business Z. As of January 1 of year 3, B has  fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value is  $110 reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. Business  Z has a fair market value of $95. On January 1 of year 3, B transfers  all of the assets of Business Z and $15 of cash (substantially all of  B's assets) to member T in exchange for the assumption by T of all of  B's obligations under the note in a transaction in which gain or loss is  recognized under section 1001. The terms and conditions of the note are  not modified in connection with the sales transaction, the transaction  does not result in a change in payment expectations, and no amount of  income, gain, deduction, or loss is recognized by S, B, or T with  respect to the note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On  January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note   providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and  repayment of $100 at the end of year 20. The note is a security within  the meaning of section 351(d)(2). As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully  performed its obligations, but the fair market value of the B note is  $130, reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates, and S  transfers the note to B in exchange for $130 of B stock in a transaction  to which both section 351 and section 354 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. On a  separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under  section 1271(a)(1).

Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section, the attributes of B's premium deduction control the attributes  of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as ordinary income. Under  paragraph (g)(4)(i)(D) of this section, section 108(e)(7) does not apply  upon the extinguishment of the B note, and therefore, the B stock  received by S in the exchange will not be treated as section 1245  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On  January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note  providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and  repayment of $100 at the end of year 20. As of January 1 of year 3, B  has fully performed its obligations and, pursuant to a recapitalization  to which section 368(a)(1)(E) applies, B issues a new note to S in  exchange for the original B note. The new B note has an issue price,  stated redemption price at maturity, and stated principal amount of  $100, but contains terms that differ sufficiently from the terms of the  original B note to cause a realization event under Sec. 1.1001-3. The  original B note and the new B note are both securities (within the  meaning of section 354(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. B has neither income from  discharge of indebtedness under section 108(e)(10) nor a deduction for  repurchase premium under Sec. 1.163-7(c). Although the exchange of the  original B note for the new B note is a transaction to which section 354  applies, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section, any gain or loss  from the intercompany obligation is not subject to section 354. Under  section 1001, S has no gain or loss from the exchange of notes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1 of year 1, B  borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest  annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of  year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its  obligations, but the note's fair market value has depreciated,  reflecting an increase in prevailing market interest rates. On that  date, S transfers the B note to member T as part of an exchange for T  common stock which is intended to qualify for nonrecognition treatment  under section 351 but with a view to sell the T stock at a reduced gain.  On February 1 of year 4, all of the stock of T is sold at a reduced  gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied  and reissued for its fair market value, immediately before S's transfer  to T. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for less than  its adjusted issue price, B takes into account discharge of indebtedness  income and S has a corresponding loss which is treated as ordinary loss.  B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the deemed  satisfaction, a new note to S with an issue price and basis equal to its  fair market value. S is then treated as transferring the new note to T  as part of the section 351 exchange. Because S's basis in the T stock  received with respect to the transferred B note is equal to its fair   market value, S's gain with respect to the T stock will not reflect any  of the built-in loss attributable to the B note. (This example does not  address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply to  recharacterize the transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment  of the transaction.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. T is  a member with a SRLY loss. T's sole shareholder, P, borrows an amount of  cash from T in return for a P note that provides for a materially above  market rate of interest. The P note is issued with a view to generate  additional interest income to T over the term of the note to facilitate  the absorption of T's SRLY loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With a view. Because the P note is issued with a view to shift  interest income from the off-market obligation in order to secure a tax  benefit that the group or its members would not otherwise enjoy, under  paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, the intercompany obligation is  treated, for all Federal income tax purposes, as originally issued for  its fair market value so T is treated as purchasing the note at a  premium. The difference between the amount loaned and the fair market  value of the obligation is treated as transferred from P to T as a  capital contribution at the time the note is issued. Throughout the term  of the note, T takes into account interest income and bond premium and P  takes into account interest deduction and bond issuance premium under  generally applicable Internal Revenue Code sections. The adjustment  under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section is made without regard to  the application of, and in lieu of any adjustment under, section 482 or  1274.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from X in  return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of  each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1  of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair  market value is $70, reflecting an increase in prevailing market  interest rates. On January 1 of year 3, P buys all of X's stock. B is  solvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied for $70 (determined  under the principles of Sec. 1.108-2(f)(2)) immediately after it becomes  an intercompany obligation. Both X's $30 capital loss (under section  1271(a)(1)) and B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness income (under  Sec. 1.61-12) are taken into account in determining consolidated taxable  income for year 3. Under paragraph (g)(6)(i)(B) of this section, the  attributes of items resulting from the satisfaction are determined on a  separate entity basis. But see section 382 and Sec. 1.1502-15 (as  appropriate). B is also treated as reissuing a new note to X. The new  note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue price and $100  stated redemption price at maturity, and the $30 of original issue  discount will be taken into account by B and X in the same manner as  provided in paragraph (iii) of Example 1 of this paragraph (g)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, B's $30  of repurchase premium from the deemed satisfaction is amortized by B  over the term of the newly issued P note in the same manner as if it  were original issue discount and the newly issued P note had been issued  directly by B. B is also treated as reissuing a new note to P. The new  note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $130 issue price and $100  stated redemption price at maturity, and the treatment of B's $30 of  bond issuance premium under the new B note is determined under  Sec. 1.163-13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election to file consolidated returns. Assume instead that B  borrows $100 from S during year 1, but the P group does not file  consolidated returns until year 3. Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this  section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued as a new note  immediately after the note becomes an intercompany obligation. The  satisfaction and reissuance are deemed to occur on January 1 of year 3,  for the fair market value of the obligation (determined under the  principles of Sec. 1.108-2(f)(2)) at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On April 1 of  year 1, M1 enters into a contract with counterparty M2 under which, for  a term of five years, M1 is obligated to make a payment to M2 each April  1, beginning in year 2, in an amount equal to the London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined by reference to LIBOR on the day  each payment is due, multiplied by a $1,000 notional principal amount.  M2 is obligated to make a payment to M1 each April 1, beginning in year  2, in an amount equal to 8 percent multiplied by the same notional  principal amount. LIBOR is 7.80 percent on April 1 of year 2, and  therefore, M2 owes $2 to M1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Matching rule. Under Sec. 1.446-3(d), the net income (or net  deduction) from a notional principal contract for a taxable year is  included in (or deducted from) gross income.   Under Sec. 1.446-3(e), the ratable daily portion of M2's obligation to  M1 as of December 31 of year 1 is $1.50 ($2 multiplied by 275/365).  Under the matching rule, M1's net income for year 1 of $1.50 is taken  into account to reflect the difference between M2's net deduction of  $1.50 taken into account and the $0 recomputed net deduction. Similarly,  the $.50 balance of the $2 of net periodic payments made on April 1 of  year 2 is taken into account for year 2 in M1's and M2's net income and  net deduction from the contract. In addition, the attributes of M1's  intercompany income and M2's corresponding deduction are redetermined to  produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between  divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section, the attributes of M2's corresponding deduction control the  attributes of M1's intercompany income. (Although M1 is the selling  member with respect to the payment on April 1 of year 2, it might be the  buying member in a subsequent period if it owes the net payment.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dealer. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this  Example 11, except that M2 is a dealer in securities, and the contract  with M1 is not inventory in the hands of M2. Under section 475, M2 must  mark its securities to fair market value at year-end. Assume that under  section 475, M2's loss from marking to fair market value the contract  with M1 is $10. Because M2 realizes an amount of loss from the mark to  fair market value of the contract, the transaction is a triggering  transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(1) of this section. Under  paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, M2 is treated as making a $10  payment to M1 to terminate the contract immediately before a new  contract is treated as reissued with an up-front payment by M1 to M2 of  $10. M1's $10 of income from the termination payment is taken into  account under the matching rule to reflect M2's deduction under  Sec. 1.446-3(h). The attributes of M1's intercompany income and M2's  corresponding deduction are redetermined to produce the same effect as  if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single  corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes  of M2's corresponding deduction control the attributes of M1's  intercompany income. Accordingly, M1's income is treated as ordinary  income. Under Sec. 1.446-3(f), the deemed $10 up-front payment by M1 to  M2 in connection with the issuance of a new contract is taken into  account over the term of the new contract in a manner reflecting the  economic substance of the contract (for example, allocating the payment  in accordance with the forward rates of a series of cash-settled forward  contracts that reflect the specified index and the $1,000 notional  principal amount). (The timing of taking items into account is the same  if M1, rather than M2, is the dealer subject to the mark-to-market  requirement of section 475 at year-end. However in this case, because  the attributes of the corresponding deduction control the attributes of  the intercompany income, M1's income from the deemed termination payment  from M2 might be ordinary or capital). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of  this section, section 475 does not apply to mark the notional principal  contract to fair market value after its deemed satisfaction and  reissuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Effective/applicability date.

The anti-avoidance rules of this paragraph (h) are  illustrated by the following examples. The examples set forth below do  not address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply  to recast a transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment of a  transaction.

S owns land  with a $10 basis and $100 value. B has net operating losses from  separate return limitation years (SRLYs) subject to limitation under  Sec. 1.1502-21(c). Pursuant to a plan to absorb the losses without  limitation by the SRLY rules, S transfers the land to an unrelated,  calendar-year partnership in exchange for a 10% interest in the capital  and profits of the partnership in a transaction to which section 721  applies. The partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect.  S later sells its partnership interest to B for $100. In the following  year, the partnership sells the land to X for $100. Because the  partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect, its $10  basis in the land does not reflect B's $100 basis in the partnership  interest. Under section 704(c), the partnership's $90 built-in gain is  allocated to B, and B's basis in the partnership interest increases to  $190 under section 705. In a later year, B sells the partnership  interest to a nonmember for $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments. Under Sec. 1.1502-21(c), the partnership's $90  built-in gain allocated to B ordinarily increases the amount of B's SRLY  limitation, and B's $90 loss from its sale of the partnership interest  ordinarily is not subject to limitation under the SRLY rules. Because  the contribution of property to the partnership and the sale of the  partnership interest were part of a plan a principal purpose of which  was to achieve a reduction in consolidated tax liability by creating  offsetting gain and loss for B while deferring S's intercompany gain,  B's allocable share of the partnership's gain from its sale of the land  is treated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not increasing the  amount of B's SRLY limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> to take into account a $30 loss with respect to the  note. Pursuant to a plan to permit X to take into account its $30 loss  without disposing of the note, P acquires an additional 10% of X's  stock, causing X to become a member, and P subsequently resells the 10%  interest. X's $30 loss with respect to the note is a net unrealized  built-in loss within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments. Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, X  ordinarily would take into account its $30 loss as a result of the note  becoming an intercompany obligation, and S would take into account $30  of discharge of indebtedness income. Under Sec. 1.1502-22, X's loss is  not combined with items of the other members and the loss would be  carried to X's separate return years as a result of X becoming a  nonmember. However, the transitory status of S's indebtedness to X as an  intercompany obligation is structured with a principal purpose to  accelerate the recognition of X's loss. Thus, S's note is treated under  paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not becoming an intercompany  obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. M1 and M2 are  subsidiaries of P. M1 operates a manufacturing business on land it  leases from M2. The land is the only asset held by M2. P intends to  dispose of the M1 business, including the land owned by M2; P's basis in  the M1 stock is equal to the stock's fair market value. M2's land has a  value of $20 and a basis of $0 and P has a $0 basis in the stock of M2.  In Year 1, with a principal purpose of avoiding gain from the sale of  the land (by transferring the land to M1 with a carry-over basis without  affecting P's basis in the stock of M1 or M2), M1 and M2 form  corporation T; M1 contributes cash in exchange for 80% of the T stock  and M2 contributes the land in exchange for 20% of the stock. In Year 3,  T liquidates, distributing $20 cash to M2 and the land (plus $60 cash)  to M1. Under Sec. 1.1502-34, section 332 applies to both M1 and M2.  Under section 337, T recognizes no gain or loss from its liquidating  distribution of the land to M1. T has neither gain nor loss on its  distribution of cash to M2. In Year 4, P sells all of the stock of M1 to  X and liquidates M2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments. A principal purpose for the formation and  liquidation of T was to avoid gain from the sale of M2's land. Thus,  under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, M2 must take $20 of gain into  account when the stock of M1 is sold to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> and claims that M2's basis in the  intangible asset is $100 under section 732 and that the asset is  eligible for amortization under section 197.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments. A principal purpose of the formation and  liquidation of PRS was to create additional amortization without an  offsetting increase in consolidated taxable income by avoiding treatment  as an intercompany transaction. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, appropriate adjustments must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S operates a factory with  a $70 basis and $100 value, and has loss carryovers from SRLYs. Pursuant  to a plan to take into account the $30 unrealized gain while continuing  to operate the factory, S sells the factory to X for $100 and leases it  back on a long-term basis. In the transaction, a substantial interest in  the factory is transferred to X. The sale and leaseback are not  recharacterized under general principles of Federal income tax law. As a  result of S's sale to X, the $30 gain is taken into account and  increases S's SRLY limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No adjustments. Although S's sale was pursuant to a plan to  accelerate the $30 gain, it is not subject to adjustment under paragraph  (h)(1) of this section. The sale is not treated as engaged in or  structured with a   principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Miscellaneous operating rules. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Successor assets. Any reference to an asset includes, as the  context may require, a reference to any other asset the basis of which  is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference  to the basis of the first asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Successor persons--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Any reference to a person  includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or  successor. For this purpose, a predecessor is a transferor of assets to  a transferee (the successor) in a transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To which section 381(a) applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are  transferred to members in a complete liquidation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In which the successor's basis in assets is determined (directly  or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of the  transferor, but the transferee is a successor only with respect to the  assets the basis of which is so determined; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to  assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior  intercompany transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Intercompany items. If the assets of a predecessor are acquired  by a successor member, the successor succeeds to, and takes into account  (under the rules of this section), the predecessor's intercompany items.  If two or more successor members acquire assets of the predecessor, the  successors take into account the predecessor's intercompany items in a  manner that is consistently applied and reasonably carries out the  purposes of this section and applicable provisions of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiple triggers. If more than one corresponding item can cause  an intercompany item to be taken into account under the matching rule,  the intercompany item is taken into account in connection with the  corresponding item most consistent with the treatment of members as  divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells a truck to B,  its intercompany gain from the sale is not taken into account by  reference to B's depreciation if the depreciation is capitalized under  section 263A as part of B's cost for a building; instead, S's gain  relating to the capitalized depreciation is taken into account when the  building is sold or as it is depreciated. Similarly, if B purchases  appreciated land from S and transfers the land to a lower-tier member in  exchange for stock, thereby duplicating the basis of the land in the  basis of the stock, items with respect to both the stock and the land  can cause S's intercompany gain to be taken into account; if the lower- tier member becomes a nonmember as a result of the sale of its stock,  the attributes of S's intercompany gain are determined with respect to  the land rather than the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiple or successive intercompany transactions. If a member's  intercompany item or corresponding item affects the accounting for more  than one intercompany transaction, appropriate adjustments are made to  treat all of the intercompany transactions as transactions between  divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells property to  M, and M sells the property to B, then S, M, and B are treated as  divisions of a single corporation for purposes of applying the rules of  this section. Similar principles apply with respect to intercompany  transactions that are part of the same plan or arrangement. For example,  if S sells separate properties to different members as part of the same  plan or arrangement, all of the participating members are treated as  divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the  attributes (which might also affect timing) of the intercompany items  and corresponding items from each of the properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Acquisition of group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Scope. This paragraph (j)(5) applies  only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to exist as  a result of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The acquisition of either the assets of the common parent of the  terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or  the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The application of the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or  (d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. If the terminating group ceases to exist under  circumstances described in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, the  surviving group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of  applying this section to the intercompany transactions of the  terminating group. For example, intercompany items and corresponding  items from intercompany transactions between members of the terminating  group are taken into account under the rules of this section by the  surviving group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of  the terminating group that are not members of the surviving group  immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (for example,  under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c)  relating to includible insurance companies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Former common parent treated as continuation of group. If a  group terminates because the common parent is the only remaining member,  the common parent succeeds to the treatment of the terminating group for  purposes of applying this section so long as it neither becomes a member  of an affiliated group filing separate returns nor becomes a corporation  described in section 1504(b). For example, if the only subsidiary of the  group liquidates into the common parent in a complete liquidation to  which section 332 applies, or the common parent merges into the  subsidiary and the subsidiary is treated as the common parent's  successor under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the taxable income  of the surviving corporation is treated as the group's consolidated  taxable income in which the intercompany and corresponding items must be  included. See Sec. 1.267(f)-1 for additional rules applicable to  intercompany losses or deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Becoming a nonmember. For purposes of this section, a member is  treated as becoming a nonmember if it has a separate return year  (including another group's consolidated return year). A member is not  treated as having a separate return year if its items are treated as  taken into account in computing the group's consolidated taxable income  under paragraph (j)(5) or (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recordkeeping. Intercompany and corresponding items must be  reflected on permanent records (including work papers). See also section  6001, requiring records to be maintained. The group must be able to  identify from these permanent records the amount, location, timing, and  attributes of the items, so as to permit the application of the rules of  this section for each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The operating rules of this paragraph (j) are  illustrated generally throughout this section, and by the following  examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On  January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to M for $100. M also holds the  land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M transfers the land to B in  exchange for all of B's stock in a transaction to which section 351  applies. Under section 358, M's basis in the B stock is $100. B holds  the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and,  under section 362(b), B's basis in the land is $100. On December 1 of  Year 5, M sells 20% of the B stock to X for $22. In an unrelated  transaction on July 1 of Year 8, B sells 20% of the land for $22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. Because B  acquired the land in an intercompany transaction, B's items from the  land are corresponding items to be taken into account under this  section. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph (j)(1) of this  section, references to the land include references to M's B stock. Under  the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2) of this section,  references to M include references to B with respect to the land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> of this section, S's $6 gain and M's  $2 gain are treated as long-term capital gain. The gain would be capital  on a separate entity basis (assuming that section 341 does not apply),  and this treatment is not inconsistent with treating S, M, and B as  divisions of a single corporation because the stock sale and subsequent  land sale are unrelated transactions and B remains a member following  the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Timing and attributes resulting from the land sale. Under  paragraph (j)(3) of this section, S takes $6 of its gain into account in  Year 8 under the matching rule to reflect the $6 difference between B's  $2 gain taken into account from its sale of an interest in the land and  the $8 recomputed gain. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the  attributes of this gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as  divisions of a single corporation and taking into account the activities  of S, M, and B with respect to the land. Thus, both S's gain and B's  gain might be ordinary income as a result of B's activities. (If B  subsequently sells the balance of the land, S's gain taken into account  is limited to its remaining $18 of intercompany gain.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sale of successor stock resulting in deconsolidation. The facts  are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that M sells  60% of the B stock to X for $66 on December 1 of Year 5 and B becomes a  nonmember. Under the matching rule, M's sale of B stock results in $18  of S's gain being taken into account (to reflect the difference between  M's $6 gain taken into account and the $24 recomputed gain). Under the  acceleration rule, however, the entire $30 gain is taken into account  (to reflect B becoming a nonmember, because its basis in the land  reflects M's $100 cost basis from the prior intercompany transaction).  Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of S's gain are  determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation.  Because M's cost basis in the land will be reflected by B as a  nonmember, all of S's gain is treated as from the land (rather than a  portion being from B's stock), and B's activities with respect to the  land might therefore result in S's gain being ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(E)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing and attributes. Although P's basis in the stock acquired  from M is eliminated under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the new P  stock received by M is exchanged basis property (within the meaning of  section 7701(a)(44)) having a basis under section 358 equal to M's basis  in the original P stock. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph  (j)(1) of this section, references to M's original P stock include  references to M's new P stock. Because it is still possible to take S's  intercompany item into account under the matching rule with respect to  the successor asset, S's gain is not taken into account under the  acceleration rule as a result of the basis elimination under paragraph  (f)(4) of this section. Instead, the gain is taken into account based on  subsequent events with respect to M's new P stock (for example, a  subsequent distribution or redemption of the new stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of  Year 1, S sells the land to M for $90. M also holds the land for  investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M sells the land for $100 to B, and B  holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  During Year 5, B sells all of the land to customers for $105.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section, S's sale of the  land to M and M's sale of the land to B are both intercompany  transactions. S is the selling member and M is the buying member in the  first intercompany transaction, and M is the selling member and B is the  buying member in the second intercompany transaction. Under paragraph  (j)(4) of this section, S, M and B are treated as divisions of a single  corporation for purposes of determining the timing of their items from  the intercompany transactions. See also paragraph (j)(2) of this section  (B is treated as a successor to M for purposes of taking S's  intercompany gain into account). Thus, S's $20 gain and M's $10 gain are  both taken into account in Year 5 to reflect the difference between B's  $5 gain taken into account with respect to the land and the $35  recomputed gain (the gain that B would have taken into account if the  intercompany sales had been transfers between divisions of a single  corporation, and B succeeded to S's $70 basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Attributes. Under paragraphs (j)(4) of this section, the  attributes of the intercompany items and corresponding items of S, M,  and B are also determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a  single corporation. For example, the attributes of S's and M's  intercompany items are determined by taking B's activities into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  Facts. During Year 1, S performs services for M in exchange for $10 from  M. S incurs $8 of employee expenses. M capitalizes the $10 cost of S's  services under section 263 as part of M's cost to acquire real property  from X. Under its separate entity method of accounting, S would take its  income and expenses into account in Year 1. M   holds the real property for investment and, on July 1 of Year 5, M sells  it to B at a gain. B also holds the real property for investment. On  December 1 of Year 8, while B still owns the real property, P sells all  of M's stock to X and M becomes a nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> M's items. M takes its gain into account immediately before it  becomes a nonmember. Because the real property stays in the group, the  acceleration rule redetermines the attributes of M's gain under the  principles of the matching rule as if B sold the real property to an  affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group for a cash  payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the real property, and S, M, and  B were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, M's gain is capital  gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> S's items. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S  includes the $8 of expenses in determining its $2 intercompany income.  In Year 1, S takes into account $8 of income and $8 of expenses. Under  paragraph (j)(4) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made  to treat both S's performance of services for M and M's sale to B as  occurring between divisions of a single corporation. Thus, S's $2 of  intercompany income is not taken into account as a result of M becoming  a nonmember, but instead will be taken into account based on subsequent  events (e.g., under the matching rule based on B's sale of the real  property to a nonmember, or under the acceleration rule based on P's  sale of the stock of S or B to a nonmember). See the successor person  rules of paragraph (j)(2) of this section (B is treated as a successor  to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany income into account).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sale of S's stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of  this Example 4, except that P sells all of S's stock (rather than M's  stock) and S becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 5. S's remaining $2  of intercompany income is taken into account immediately before S  becomes a nonmember. Because S's intercompany income is not from an  intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, the attributes  of the intercompany income are determined on a separate entity basis.  Thus, S's $2 of intercompany income is ordinary income. M does not take  any of its intercompany gain into account as a result of S becoming a  nonmember.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Intercompany income followed by intercompany loss. The facts are  the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that M sells the  real property to B at a $1 loss (rather than a gain). M takes its $1  loss into account under the acceleration rule immediately before M  becomes a nonmember. But see Sec. 1.267(f)-1 (which might further defer  M's loss if M and B remain in a controlled group relationship after M  becomes a nonmember). Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section appropriate  adjustments must be made to treat the group as if both intercompany  transactions occurred between divisions of a single corporation.  Accordingly, P's sale of M stock also results in S taking into account  $1 of intercompany income as capital gain to offset M's $1 of  corresponding capital loss. The remaining $1 of S's intercompany income  is taken into account based on subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, B  borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest  annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of  Year 20. As of January 1 of Year 3, B has paid the interest accruing  under the note. On that date, X acquires all of P's stock and the former  P group members become members of the X consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Successor. Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, although B's  note ceases to be an intercompany obligation of the P group, the note is  not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this  section as a result of X's acquisition of P stock. Instead, the X  consolidated group succeeds to the treatment of the P group for purposes  of paragraph (g) of this section, and B's note is treated as an  intercompany obligation of the X consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> in the assets received from X, and S has  a $0 basis under section 334(b) in the assets received from X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intercompany items from the liquidation. Under the matching  rule, X's $40 gain from its liquidating distribution to B is not taken  into account under this section as a result of the liquidation (and  therefore is not yet reflected under Secs. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33).  Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section,  S and B are both successors to X. Under section 337(c), X recognizes  gain or loss only with respect to the assets distributed to B. Under  paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the purposes  of this section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain. The gain will  be taken into account by S under the matching and acceleration rules of  this section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the  intercompany gain to S does not govern the allocation of any other  attributes.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts. X has only  common stock outstanding. On January 1 of Year 1, S buys 60% of X's  stock for $60, and B buys 40% of X's stock for $40. X's assets have a $0  basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, X distributes all of its  assets to S and B in a complete liquidation. Under Sec. 1.1502-34,  section 332 applies to both S and B. Under sections 336 and 337(c), X  has a $100 gain from its liquidating distributions to S and B. Under  section 334(b), S has a $60 basis in the assets received from X and B  has a $40 basis in the assets received from X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intercompany items from the liquidation. Under the matching  rule, X's $100 intercompany gain from its liquidating distributions to S  and B is not taken into account under this section as a result of the  liquidation (and therefore is not yet reflected under Secs. 1.1502-32  and 1.1502-33). Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i)  of this section, S and B are both successors to X. Under paragraph  (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the purposes of this  section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain with respect to the  assets distributed to B, and B succeeds to X's $60 intercompany gain  with respect to the assets distributed to S. The gain will be taken into  account by S and B under the matching and acceleration rules of this  section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the intercompany  gain does not govern the allocation of any other attributes.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Cross references--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 108.

This section  applies with respect to transactions occurring in years beginning on or  after July 12, 1995. If both this section and prior law apply to a  transaction, or neither applies, with the result that items may be  duplicated, omitted, or eliminated in determining taxable income (or tax  liability), or items may be treated inconsistently, prior law (and not  this section) applies to the transaction. For example, S's and B's items  from S's sale of property to B which occurs in a consolidated return  year beginning before July 12, 1995, are taken into account under prior  law, even though B may dispose of the property in a consolidated return  year beginning on or after July 12, 1995. Similarly, an intercompany  distribution to which a shareholder becomes entitled in a consolidated  return year beginning before July 12, 1995, but which is distributed in  a consolidated return year beginning on or after that date is taken into  account under prior law (generally when distributed), because this  section generally takes dividends into account when the shareholder  becomes entitled to them but this section does not apply at that time.  If application of prior law to S's deferred gain or loss from a deferred  intercompany transaction (as defined under prior law) occurring in a  consolidated return year beginning prior to July 12, 1995, would be  affected by an intercompany transaction (as defined under this section)  occurring in a consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12,  1995, S's deferred gain or loss continues to be taken into account as  provided under prior law, and the items from the subsequent intercompany  transaction are taken into account under this section. Appropriate  adjustments must be made to prevent items from being duplicated,omitted,  or eliminated in determining taxable income as a result of the  application of both this section and prior law to the successive  transactions, and to ensure the proper application of prior law.  Paragraphs (a)(4), (f)(6)(ii), (f)(6)(iv)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(B)(2), and  (j)(5)(i)(A) of this section apply with respect to transactions  occurring on or after September 17, 2008.
