You must establish the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance (i.e., after the compliance date but prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance subsequent to conducting the initial comprehensive performance test) of an existing source as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You must obtain a minimum of three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data, provided in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter, and PMDS data to establish an approximate correlation curve. Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the compliance date may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of your determination whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> You must approximate the correlation of the reference method data to the PMDS data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You may assume a linear correlation of the PMDS response to particulate matter emission concentrations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow one or more of the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained, to the extent possible, by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Zero point data also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(9)(ii)(B)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are possible, you must estimate the monitor response when no PM is in the flue gas (e.g., 4 mA = 0 mg/acm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must average the test run averages of PM concentrations and PMDS responses to obtain a single pair of data for PM concentration and PMDS response. You may use this pair of data and the zero point to define a linear correlation model for the PMDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must use the average of the test run averages of PM concentrations for extrapolating the alarm set-point. The PM emission concentration used to extrapolate the alarm set-point must not exceed the PM emission standard, however.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Establishing the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance. You must establish the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance as provided by either paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) or paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section. You must periodically revise the alarm set-point as provided by paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Establishing the initial set-point without extrapolation. (1) If you establish the initial alarm set-point without extrapolation, the alarm set-point is the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Establishing the initial set-point by extrapolation. You may extrapolate the particulate matter detector response to establish the alarm set-point under the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures you will use to establish an approximate correlation curve using the three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data (see methods in appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter) and PMDS data from the comprehensive performance test, the data pairs used to establish the correlation curve for the Documentation of Compliance under paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section, and additional data pairs, as warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan,

of your determination of whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS. If so, you must recommend the number of data pairs needed to establish those correlation curves and how the data will be obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the comprehensive performance test may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow the procedures under paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(C)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> You must use a least-squares regression model to correlate PM concentrations to PMDS responses for data pairs. You may assume a linear regression model approximates the relationship between PM concentrations and PMDS responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. The emission concentration used to extrapolate the PMDS response must not exceed the PM emission standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Revising the Notification of Compliance alarm set-point--(A) Revising set-points established without extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must establish a new alarm set-point in the Notification of Compliance following each comprehensive performance test as the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Revising set-points established without extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must establish a new alarm set-point in the Notification of Compliance following each comprehensive performance test as the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Revising set-points established with extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures for periodically revising the alarm set-point, considering the additional data pairs obtained during periodic comprehensive performance tests and data pairs obtained from other tests, such as for quality assurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Quality assurance--(A) Set-points established without extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the average of the PM concentrations demonstrated during the comprehensive performance test. Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Set-points established without extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the average of the PM concentrations demonstrated during the comprehensive performance test. Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Set-points established with extrapolation. If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlated to the alarm set-point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> PMDS are used for compliance assurance only. For a PMDS for which the alarm set-point is established by extrapolation using a correlation curve under paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii)(B), and (c)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, an exceedance of the PMDS response that appears to correlate with a PM concentration that exceeds the PM emission standard is not by itself evidence that the standard has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> PMDS corrective measures requirements. The operating and maintenance plan required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section must include a corrective measures plan that specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a PMDS alarm or malfunction. The corrective measures plan must include, at a minimum, the procedures used to determine and record the time and cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction as well as the corrective measures taken to correct the control device or PMDS malfunction or minimize emissions as specified below. Failure to initiate the corrective measures required by this paragraph is failure to ensure compliance with the emission standards in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds or the PMDS malfunctions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must alleviate the cause of the alarm or the PMDS malfunction by taking the necessary corrective measure(s) which may include shutting down the combustor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Excessive exceedances notification. If you operate the combustor when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point or when the PMDS is malfunctioning more than 5 percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you must submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor, emission control device, or PMDS you are taking to minimize exceedances. To document compliance with this requirement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each alarm and PMDS malfunction, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction and the corrective action taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds and the PMDS malfunctions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If inspection of the emission control device demonstrates that no corrective action is required, then no alarm time is counted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If corrective action to the emission control device is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. Each PMDS malfunction shall also be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.[64 FR 53038, Sept. 30, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 42298, July 10, 2000; 65 FR 67271, Nov. 9, 2000; 66 FR 24272, May 14, 2001; 66 FR 35103, July 3, 2001; 66 FR 63317, Dec. 7, 2001; 67 FR 6813, Feb. 13, 2002; 67 FR 6989, Feb. 14, 2002; 67 FR 77691, Dec. 19, 2002; 70 FR 59541, Oct. 12, 2005; 70 FR 75047, Dec. 19, 2005; 71 FR 20459, Apr. 20, 2006; 71 FR 62393, Oct. 25, 2006; 73 FR 18979, Apr. 8, 2008; 73 FR 64094, Oct. 28, 2008]</p>
