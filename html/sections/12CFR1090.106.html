                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Market-related definitions. As used in this subpart:</p><p class="depth2">Account volume means the number of accounts with respect to which a  nonbank covered person is considered to perform student loan servicing,  calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Number of accounts. A nonbank covered person has at least one  account for each student or prior student with respect to whom the  nonbank covered person performs student loan servicing. If a nonbank  covered person is receiving separate fees for performing student loan  servicing with respect to a given student or prior student, the nonbank  covered person has one account for each stream of fees to which the  person is entitled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time of measurement. The number of accounts is counted as of  December 31 of the prior calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Affiliated companies. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The account volume of a nonbank  covered person is the sum of the number of accounts of that nonbank  covered person and of any affiliated companies of that person.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If two persons become affiliated companies, each person's number  of accounts as of the prior calendar year's December 31 is included in  the total account volume.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If two affiliated companies cease to be affiliated companies,  the number of accounts of each continues to be included in the other's  account volume until the succeeding December 31.</p><p class="depth2">Post-secondary education expenses means any of the expenses that are  included as part of the cost of attendance of a student as defined in 20  U.S.C. 1087ll.</p><p class="depth2">Post-secondary education loan means a loan that is made, insured or  guaranteed under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.  1070 et seq.) or that is extended to a consumer with the expectation  that the funds extended will be used in whole or in part to pay post- secondary education expenses. A loan that is extended in order to  refinance or consolidate a consumer's existing post-secondary education  loans is also a post-secondary education loan. However, no loan under an  open-end credit plan (as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(20))  or loan that is secured by real property is a post-secondary education  loan, regardless of the purpose for the loan.</p><p class="depth2">Student loan servicing means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower or  notification of such payments and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Applying payments to the borrower's account pursuant to the  terms of the post-secondary education loan or of the contract governing  the servicing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During a period when no payment is required on a post-secondary  education loan,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Maintaining account records for the loan and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Communicating with the borrower regarding the loan, on behalf of  the loan's holder; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Interactions with a borrower, including activities to help  prevent default on obligations arising from post-secondary education  loans, conducted to facilitate the activities described in paragraph (i)  or (ii) of this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test to define larger participants. A nonbank covered person  that offers or provides student loan servicing is a larger participant  of the student loan servicing market if the nonbank covered person's  account volume exceeds one million.
