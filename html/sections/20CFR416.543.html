                            <p class="depth0">We apply any underpayment due an individual to reduce any  overpayment to that individual that we determine to exist (see  Sec. 416.558) for a different period, unless we have waived recovery of  the overpayment under the provisions of Secs. 416.550 through 416.556.  Similarly, when an underpaid recipient dies, we first apply any amounts  due the deceased recipient that would be payable to a survivor under  Sec. 416.542(b) against any overpayment to the survivor unless we have  waived recovery of such overpayment under the provisions of  Secs. 416.550 through 416.556.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A disabled child, eligible for payments under title XVI,  and his parent, also an eligible individual receiving payments under  title XVI, were living together. The disabled child dies at a time when  he was underpaid $100. The deceased child's underpaid benefit is payable  to the surviving parent. However, since the parent must repay an SSI  overpayment of $225 on his own record, the $100 underpayment will be  applied to reduce the parent's own overpayment to $125.
