The Federal awarding agency must include the following general Federal award information in each Federal award:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recipient name (which must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier as defined at 2 CFR 25.315);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recipient's unique entity identifier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Federal Award Date (see Sec. 200.39 Federal award date);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Period of Performance Start and End Date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Total Amount of the Federal Award;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Budget Approved by the Federal Awarding Agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Total Approved Cost Sharing or Matching, where applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Federal award project description, (to comply with statutory requirements (e.g., FFATA));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Name of Federal awarding agency and contact information for awarding official,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> CFDA Number and Name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Identification of whether the award is R&D; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged per Sec. 200.414 Indirect (F&A;) costs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General Terms and Conditions (1) Federal awarding agencies must incorporate the following general terms and conditions either in the Federal award or by reference, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Administrative requirements implemented by the Federal awarding agency as specified in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> National policy requirements. These include statutory, executive order, other Presidential directive, or regulatory requirements that apply by specific reference and are not program-specific. See Sec. 200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Federal award must include wording to incorporate, by reference, the applicable set of general terms and conditions. The reference must be to the Web site at which the Federal awarding agency maintains the general terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a non-Federal entity requests a copy of the full text of the general terms and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must provide it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wherever the general terms and conditions are publicly available, the Federal awarding agency must maintain an archive of previous versions of the general terms and conditions, with effective dates, for use by the non-Federal entity, auditors, or others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federal Awarding Agency, Program, or Federal Award Specific Terms and Conditions. The Federal awarding agency may include with each Federal award any terms and conditions necessary to communicate requirements that are in addition to the requirements outlined in the Federal awarding agency's general terms and conditions. Whenever practicable, these specific terms and conditions also should be shared on a public Web site and in notices of funding opportunities (as outlined in Sec. 200.203 Notices of funding opportunities) in addition to being included in a Federal award. See also Sec. 200.206 Standard application requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Federal Award Performance Goals. The Federal awarding agency must include in the Federal award an indication of the timing and scope of expected performance by the non-Federal entity as related to the outcomes intended to be achieved by the program. In some instances (e.g., discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports (to be evaluated in accordance with Federal awarding agency policy). Where appropriate, the Federal award may include specific performance goals, indicators, milestones, or expected outcomes (such as outputs, or services performed or public impacts of any of these) with an expected timeline for accomplishment. Reporting requirements must be clearly articulated such that, where appropriate, performance during the execution of the Federal award has a standard against which non-Federal entity performance can be measured. The Federal awarding agency may include program-specific requirements, as applicable. These requirements should be aligned with agency strategic goals, strategic objectives or performance goals that are relevant to the program. See also OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget Part 6 for definitions of strategic objectives and performance goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Any other information required by the Federal awarding agency.
