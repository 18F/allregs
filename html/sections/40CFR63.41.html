or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> The permitting authority has determined within a period of 5 years prior to the fabrication, erection, or installation of the process or production unit that the existing emission control equipment represented best available control technology (BACT), lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) under 40 CFR part 51 or 52, toxics--best available control technology (T-BACT), or MACT based on State air toxic rules for the category of pollutants which includes those HAP's to be emitted by the process or production unit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> The permitting authority determines that the control of HAP emissions provided by the existing equipment will be equivalent to that level of control currently achieved by other well-controlled similar sources (i.e., equivalent to the level of control that would be provided by a current BACT, LAER, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The permitting authority determines that the percent control efficiency for emissions of HAP from all sources to be controlled by the existing control equipment will be equivalent to the percent control efficiency provided by the control equipment prior to the inclusion of the new process or production unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> The permitting authority has provided notice and an opportunity for public comment concerning its determination that criteria in paragraphs (2)(i), (2)(ii), and (2)(iii) of this definition apply and concerning the continued adequacy of any prior LAER, BATC, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> If any commenter has asserted that a prior LAER, BACT, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination is no longer adequate, the permitting authority has determined that the level of control required by that prior determination remains adequate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vi)</em> Any emission limitations, work practice requirements, or other terms and conditions upon which the above determinations by the permitting authority are applicable requirements under section 504(a) and either have been incorporated into any existing title V permit for the affected facility or will be incorporated into such permit upon issuance.</p><p class="depth0">Control technology means measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques to limit the emission of hazardous air pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the quantity of, or eliminate emissions of, such pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Collect, capture or treat such pollutants when released from a process, stack, storage or fugitive emissions point;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Are design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (including requirements for operator training or certification) as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7412(h); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Are a combination of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Effective date of section 112(g)(2)(B) in a State or local jurisdiction means the effective date specified by the permitting authority at the time the permitting authority adopts a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction or major sources of HAP, or June 29, 1998 whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">Electric utility steam generating unit means any fossil fuel fired combustion unit of more than 25 megawatts that serves a generator that produces electricity for sale. A unit that co-generates steam and electricity and supplies more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 megawatts electric output to any utility power distribution system for sale shall be considered an electric utility steam generating unit.</p><p class="depth0">Greenfield suite means a contiguous area under common control that is an undeveloped site.</p><p class="depth0">List of Source Categories means the Source Category List required by section 112(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources means the emission limitation which is not less stringent that the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the maximum degree of deduction in emissions that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by the constructed or reconstructed major source.</p><p class="depth0">Notice of MACT Approval means a document issued by a permitting authority containing all federally enforceable conditions necessary to enforce the application and operation of MACT or other control technologies such that the MACT emission limitation is met.</p><p class="depth0">Permitting authority means the permitting authority as defined in part 70 or 71 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Process or production unit means any collection of structures and/or equipment, that processes assembles, applies, or otherwise uses material inputs to produce or store an intermediate or final product. A single facility may contain more than one process or production unit.</p><p class="depth0">Reconstruct a major source means the replacement of components at an existing process or production unit that in and of itself emits or has that potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, whenever:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable process or production unit; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> It is technically and economically feasible for the reconstructed major source to meet the applicable maximum achievable control technology emission limitation for new sources established under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Research and development activities means activities conducted at a research or laboratory facility whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where such source is operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for sale or exchange for commercial profit, except in a de minimis manner.</p><p class="depth2">Similar source means a stationary source or process that has comparable emissions and is structurally similar in design and capacity to a constructed or reconstructed major source such that the source could be controlled using the same control technology.
