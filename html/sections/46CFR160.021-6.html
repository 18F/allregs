Whenever a question arises  as to the watertightness of a container, the following test may be made  to determine whether it is satisfactory in this respect. Open the  container, remove the contents, insert colored blotting paper as a  lining, re-close container as tightly as possible by hand (no wrenches  or special tools permitted), submerge container with top about 30 cm (1  ft.) below the surface of the water for two hours, remove container from  water, wipe off excess moisture on outside,   then open the container and examine the blotting paper and entire  interior for evidence of moisture penetration. If any moisture or water  is evidenced, the container is not satisfactory. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.004</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Marking of container. Containers shall be embossed or bear a  brass or equivalent corrosion-resistant nameplate, or otherwise be  suitably and permanently marked, to plainly show in letters not less  than 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) high the following wording: ``HAND RED FLARE  DISTRESS SIGNALS''. No additional marking which might cause confusion as  to the contents shall be permitted. The vessel's name ordinarily is  painted or branded on equipment such as this container, and nothing in  this subpart shall be construed as prohibiting same.</p>
