Additional elements may be published in the applicable grant announcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Executive summary. This summary of the proposal must identify the State entity applying for the grant and the key agency contact information (telephone and fax numbers, mailing address and e-mail address). The applicant must clearly state the amount requested in this section. It should briefly describe the program, including the estimated number of potential beneficiaries in eligible areas, their estimated fuel needs, the projects and activities to be financed through the revolving fund and how the projects and activities will improve the cost effectiveness of fuel procured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicant eligibility. The application must establish that the applicant is a State entity that was in existence as of November 9, 2000, and has the legal authority to enter into a financial assistance relationship with the Federal Government to carry out the grant activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assessment of needs and potential beneficiaries. The application must provide estimates of the number, location and population of potentially eligible areas in the State and their estimated fuel needs and costs. The section must also describe the criteria used to identify eligible areas, including the characteristics that make fuel deliveries by surface transport impossible or impracticable. The description of beneficiary communities should provide a detailed breakdown of the density profile of the area to be served by eligible projects. Indicate to what extent persons in eligible areas live outside of communities of 2,500 persons or more, communities of 5,000 or more or outside of communities of 20,000 or more. All population estimates should be based on Census Bureau data where available. All representations should be supported with exhibits such as maps, summary tables and references to official information sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Project description. The application must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describe the legal structure and staffing of the revolving fund proposal for fuel purchase support.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the objectives of the project, the proposed criteria for establishing project funding eligibility and how the project is to be staffed, managed and financed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe how the potential beneficiaries will be informed of the availability of revolving fund benefits to them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Explain how the proposed revolving fund program will help provide a more cost-effective means of meeting fuel supply needs in eligible areas, encourage the adoption of financially sustainable energy practices, the adequate planning and investment in bulk fuel facility operations and maintenance and cost-effective investments in energy efficiency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the revolving fund program is not yet operational, a proposed implementation schedule and milestones should be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Demonstrated experience. The application shall describe past accomplishments and experiences that are relevant to determine whether the applicant is capable of administering the grant project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Budget. The application must include a pro forma operating budget for

the proposed fund and a description of all funding sources. The level of detail must be sufficient for reviewers to determine that grant funds will be used only for eligible purposes and to determine the extent to which the program is entirely dependent on grant funding or whether it has financial support from the State or other sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Performance measures and project evaluation. The application must provide unambiguous and quantifiable measures that will be used to evaluate the success and cost-effectiveness of the revolving fund in assuring adequate fuel supplies for eligible communities and for assessing the fuel supply projects financed. The grant announcement may establish additional required elements that must be addressed in the narrative proposal of the application package.</p>
