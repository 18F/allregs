                                Sec. 1.614-2  Election to aggregate separate operating mineral interests
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section relate to the  election, under section 614(b) prior to its amendment by section 226(a)  of the Revenue Act of 1964, to aggregate separate operating mineral  interests, and, unless otherwise indicated, all references in this  section to section 614(b) or any paragraph or subparagraph thereof are  references to section 614(b) or a paragraph or subparagraph thereof as  it existed prior to such amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding  sentence, the definitions contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section shall apply both before and after such amendment. All references  in this section to section 614(d) are references to section 614(d) as it  existed prior to its amendment by section 226(b)(3) of the Revenue Act  of 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A taxpayer who owns two or more separate operating mineral  interests, which constitute part or all of an operating unit, may elect  under section 614(b) and this section to form one aggregation of any two  or more of such operating mineral interests and to treat such  aggregation as one property. Any operating mineral interest which the  taxpayer does not elect to include within the aggregation within the  time prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section shall be treated as a  separate property. The aggregation of separate properties which results  from exercising the election shall be considered as one property for all  purposes of subtitle A of the Code. The preceding sentence does not  preclude the use of more than one account under a single method of  computing depreciation or the use of more than one method of computing  depreciation under section 167, if otherwise proper. Any reasonable and  consistently applied method or methods of computing depreciation of the  improvements made with respect to the separate properties aggregated may  be continued in accordance with section 167 and the regulations  thereunder. Operating interests in different minerals which comprise  part or all of the same operating unit may be included in the  aggregation. It is not necessary for purposes of the aggregation that  the separate operating mineral interests be included in a single tract  or parcel of land or in contiguous tracts or parcels of land so long as  such interests are a part of the same operating unit. Under section  614(b), a taxpayer cannot elect to form more than one aggregation of  separate operating mineral interests within one operating unit. For  definitions of operating mineral interest and operating unit see  respectively paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operating mineral interest defined. The term operating mineral  interest means a separate mineral interest as described in section  614(a), in respect of which the costs of production are required to be  taken into account by the taxpayer for purposes of computing the  limitation of 50 percent of the taxable   income from the property in determining the deduction for percentage  depletion computed under section 613, or such costs would be so required  to be taken into account if the mine, well, or other natural deposit  were in the production stage. The term does not include royalty  interests or similar interests, such as production payments or net  profits interests. For the purpose of determining whether a mineral  interest is an operating mineral interest, costs of production do not  include intangible drilling and development costs, exploration  expenditures under section 615, or development expenditures under  section 616. Taxes, such as production taxes, payable by holders of  nonoperating interests are not considered costs of production for this  purpose. A taxpayer may not aggregate operating mineral interests and  nonoperating mineral interests such as royalty interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Operating unit defined. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term operating unit refers to  the operating mineral interests which are operated together for the  purpose of producing minerals. An operating unit of a particular  taxpayer must be determined on the basis of his own operations. It is  recognized that operating units may not be uniform in the various  natural resources industries or in any one of the natural resources  industries, such as coal, oil and gas, and the like. As to a particular  taxpayer, business reasons may require the formation of operating units  that vary in size and content. The term operating unit refers to a  producing unit, and not to an administrative or sales organization.  Among the factors which indicate that mineral interests are operated  together as a unit are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Common field or operating personnel,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Common supply and maintenance facilities,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Common processing or treatment plants, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Common storage facilities   However, operating mineral interests which are geographically widespread  may not be treated as parts of the same operating unit merely because a  single set of accounting records, a single executive organization, or a  single sales force is maintained by the taxpayer with respect to such  interests, or merely because the products of such interests are  processed at the same treatment plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If aggregated, an undeveloped operating mineral interest shall  be aggregated only with those interests with which it will be operated  as a unit when it reaches the production stage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> While a taxpayer may operate an operating mineral interest  through an agent, a coowner may aggregate only his operating mineral  interests that are actually operated as a unit. For example, if A owned  and actually operated the entire working interest in lease X and also  owned an undivided fraction of lease Y in which B owned the remaining  interest and which B actually operated as a unit with lease Z, A may not  aggregate his interest in lease X with his undivided interest in lease  Y, since they are not actually operated as a unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The determination of the taxpayer as to what constitutes an  operating unit is to be accepted unless there is a clear and convincing  basis for a change in such determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Manner and scope of election--(1) Election; when made. (i)  Except as provided in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the  election under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat  a mineral interest as part of an aggregation shall be made not later  than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax  return (including extensions thereof), for whichever of the following  taxable years is the later:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and  ending after August 16, 1954, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> except in the case of oil and gas wells. If an  expenditure has been made in respect of a separate operating mineral  interest, it is immaterial whether or not any proven deposit has been  discovered with respect to such interest when such expenditure has been  made. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer A is producing from an oil and gas horizon and in  1958 he drills for the purpose of locating a deeper horizon which will  be operated in the same operating unit as the upper producing horizon.  At the end of the taxable year 1958 he has expended $50,000 drilling for  the purpose of locating a deeper horizon although at such time there is  no assurance that such a horizon will be found. If taxpayer A desires to  aggregate the deeper horizon, if found, with the upper horizon under  section 614(b), he must elect to do so in his return for 1958. If the  election to aggregate the upper and lower horizons as one property is  made, the drilling expenditures with respect to the prospective lower  horizon must be taken into account along with the income and expenses  with respect to the upper producing horizon in computing the depletion  allowance on the aggregated property.   However, where expenditures for development of, or production from, a  particular mineral deposit result in the discovery of another mineral  deposit, the election with respect to such other deposit shall be made  for the taxable year in which it is discovered and not for the taxable  year in which the expenditures were first made which resulted in such  discovery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except in the case of oil and gas wells, if a taxpayer fails to  make an election under section 614(b) to aggregate a particular  operating mineral interest on or before the time prescribed for the  making of such election, such interest will be treated as if an election  had been made under section 614(b) to treat it as a separate property  and it cannot be included in any aggregation within the operating unit  of which it is a part unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the  Commissioner. However, where the taxpayer owns more than one property  within an operating unit, but has elected to treat such properties  separately and one or more additional operating mineral interests are  subsequently acquired, any one or more of the latter may be aggregated  with one of the existing separate properties within the operating unit  but not with more than one of them since they cannot be validly  aggregated with each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of oil and gas wells, if the taxpayer fails to  make an election under section 614(b) with respect to a particular  operating mineral interest on or before the time prescribed for the  making of such election, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have treated  such interest under the provisions of section 614(d). See section 614(d)  and Sec. 1.614-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of section 614(b), the acquisition of an option to  acquire an economic interest in minerals in place does not constitute  the acquisition of a mineral interest. Thus, a taxpayer who makes  expenditures for the exploration of minerals on a particular tract under  an option to acquire an economic interest in minerals in place is not  required to make an election with respect to such interest at that time.  Furthermore, the election need not be made in the taxable year in which  payments are made for the acquisition of a lease, such as the payment of  a bonus, unless exploratory, development, or operation expenditures are  made thereafter with respect to the property in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election; how made. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The election under section 614(b) must  be made by a statement attached to the income tax return of the taxpayer  for the first taxable year for which the election is made. This  statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is making an aggregation of  separate operating mineral interests within an operating unit under  section 614(b) and shall contain a description of the aggregation and  describe the operating mineral interests within the operating unit which  are to be treated as separate properties apart from the aggregation. A  general description, accompanied by maps appropriately marked, which  accurately circumscribes the scope of the aggregation and identifies the  properties which   are to be treated separately will be sufficient. The statement shall  also contain a description of the operating unit in sufficient detail to  show that the aggregated operating mineral interests are properly within  a single operating unit. See paragraph (c) of this section. The taxpayer  shall maintain adequate records and maps in support of the above  information. In the event expenditures are first made on an operating  mineral interest within an operating unit after an election with respect  to the aggregation of interests in that operating unit has been made,  the taxpayer shall furnish only information describing such operating  mineral interest, its location in the operating unit, and whether it is  to be included within the aggregation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the taxpayer made or did not make the election under section  614(b) with respect to a particular operating mineral interest and the  last day prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions  of time therefor) on which the election was required to be made falls on  or before May 1, 1961, consent is hereby given to the taxpayer to make  or change the election not later than May 1, 1961. Any such election or  change of such election shall be effective with respect to the earliest  taxable year to which the election is applicable in respect of which  assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the  case may be, resulting from such election or change is not prevented by  any law or rule of law on the date such election or change is made. An  election or change of election made pursuant to this subdivision shall  be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which it is  effective and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent to a  different treatment is obtained from the Commissioner. (See, however,  paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the termination and  nonapplicability of the election under section 614(b) except in the case  of oil and gas wells.) Such election or change shall be made in the form  of a statement setting forth the nature of the election or change,  including information substantially the same as that required by  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and shall be accompanied by an  amended return or returns if necessary or, if appropriate, a claim for  refund or credit. The appropriate documents must be filed on or before  May 1, 1961 with the district director for the district in which the  original return was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election; when effective. If a taxpayer has elected to aggregate  an operating mineral interest, the date on which the aggregation becomes  effective is the earliest date within the taxable year affected, on  which the taxpayer incurred any expenditure for exploration,  development, or operation of such interest. The application of this rule  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1953, a taxpayer owned and operated mineral interests  Nos. 1, 2, and 3. All three interests form one operating unit. The  taxpayer, who files his return on a calendar year basis, continued to  own and operate these interests during the year 1954, and in his return  for that year, filed on April 15, 1955, elected to aggregate these three  interests. As the result of this election, the aggregation was effective  for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code as of January 1, 1954.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that, on March 1, 1955, the taxpayer described in  example 1 acquired operating mineral interest No. 4 which was also a  part of the operating unit composed of operating mineral interests Nos.  1, 2, and 3, that he made his first expenditure for exploration with  respect to operating mineral interest No. 4 on September 1, 1955, and  that, in his return filed on April 15, 1956, he elected to aggregate  operating mineral interest No. 4 with the aggregation consisting of Nos.  1, 2, and 3. As the result of that election, operating mineral interest  No. 4 became a part of the aggregation for all purposes of subtitle of  the Code on September 1, 1955.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election; binding effect. A valid election made under section  614(b) and this section shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the  taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless  consent to make a change is obtained from the Commissioner. However, see  paragraph (e) of this section for rules with respect to the termination  of the election under section 614(b) except in the case of oil and gas  wells. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the  basis of a separate or an aggregated property in the hands of the  transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the  transferor, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.614-6. A taxpayer can neither   include within the aggregation a separate operating mineral interest  which he had previously elected to treat separately, nor exclude from  the aggregation a separate operating mineral interest previously  included therein unless consent to do so is obtained from the  Commissioner. A change in tax consequences alone is not sufficient to  obtain consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest.  However, consent may be appropriate where, for example, there has been a  substantial change in the taxpayer's operations so that a major part of  an aggregation becomes a part of another operating unit. Applications  for consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a  statement indicating the reason or reasons for the change and furnishing  the information required under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (2) of  this paragraph, unless such information has been previously filed and is  current.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Invalid aggregations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In addition to  aggregations which are invalid under section 614(b) because of the  failure to make timely elections, aggregations may be invalid under such  section in situations which may be divided into two general categories.  The first category involves basic aggregations which were timely but  otherwise initially invalid. The second category involves invalid  additions of operating mineral interests to basic aggregations which  additions became subject to the election in years subsequent to the year  in which the initial basic aggregation or aggregations were formed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Invalid basic aggregations. The term invalid basic aggregations  refers to those aggregations which are initially invalid. Generally,  such basic aggregations will be invalid because more than one  aggregation has been formed within an operating unit or because  operating mineral interests in two or more operating units have been  improperly aggregated. For any year in which an invalid basic  aggregation exists, each operating mineral interest included in such  aggregation shall be treated for all purposes as a separate property  unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such  interest in a different manner. Consent will be granted in appropriate  cases as, for example, where the taxpayer demonstrates that he  inadvertently formed an invalid basic aggregation. The provisions of  this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1953, taxpayer A owned six operating mineral  interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, and he continued to own and  operate such interests during 1954. He acquired no other operating  mineral interests during such year. All six of these operating mineral  interests form one operating unit. Assume that A elected under section  614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 into  one aggregation and Nos. 4 through 6 into another aggregation. Since A  has formed two aggregations in one operating unit, they are invalid  basic aggregations. Therefore, interests Nos. 1 through 6 must be  treated as separate properties for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years  unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any of such  interests in a different manner.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 and assume also  that, in his return for 1954, A correctly elected to aggregate all six  operating mineral interests into one aggregation under section 614(b).  Assume further that all these operating mineral interests continued to  be in one operating unit for the years 1954, 1955, and 1956 but that,  because of changes in the facts and circumstances of A's operations, in  1957 operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 became a part of one  operating unit and Nos. 4, 5, and 6 became a part of another operating  unit. Notwithstanding the change in operations, the election made by A  shall continue to be binding unless consent to change such election is  obtained from the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Invalid additions. The term additions refers to the additions  that a taxpayer makes by electing to aggregate an operating mineral  interest with an aggregation formed in a previous year. Such additions  will be invalid where the taxpayer either elected to aggregate an  operating mineral interest with an invalid basic aggregation or elected  to aggregate an operating mineral interest which is part of one  operating unit with an aggregation of operating mineral interests which  is a part of another operating unit. An operating mineral interest which  is invalidly added to either a valid basic   aggregation or to an invalid basic aggregation shall be considered as a  separate property unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to  treat such interest in a different manner. The following are examples of  invalid additions:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1953, taxpayer A owned six operating mineral interests  designated No. 1 through No. 6 and he continued to own and operate such  interests during 1954. He acquired no other operating mineral interests  during that year. Nos. 1 through 3 formed one operating unit and Nos. 4  through 6 formed another operating unit. In his return for 1954, A  incorrectly elected to aggregate all six operating mineral interests  into one aggregation under section 614(b). In 1955, A acquired and  commenced development of operating mineral interest No. 7 which is  correctly a part of the operating unit of which operating mineral  interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are a part. A elected under section 614(b),  for the year 1955, to aggregate operating mineral interest No. 7 with  the invalid basic aggregation composed of Nos. 1 through 6. Since  operating mineral interest No. 7 was aggregated with an invalid basic  aggregation, it is an invalid addition and must be treated as a separate  property unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat it in  a different manner.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1953, taxpayer A owned nine operating mineral  interests designated No. 1 through No. 9. During 1954, he continued to  own and operate such interests and acquired no other operating mineral  interest. Interests No. 1 through No. 3 form one operating unit, Nos. 4  through 6 form another operating unit, and Nos. 7 through 9 form a third  operating unit. For the year 1954, A elected under section 614(b) to  aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 into one  aggregation, to treat Nos. 5 and 6 as separate properties, and to  aggregate Nos. 7, 8, and 9 into another aggregation. Assume that in 1955  A acquired and commenced development of operating mineral interest No.  10 which was a part of the operating unit composed of Nos. 1, 2, and 3.  Assume further that he elected under section 614(b) to aggregate No. 10  with the aggregation composed of Nos. 7, 8, and 9. This would be an  invalid addition to a valid basic aggregation since operating mineral  interest No. 10 was not properly a part of the operating unit formed by  Nos. 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, interest No. 10 must be treated as a  separate property for 1955 and all subsequent taxable years unless  consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat it in a different  manner. However, the valid basic aggregation composed of interests Nos.  7 through 9 is not affected by the invalid addition of interest No. 10.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that A  elected under section 614(b) in 1955 to aggregate No. 10 with the  aggregation of Nos. 1 through 4. This would also be an invalid addition  because the aggregation composed of Nos. 1 through 4 is an invalid basic  aggregation since operating mineral interest No. 4 is not a part of the  operating unit consisting of Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, interest No.  10 must be treated as a separate property for 1955 and all subsequent  taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat  such interest in a different manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Termination of election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1963, in the case of oil and gas wells. In the case of oil  and gas wells, the election provided for under section 614(b) and  paragraph (a) of this section to form an aggregation of separate  operating mineral interests shall not apply with respect to any taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1963. In addition, if a taxpayer  treated certain separate operating mineral interests in a single tract  or parcel of land as separate rather than as an aggregation and decides  to continue such treatment for taxable years beginning after December  31, 1963, he must make an appropriate election under section 614(b) as  amended by the Revenue Act of 1964. See Sec. 1.614-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, in the case of  mines. Except in the case of oil and gas wells, the election provided  for under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to form an  aggregation of separate operating mineral interests shall not apply with  respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. Thus, if  a taxpayer makes a binding election under section 614(b) to form an  aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within an operating  unit for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, he must make a  new election for the first taxable year beginning after December 31,  1957, under section 614(c) within the time prescribed in Sec. 1.614-3 if  he wishes to aggregate any separate operating mineral interests within  such operating unit. A new election must be made under section 614(c)  notwithstanding the fact that the aggregation formed under section  614(b) would constitute a valid aggregation under section 614(c).  Failure to   make such an election within the time prescribed shall constitute an  election to treat each separate operating mineral interest within the  operating unit as a separate property for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(B)</em> and paragraph (f)(2) of  Sec. 1.614-3 which is applicable to any separate operating mineral  interest within the same operating unit. The provisions of this  subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1953, taxpayer A owned six separate operating mineral  interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit.  Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 comprise a mine, and  operating mineral interest No. 6 represents one mineral deposit in a  single tract of land which is being extracted by means of two mines.  Taxpayer A previously made a binding election under section 614(b) to  aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 and to treat  operating mineral interest No. 6 as a separate property. Under section  614(c)(2) and (3)(B) taxpayer A makes an election which is applicable  for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years to treat  operating mineral interest No. 6 as two separate operating mineral  interests. Therefore, the previous election of taxpayer A to aggregate  operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 under section 614(b) does  not apply. Unless taxpayer A also makes an election to aggregate  operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 as one property under  section 614(c)(1) and (3)(B) within the time prescribed in paragraph  (f)(2) of Sec. 1.614-3, he shall be deemed to have made an election to  treat each of such interests as a separate property for 1954 and all  subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1953, taxpayer B owned six separate operating mineral  interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit.  Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 comprise a mine and Nos. 4  through 6 comprise a second mine. Taxpayer B previously made a binding  election under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests  Nos. 1 through 8 and to treat Nos. 4 through 6 as separate properties.  Under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) taxpayer B makes an election which  is applicable for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years  to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 4 through 6 as one  property. The previous election of the taxpayer under section 614(b) to  aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 does not apply  even though such aggregation would constitute a valid aggregation if  formed under section 614(c)(1). Therefore, if taxpayer B wishes to  continue to treat operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 as one  property, he must also make an election to do so under section 614(c)  (1) and (3)(B) within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of  Sec. 1.614-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(B)</em>, an election to  aggregate under section 614(b) does not apply for any taxable year for  which such election was made, the bases of the separate operating  mineral interests included in the aggregation formed under section  614(b) shall be determined without regard to the election under section  614(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Alternative treatment of separate operating mineral interests in  the case of oil and gas wells. For rules relating to an alternative  treatment of separate operating mineral interests in the case of oil and  gas wells, see Sec. 1.614-4.
