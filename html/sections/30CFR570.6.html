In the event such communications or consultations result in a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint, the complainant and all persons cited in the complaint shall notify the Regional Director in writing of their agreement to such resolution. If either the complainant or the person(s) alleged to have wrongfully discriminated fail to provide such written notice within a reasonable period of time, the Regional Director must proceed in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR part 550, subpart N.</p>
