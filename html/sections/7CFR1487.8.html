                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reimbursement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the implementation of a project for  which the CCC has agreed to provide funding, a participant may submit  claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses to the extent that the CCC  has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must  be approved in writing by the FAS before any reimbursable expenses  associated with the change can be incurred. A participant will be  reimbursed after the CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is  complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90  calendar days following the expiration or termination date of the  program agreement. For program agreements which extend beyond twelve  months, all claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90  calendar days following the next anniversary of the effective date of  the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participants shall maintain complete records of all program  expenditures, identified by TASC agreement number, program year, country  or region, activity number and cost category. Such records shall be  accompanied by original documentation which supports the expenditure and  shall be made available to the FAS upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participants shall maintain all records and documents relating  to TASC projects, including the original documentation which supports  reimbursement claims, for a period of 3 calendar years following the  expiration or termination date of the program agreement. Such records  and documents will be subject to verification by FAS and shall be made  available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.  FAS may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by  acceptable documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is  disallowed after payment already has been made, the participant shall  return the overpayment amount or the disallowed amount to the CCC within  30 days after realizing the overpayment or receiving notification of the  overpayment or disallowed amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advances. Participants may request advances of funds, not to  exceed 85 percent of the funding approved in any given program year. All  advanced funds must be either fully expended or the balance returned by  check made payable to the CCC no later than the 90th calendar day  following the date of disbursement of the advance to the participant.  Upon the expenditure of advance funds, participants must submit  reimbursement claims to offset the advance charged to them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest. Participants shall deposit and maintain advanced funds  in insured, interest-bearing accounts. Interest earned on outstanding  advances must be returned by check made payable to the CCC at the time  the advance is either fully expended or itself returned.
