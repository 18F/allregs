                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section lists the requirements for spaces (other  than propelling machinery spaces under Sec. 69.121) which, though  included in calculating gross tonnage (i.e., are not exempt under Sec.  69.117), are deducted from gross tonnage in deriving net tonnage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A deductible space must be used exclusively for,  and be reasonable in size for, its intended purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a space is larger than necessary for the safe and efficient  operation of deductible equipment, only the space occupied by the  equipment plus a two foot maximum working space on each side of the  equipment, if available, is deductible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Space specified in this section may be located anywhere within  the vessel, unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Anchor gear. A space below the line of the uppermost complete  deck occupied by the anchor gear, capstan, windlass, and chain locker is  deductible. A fore peak used exclusively as chain locker is measured by  the method prescribed under Sec. 69.117(g)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Boatswain's stores. A space containing oils, blocks, hawsers,  rigging, deck gear, or other boatswain's stores for daily use is  deductible. The maximum deduction allowed for vessels less than 100  gross tons is one ton and, for vessels 100 gross tons or over, is one  percent of the gross tonnage, not to exceed 100 tons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Chart room. A space for keeping charts and nautical instruments  and for plotting the vessel's course is deductible. For a combined  wheelhouse and chart room, that part not exempted as wheelhouse under  Sec. 69.117(b)(9) is deductible. For small vessels in which the only  space for a chart room is in a cabin or saloon, one half the space not  to exceed 1.5 tons is deductible as chart room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Donkey engine and boiler. Donkey engine and boiler space is  deductible when connected with the main (non-cargo) pumps of the vessel,  except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the space is within the engine room or within the casing  above the engine room and if the donkey engine is an auxiliary to the  main propelling machinery, the space is an engine room deduction under  Sec. 69.121(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the space is above the line of the uppermost complete deck  and if the donkey engine is not an auxiliary to the main propelling  machinery, the space is exempt under Sec. 69.117(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Spaces for the exclusive use of officers or crew. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  following spaces, regardless of their location (unless otherwise noted),  are deductible if not used by passengers:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sleeping rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bathrooms with a bath tub or shower but without a water closet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Water closets below the line of the uppermost complete deck  serving more than one person, with or without a bath tub or shower.  Water closets, regardless of location, that serve only one person or  that are accessible only through a stateroom or bedroom serving one  person are considered as part of the space they serve and are deductible  only if that space is deductible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Clothes drying rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Drinking water filtration or distilling plant below the line of  the uppermost complete deck.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Hospitals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Mess rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Office of the chief engineer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Oil skin lockers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Pantries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Recreation rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Smoking rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Galleys below the line of the uppermost complete deck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shops for engineers, carpenters, plumbers, or butchers and  offices for clerks, pursers, or postmasters are not deductible, wherever  located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Master's cabin.

Spaces for steering gear below the line of the  uppermost complete deck are deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Generators. Spaces for generators below the line of the  uppermost complete deck are deductible regardless of what space the  generators serve. These spaces may include other equipment necessary for  the generator's operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Pump room. Spaces below the line of the uppermost complete deck  containing pumps that are not capable of handling cargo and that are not  fuel oil transfer pumps considered part of the propelling machinery  under Sec. 69.121(b)(2)(v) are deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Sail stowage. A space for stowing sails on a vessel propelled  only by sails is deductible up to two and one-half percent of the  vessel's gross tonnage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Waste material space. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A tank or collection space, regardless  of location, used for the carriage or collection of sewage, garbage,  galley waste, trash, slop-oil mixture, tank cleaning residue, bilge  residue, or other waste material generated aboard the vessel is  deductible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Space below the line of the uppermost complete deck used  exclusively to separate, clarify, purify, or otherwise process waste  material generated aboard the vessel is deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Passageways. A passageway or companionway is deductible--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it serves deductible spaces only; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it serves deductible spaces and is also the sole means of  access to one of the following non-deductible spaces:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lockers of less than two tons each, containing medicine, linen,  mops, or other items for the free use of the crew.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A ship's office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Spare rooms (not exceeding two) used by a pilot, customs  officer, reserve engineer, or employee or agent of the vessel's owner or  operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Markings for deductible spaces. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each space deducted under  this section   must be marked with the words ``Certified ------'' (inserting the space  designation, such as ``Seaman'', ``Generator'', Office of Chief  Engineer'', ``Hospital'', or ``Anchor Gear''). If a deductible space  berths more than one crew member, the marking must indicate the number  of crew members berthed, such as ``Certified ------ Seamen'' (inserting  the number of crew).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The abbreviations ``Cert.'' for ``certified'' and ``W.C.'' for  ``water closet'' may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The markings must be in Roman letters and Arabic numerals at  least \1/2\ inch in height, must be painted in a light color on a dark  background, must be embossed, center-punched, carved, or permanently cut  in a bulkhead or metal plate, and must be placed in a legible location  over a doorway on the inside of the space. A metal plate, if used, must  be permanently fastened in place by welding, riveting, lock screws, or a  Coast Guard-approved bonding agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Method for measuring deductible spaces. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A rectangular space  must be measured by taking the product of its length, breadth, and  height.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A space with curved sides on or above the tonnage deck is  measured according to Sec. 69.109.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Space less than 15 feet in length may be measured by any  practical method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Spaces below the tonnage deck exceeding 15 feet in length and  bounded by a curved surface conforming to the side of the vessel must be  measured by the formula used for measuring the superstructure under  Sec. 69.113.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The height of a space located on a platform in the hull must be  measured from the top of the bottom hull frames, if the platform is used  only to form a flat surface at the bottom of the space, if the platform  is not more than one foot above the top of the bottom frames, and if the  space below the platform is not usable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The height of a space is measured through any ceiling, paneling,  false overhead, or other covering, to the space's structural boundary,  unless the space enclosed by the covering is available for a non- deductible use.
