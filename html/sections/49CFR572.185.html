The dummy's torso spine backplate is vertical within  2 degrees and the midsagittal plane of thorax is  positioned perpendicular to the direction of the plane of motion of the  impactor at contact with the thorax. The non-struck side arm is oriented  vertically, pointing downward. The dummy's legs are horizontal and  symmetrical about the midsagittal plane with the distance between the  innermost point on the opposite ankle at 100 5 mm;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The impactor is the same as defined in Sec. 572.189(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the  thorax its longitudinal axis is within 0.5 degrees  of horizontal and perpendicular 0.5 degrees to the  midsagittal plane of the dummy and the centerpoint of the impactor's  face is within 5 mm of the impact point on the dummy's middle rib shown  in Figure U4 in appendix A to this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The impactor impacts the dummy's thorax at 5.5 m/s 0.1 m/s.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Time zero is defined in Sec. 572.189(k).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance Criteria. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual rib modules shall  conform to the following range of deflections:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Upper rib not less than 34 mm and not greater than 41 mm;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Middle rib not less than 37 mm and not greater than 45 mm;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Lower rib not less than 37 mm and not greater than 44 mm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The impactor force shall be computed as the product of the  impact probe acceleration and its mass.
