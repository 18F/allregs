                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The decision as to access authorization and/or employment  clearance is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after  consideration of all the information, favorable or unfavorable, relevant  to whether the granting of access authorization and/or employment  clearance would not endanger the common defense and security and would  be clearly consistent with the national interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The criteria in Sec. 10.11 set forth a number of the types of  derogatory information used to assist in making determinations of  eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. These  criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of  derogatory information which create a question as to the individual's  eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. While  there must necessarily be adherence to such criteria, the NRC is not  limited to them, nor precluded from exercising its judgment that  information or facts in a case under its cognizance are derogatory  although at variance with, or outside the scope of, the stated  categories. These criteria are subject to continuing review and may be  revised from time to time as experience and circumstances may make  desirable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the reports of investigation of an individual contain  information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or more of  the items in the criteria, such information shall be regarded as  derogatory and shall create a question as to the individual's  eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. A  question concerning the eligibility of an individual for access  authorization and/or employment clearance shall be resolved in  accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 10.20 et seq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued  eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or employment  clearance, the following principles shall be applied by the Director,  Division of Facilities and Security, Hearing Examiners, and the NRC  Personnel Security Review Panel:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or  more of the items in the criteria shall be the basis for recommending  denial or revocation of access authorization and/or employment clearance  unless evidence to support faith in the individual's reliability and  trust-worthiness is affirmatively shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When deemed material to the deliberations, the extent of the  activity, conduct, or condition, the period in which they occurred or  existed, the length of time which has since elapsed, and the attitude  and convictions of the individual shall be considered in determining  whether the recommendation will be adverse or favorable.
