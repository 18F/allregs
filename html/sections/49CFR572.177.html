One-third  (\1/3\) of the weight of the suspension cables and their attachments to  the impact probe is included in the calculation of mass, and such  components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test  probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric  with the longitudinal axis, is at least 25.4 mm (1.0 in) long, and has a  flat, continuous, and non-deformable 121 0.25 mm  (4.76 0.01 in) diameter face with a maximum edge  radius of 12.7 mm (0.5 in). The probe's end opposite to the impact face  has provisions for mounting of an accelerometer with its sensitive axis  collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. No concentric  portions of the impact probe may exceed the diameter of the impact face.  The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000  Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in the PADI  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 572.170).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test probe for knee impacts is of rigid metallic  construction, concentric in shape, and symmetric about its longitudinal  axis.
