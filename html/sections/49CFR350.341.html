                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State may exempt a CMV from all or part of its laws or regulations applicable to intrastate commerce, provided that neither the GVW, GVWR, GCW, nor GCWR of the vehicle equals or exceeds 11,801 kg (26,001 lbs.). However, a State may not exempt a CMV from such laws or regulations if the vehicle:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transports hazardous materials requiring a placard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is designed or used to transport 16 or more people, including the driver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce may not grant exemptions based upon the type of transportation being performed (e.g., for-hire, private, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A State may retain those exemptions from its motor carrier safety laws and regulations that were in effect before April, 1988, are still in effect, and apply to specific industries operating in intrastate commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce must not include exemptions based upon the distance a motor carrier or driver operates from the work reporting location. This prohibition does not apply to those exemptions already contained in the FMCSRs nor to the extension of the mileage radius exemption contained in 49 CFR 395.1(e) from 100 to 150 miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hours of service--State hours-of-service limitations applied to intrastate transportation may vary to the extent of allowing the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A 12-hour driving limit, provided driving a CMV after having been on duty more than 16 hours is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Driving prohibitions for drivers who have been on duty 70 hours in 7 consecutive days or 80 hours in 8 consecutive days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Age of CMV driver--All CMV drivers must be at least 18 years of age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grandfather clauses--States may provide grandfather clauses in their rules and regulations if such exemptions are uniform or in substantial harmony with the FMCSRs and provide an orderly transition to full regulatory adoption at a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Driver qualifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intrastate drivers who do not meet the physical qualification standards in 49 CFR 391.41 may continue to be qualified to operate a CMV in intrastate commerce if the following three conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The driver was qualified under existing State law or regulation at the time the State adopted physical qualification standards compatible with the Federal standards in 49 CFR 391.41.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The otherwise non-qualifying medical or physical condition has not substantially worsened.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No other non-qualifying medical or physical condition has developed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State may adopt or continue programs granting variances to intrastate drivers with medical or physical conditions that would otherwise be non-qualifying under the State's equivalent of 49 CFR 391.41 if the variances are based upon sound medical judgment combined with appropriate performance standards ensuring no adverse effect on safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State may decide not to adopt laws and regulations that implement a registry of medical examiners trained and qualified to apply physical qualification standards or variances continued in effect or adopted by the State under this paragraph that apply to
