                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision under Sec. 89.511 (b), (c), (d), or (f) to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to Sec. 89.511 (a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of the decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer must simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, at her or his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a

hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The manufacturer's request for a public hearing must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under Sec. 89.511(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in appendix A of this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under Sec. 89.511(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the public during Agency business hours.
