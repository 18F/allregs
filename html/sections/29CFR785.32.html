If the above criteria are met the time spent in such related supplemental training shall not be counted as hours worked unless the written agreement specifically provides that it is hours worked. The mere payment or agreement to pay for time spent in related instruction does not

constitute an agreement that such time is hours worked.</p><p class="depth2">Traveltime</p>
