                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director, FAPD, shall investigate complaints of  discrimination that allege a violation of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sec. 16 of the Federal  Energy Administration Act of 1974, as amended, or Sec. 401 of the Energy  Reorganization Act of 1974;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, (reserved in this  part);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended,  (reserved in this part);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> This part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Civil rights provisions of statutes administered pursuant to the  DOE Organization Act, Pub. L. 95-91.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No complaint will be investigated if it is received by an  appropriate Departmental official more than 180 days after the date of  the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by  the Director, FAPD, for good cause shown. Where a complaint is accepted  for investigation, the Director, FAPD, will initiate a DOE  investigation. The Director, FAPD, who is responsible for the  investigation, shall notify the complainant, in writing, if the  complaint has been accepted or rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director, FAPD, or his/her designee shall conduct  investigations of complaints as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 35 days of receipt of a complaint, the Director, FAPD,  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> determine whether DOE has jurisdiction under paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If jurisdiction is not found, wherever possible, refer the  complaint to the Federal agency with such jurisdiction and advise the  complainant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If jurisdiction is found, notify the recipient alleged to be  discriminating of receipt of the complaint; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Initiate the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The investigation will ordinarily be initiated by a letter  requesting data pertinent to the complaint and advising the recipient  of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the complaint and, with the written consent of the  complainant, the identity of the complainant. The identity of the  complainant may be revealed by the Director, FAPD, OEO, without the  complainant's written consent if the Director, FAPD, OEO, determines  that such action is necessary for resolution of the complaint;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The program or activities affected by the complaint;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The opportunity to make, at any time prior to receipt of DOE's  findings, a documentary submission responding to, rebutting, or denying  the allegations made in the complaint; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The schedule under which the complaint will be investigated and  a determination of compliance made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 90 days of initiating the investigation, the Director,  FAPD, shall advise the recipient, in writing of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Preliminary findings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where appropriate, recommendations for achieving voluntary  compliance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The opportunity to request DOE to engage in voluntary  compliance negotiations prior to the Director's final determination of  compliance or noncompliance. The Director or the Director's designee  shall notify the Assistant Attorney General and the recipient of any  matter where recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance are  made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, within 45 days of the recipient's notification under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Director's (FAPD) recommendations  for compliance are not met, or voluntary compliance is not secured, or  the preliminary findings are not shown to be false, the matter will be  forwarded to the Director, OEO, for a determination of compliance or  noncompliance. The determination is to be made no later than 60 days  after the recipient has been notified of the preliminary findings. If  the Director makes a determination of noncompliance, the Department  shall institute actions specified in subpart H.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the Director makes a formal determination of  noncompliance,   the recipient and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately  advised, in writing, of the determination and of the fact that the  recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into voluntary  compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10  days, the Director shall institute proceedings under subpart H. All  agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and  signed by the Director, OEO, and an official who has authority to  legally bind the recipient. The complainant shall also be notified of  any action taken including the closing of the complaint or achievement  of voluntary compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the complainant or party other than the Attorney General has  filed suit in Federal or State court alleging the same discrimination  alleged in a complaint to DOE, and if during DOE's investigation, the  trial of that suit would be in progress, DOE will consult with the  Assistant Attorney General and court records to determine the need to  continue or suspend the investigation and will monitor the litigation  through the court docket and contacts with the complainant. Upon receipt  of notice that the court has made a finding of discrimination against a  recipient that would constitute a violation of this part, the DOE may  institute administrative proceedings as specified in subpart H after DOE  has advised the recipient, in writing, of an opportunity to request  voluntary compliance under this section. All agreements to come into  voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by the Director and  an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The time limits listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of  this section shall be appropriately adjusted where DOE requests another  Federal agency to act on the complaint. DOE is to monitor the progress  of the matter through liaison with the other agency. Where the request  to act does not result in timely resolution of the matter, DOE is to  institute appropriate proceedings as required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or  other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against  any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or  privilege secured by the laws implemented in this part or because the  complainant has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated  in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this  subpart. The identity of complainants is to be kept confidential except  as determined by the Director, FAPD, to be necessary to carry out the  purpose of this subpart, including investigations, hearings, or judicial  proceedings arising thereunder.</p>
