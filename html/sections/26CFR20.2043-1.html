                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The transfers, trusts, interests, rights or powers  enumerated and described in sections 2035 through 2038 and section 2041  are not subject to the Federal estate tax if made, created, exercised,  or relinquished in a transaction which constituted a bona fide sale for  an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. To  constitute a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in  money or money's worth, the transfer must have been made in good faith,  and the price must have been an adequate and full equivalent reducible  to a money value. If the price was less than such a consideration, only  the excess of the fair market value of the property (as of the  applicable valuation date) over the price received by the decedent is  included in ascertaining the value of his gross estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Marital rights and support obligations. For purposes of chapter  11, a relinquishment or promised relinquishment or dower, curtesy, or of  a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other  marital rights in the decedent's property or estate, is not to any  extent a consideration in ``money or money's worth.''</p>
