Where insulation of any type is used in spaces  where flammable and combustible liquids or vapors are present, e.g.,  machinery spaces and paint lockers, a vapor barrier which covers the  insulation must be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Paint. Nitrocellulose or other highly flammable or noxious fume  producing paints or lacquers must not be used on the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Mattresses.
