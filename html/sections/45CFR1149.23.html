The reviewing official may respond to  the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the ALJ determines that you have demonstrated extraordinary  circumstances excusing your failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ  will withdraw the initial decision and grant you an opportunity to  answer the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A decision by the ALJ to deny your motion to reopen a case is  not subject to review or reconsideration.</p>
