                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Responses within 20 working days. OSTP will exercise all  reasonable efforts to acknowledge, grant, partially grant, or deny a  request for records within 20 working days after receiving a perfected  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> include, but are not  limited to, requests that require OSTP to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Search for and collect the requested records from off-site  storage facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous  amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single  request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consult, with all practicable speed, with another agency having  a substantial interest in the determination of the request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Perform searches of records of former employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Two-track processing. To ensure the most equitable treatment  possible for all requesters, OSTP will process requests on a first-in,  first-out basis, using a two-track processing system based upon the  estimated time it will take to process the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Simple requests. The first track is for requests of simple to  moderate complexity that are expected to be completed within 20 working  days. A requester whose request does not qualify as a simple request may  be given an opportunity to limit the scope of his or her request in  order to qualify for faster processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complex requests. The second track is for requests involving  ``unusual circumstances,'' as described in paragraph (b) of this  section, that are expected to take more than 20 working days to  complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Expedited requests: OSTP may take  requests out of order and expedite the processing of a request upon  receipt of a written statement that clearly demonstrates a compelling  need for expedited processing. Requesters must provide detailed  explanations to support their expedited requests. For purposes of  determining expedited processing, the term compelling need means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis  could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of any individual; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That a request is made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information, and the person establishes that there is an  urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal  Government activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person requesting expedited processing must include a  statement certifying that the compelling need provided is true to the  best of the requester's knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OSTP may grant or deny a request for expedited processing as a  matter of agency discretion. A determination of whether to provide  expedited processing shall be made, and notice of the determination  shall be provided to the person making the request, within 10 working  days after receipt of the perfected request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Content of denial. When OSTP denies a request for records,  either in whole or in part, the written notice of the denial shall state  the reason for denial, and cite the applicable statutory exemption(s),  unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s)  under which the request was denied, and notify the requester of the  right to appeal the determination as specified in Sec. 2402.7. The  requester's failure to make advance payment or to give a satisfactory  assurance of full payment required under Sec. 2402.8 may be treated as a  denial of the request and appealed under Sec. 2402.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Identifying responsive records. In determining which records are  responsive to a request, OSTP ordinarily will include only records in  its possession as of the date the component begins its search for them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Consultations and referrals. When OSTP receives a request for a  record in its possession, it shall determine whether another agency of  the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is  exempt from disclosure under FOIA and, if so, whether it should be  disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If the receiving  component determines that it is best able to process the record in  response to the request, then it shall do so. If the receiving component  determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Respond to the request regarding that record after consulting  with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with  any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding  that record to the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it,  or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency  is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record  will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.  OSTP shall notify the FOIA requester in writing that a referral of  records has been made, provide the name of the agency to which the  referral was directed, and include that agency's FOIA contact  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Redactions. For redactions within disclosed records, OSTP shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indicate the FOIA exemption under which a redaction is made,  unless including that exemption would harm an interest protected by the  exemption; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indicate, if technically feasible and reasonable, the amount of  information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made  at the place in the record where the deletion is made.</p>
