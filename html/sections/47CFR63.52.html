The petition shall contain specific  allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in  interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie  inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. Such  allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may  be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal  knowledge thereof.
