Drugs, seeds, plants,  nursery stock, and other articles required to be inspected by the  Department of Agriculture must be inspected by a representative of the  Department of Agriculture to ascertain whether they comply with the  requirements of the law and regulations of that Department. If found not  to comply with such requirements, they shall be immediately destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pesticides and devices. Pesticides and devices intended for  trapping, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest or any other form  of plant or animal life (other than man or other than bacteria, virus,  or other microorganism on or in living man or other living animals)  shall be inspected by a representative of the Environmental Protection  Agency to ascertain whether they comply with the requirements of the law  and regulations of that agency. If found not to comply with such  requirements, they shall be immediately destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Explosives, dangerous articles, fruit, and perishables.  Unclaimed explosives and other dangerous articles, and fruit and other  perishable articles shall be sold after 3-days' public notice. When it  is probable that entry will be made at an early date for unclaimed  perishable merchandise, the port director may hold the merchandise for a  reasonable time in a bonded cold-storage warehouse if one is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Articles liable to depreciation. Other unclaimed merchandise  shall be sold at public auction upon public notice of not less than 6 or  more than 10 days, as the port director may determine, if in his opinion  such merchandise will depreciate and sell for an amount insufficient to  pay the duties, storage, and other charges if allowed to remain in  general order for 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tobacco and tobacco products. Tobacco articles and tobacco  materials as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5702(j) and (k), may be sold for  domestic consumption only   if they will bring an amount sufficient to pay the expenses of sale as  well as the internal revenue tax. If these articles cannot be sold for  domestic consumption in accordance with the foregoing conditions, they  shall be destroyed unless they can be advantageously sold for export  from continuous Customs custody or unless the Commissioner of Customs  has authorized other disposition to be made under the law. These  articles may be sold for domestic consumption even though the proceeds  of sale will not cover the duties due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Distilled spirits, wines, and malt beverages. All unclaimed and  abandoned distilled spirits, wines, and malt beverages may be sold for  domestic consumption if they will bring an amount sufficient to pay the  internal revenue tax. If they cannot be sold for domestic consumption in  accordance with the foregoing condition, they shall be destroyed unless  they can be advantageously sold for export from continuous Customs  custody or unless the Commissioner of Customs has authorized other  disposition to be made under the law. The sale must be conducted in  accordance with the alcoholic beverage laws of the state in which the  sale is held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other merchandise subject to internal revenue taxes. All other  unclaimed and abandoned merchandise subject to internal revenue taxes  may be sold for domestic consumption if it will bring an amount  sufficient to pay the internal revenue tax. If, in the opinion of the  port director, it is insufficient in value to justify its sale, the  merchandise shall be destroyed, unless it can be advantageously sold for  export from continuous Customs custody or unless the Commissioner of  Customs has authorized other disposition to be made under the law. These  articles may be sold for domestic consumption even though the proceeds  of sale will not cover the duties due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Unclaimed merchandise remaining on dock. Unclaimed merchandise  remaining on the dock which, in the opinion of the port director, will  not sell for enough to pay the cost of cartage and storage shall be sold  at public auction upon public notice of not less than 6 or more than 10  days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Chemical substances, mixtures, and articles containing chemical  substances or mixtures. Chemical substances, mixtures, and articles  containing a chemical substance or mixture, as these items are defined  in section 3, Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA'') and section 12.120  of this chapter, shall be inspected by a representative of the  Environmental Protection Agency to ascertain whether they comply with  TSCA and the regulations and orders issued thereunder.
