If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the

cancellation will be confirmed, in writing, within 20 days of oral notification of the cancellation. Any person whose compliance agreement has been cancelled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully cancelled. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact.

In a non-protected area, appeal shall be made to the Administrator. The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the hearing.
