                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of this section. This section clarifies the obligation  imposed by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,  (sections 701(j), 703 and 717) to accommodate the religious practices of  employees and prospective employees. This section does not address other  obligations under title VII not to discriminate on grounds of religion,  nor other provisions of title VII. This section is not intended to limit  any additional obligations to accommodate religious practices which may  exist pursuant to constitutional, or other statutory provisions; neither  is it intended to provide guidance for statutes which require  accommodation on bases other than religion such as section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The legal principles which have been  developed with respect to discrimination prohibited by title VII on the  bases of race, color, sex, and national origin also apply to religious  discrimination in all circumstances other than where an accommodation is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duty to accommodate. (1) Section 701(j) makes it an unlawful  employment practice under section 703(a)(1) for an employer to fail to  reasonably accommodate the religious practices of an employee or  prospective employee, unless the employer demonstrates that  accommodation would result in undue hardship on the conduct of its  business. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 74  (1977).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 701(j) in conjunction with section 703(c), imposes an  obligation on a labor organization to reasonably accommodate the  religious practices of an employee or prospective employee, unless the  labor organization demonstrates that accommodation would result in undue  hardship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 1605.2 is primarily directed to obligations of employers  or labor organizations, which are the entities covered by title VII that  will most often be required to make an accommodation. However, the  principles of Sec. 1605.2 also apply when an accommodation can be  required of other entities covered by title VII, such as employment  agencies (section 703(b)) or joint labor-management committees  controlling apprecticeship or other training or retraining (section  703(d)). (See, for example, Sec. 1605.3(a) ``Scheduling of Tests or  Other Selection Procedures.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable accommodation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After an employee or prospective  employee notifies the employer or labor organization of his or her need  for a religious accommodation, the employer or labor organization has an  obligation to reasonably accommodate the individual's religious  practices. A refusal to accommodate is justified only when an employer  or labor organization can demonstrate that an undue hardship would in  fact result from each available alternative method of accommodation. A  mere assumption that many more people, with the same religious practices  as the person being accommodated, may also need accommodation is not  evidence of undue hardship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When there is more than one method of accommodation available  which would not cause undue hardship, the Commission will determine  whether the accommodation offered is reasonable by examining:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The alternatives for accommodation considered by the employer or  labor organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The alternatives for accommodation, if any, actually offered to  the individual requiring accommodation. Some alternatives for  accommodating religious practices might disadvantage the individual with  respect to his or her employment opportunites, such as compensation,  terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Therefore, when there is  more than one means of accommodation which would not cause undue  hardship, the employer or labor organization must offer the alternative  which least disadvantages the individual with respect to his or her  employment opportunities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternatives for accommodating religious practices. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Employees and prospective employees most frequently request an  accommodation because their religious practices conflict with their work  schedules. The following subsections are some means of accommodating the  conflict between work schedules and religious practices which the  Commission believes that employers and labor organizations should  consider as part of the obligation to accommodate and which the  Commission will consider in investigating a charge. These are not  intended to be all-inclusive. There are often other alternatives which  would reasonably accommodate an individual's religious practices when  they conflict with a work schedule. There are also employment practices  besides work scheduling which may conflict with religious practices and  cause an individual to request an accommodation. See, for example, the  Commission's finding number (3) from its Hearings on Religious  Discrimination, in appendix A to Sec. Sec. 1605.2 and 1605.3. The  principles expressed in these Guidelines apply as well to such requests  for accommodation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Voluntary Substitutes and ``Swaps''.</p><p class="depth0">Reasonable accommodation without undue hardship is generally  possible where a voluntary substitute with substantially similar  qualifications is available. One means of substitution is the voluntary  swap. In a number of cases, the securing of a substitute has been left  entirely up to the individual seeking the accommodation. The Commission  believes that the obligation to accommodate requires that employers and  labor organizations facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute  with substantially similar qualifications. Some means of doing this  which employers and labor organizations should consider are: to  publicize policies regarding accommodation and voluntary substitution;  to promote an atmosphere in which such substitutions are   favorably regarded; to provide a central file, bulletin board or other  means for matching voluntary substitutes with positions for which  substitutes are needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flexible Scheduling.</p><p class="depth0">One means of providing reasonable accommodation for the religious  practices of employees or prospective employees which employers and  labor organizations should consider is the creation of a flexible work  schedule for individuals requesting accommodation.</p><p class="depth0">The following list is an example of areas in which flexibility might  be introduced: flexible arrival and departure times; floating or  optional holidays; flexible work breaks; use of lunch time in exchange  for early departure; staggered work hours; and permitting an employee to  make up time lost due to the observance of religious practices. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ On September 29, 1978, Congress enacted such a provision for the  accommodation of Federal employees' religious practices. See Pub. L. 95- 390, 5 U.S.C. 5550a ``Compensatory Time Off for Religious Observances.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lateral Transfer and Change of Job Assignments.</p><p class="depth0">When an employee cannot be accommodated either as to his or her  entire job or an assignment within the job, employers and labor  organizations should consider whether or not it is possible to change  the job assignment or give the employee a lateral transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment of Dues to a Labor Organization.</p><p class="depth0">Some collective bargaining agreements include a provision that each  employee must join the labor organization or pay the labor organization  a sum equivalent to dues. When an employee's religious practices to not  permit compliance with such a provision, the labor organization should  accommodate the employee by not requiring the employee to join the  organization and by permitting him or her to donate a sum equivalent to  dues to a charitable organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Undue hardship. (1) Cost. An employer may assert undue hardship  to justify a refusal to accommodate an employee's need to be absent from  his or her scheduled duty hours if the employer can demonstrate that the  accommodation would require ``more than a de minimis cost''. \4\ The  Commission will determine what constitutes ``more than a de minimis  cost'' with due regard given to the identifiable cost in relation to the  size and operating cost of the employer, and the number of individuals  who will in fact need a particular accommodation. In general, the  Commission interprets this phrase as it was used in the Hardison  decision to mean that costs similar to the regular payment of premium  wages of substitutes, which was at issue in Hardison, would constitute  undue hardship. However, the Commission will presume that the infrequent  payment of premium wages for a substitute or the payment of premium  wages while a more permanent accommodation is being sought are costs  which an employer can be required to bear as a means of providing a  reasonable accommodation. Further, the Commission will presume that  generally, the payment of administrative costs necessary for providing  the accommodation will not constitute more than a de minimis cost.  Administrative costs, for example, include those costs involved in  rearranging schedules and recording substitutions for payroll purposes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Hardison, supra, 432 U.S. at 84. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seniority Rights. Undue hardship would also be shown where a  variance from a bona fide seniority system is necessary in order to  accommodate an employee's religious practices when doing so would deny  another employee his or her job or shift preference guaranteed by that  system. Hardison, supra, 432 U.S. at 80. Arrangements for voluntary  substitutes and swaps (see paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) do not  constitute an undue hardship to the extent the arrangements do not  violate a bona fide seniority system. Nothing in the Statute or these  Guidelines precludes an employer and a union from including arrangements  for voluntary substitutes and swaps as part of a collective bargaining  agreement.</p>
