Your good faith use of a service agent is not a defense in an enforcement action initiated by a DOT agency in which your alleged noncompliance with this part or a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation may have resulted from the service agent's conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As an employer, you must not permit a service agent to act as your DER.</p>
