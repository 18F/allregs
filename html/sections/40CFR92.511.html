                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remanufacturers of locomotives or locomotive engines shall audit  the remanufacture of locomotives covered by its certificate(s) of  conformity for proper components, component settings and component  installations on randomly chosen locomotives in an engine family. Such  audits shall be conducted in compliance with the requirements of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The remanufacturer must ensure that all emission related  components are properly installed on the locomotive or locomotive  engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The remanufacturer must ensure that all emission related  components are set to the proper specification as indicated in the  remanufacture instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remanufacturers are allowed to submit audits performed by the  owners or operators of the locomotives, provided the audits are  performed in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required initial sample size (i.e., the sample size if no  failures occur) for each remanufacturer is five percent of the  remanufacturer's annual sales per model year per installer, with a  maximum number of ten per engine family per installer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The locomotives audited shall be randomly selected after the  remanufacture is complete. The Administrator may allow the locomotives  to be selected prior to the completion of the remanufacture, where such  preselection would not have the potential to affect the manner in which  the   locomotive was remanufactured (e.g., where the installer is not aware of  the selection prior to the completion of the remanufacture).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine may  accumulate no more than 10,000 miles prior to an audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A failed remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine is one  on which any remanufacture components are found to be improperly  installed, improperly adjusted or incorrectly used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine fails an  audit, then the remanufacturer must audit two additional locomotives or  locomotive engines from the next ten remanufactured in that engine  family by that installer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An engine family is determined to have failed an audit, if at  any time during the model year, the remanufacturer determines that the  three locomotives audited are found to have had any improperly  installed, improperly adjusted or incorrectly used components. The  remanufacturer must notify EPA within 2 working days of a determination  of an engine family audit failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Within 45 calendar days of the end of each quarter, each  remanufacturer must submit to the Administrator a report which includes  the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of the remanufacturer's audit  facilities which were utilized to conduct auditing reported pursuant to  this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total production and sample size for each engine family;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicable standards and/or FELs against which each engine  family was audited;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each audit conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the audit locomotive or locomotive engine,  including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration and engine family identification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make, build date, and remanufacturer date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engine identification number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other information the Administrator may request relevant to  the determination whether the new locomotives or locomotive engines  being manufactured or remanufactured by the remanufacturer do in fact  conform with the regulations in this part with respect to which the  certificate of conformity was issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each failed locomotive or locomotive engine as defined in  paragraph (d) of this section, a description of the remedy as required  by Sec. 92.512(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following signed statement and endorsement by an authorized  representative of the remanufacturer:</p><p class="depth3">This report is submitted pursuant to Sections 213 and 208 of the  Clean Air Act. This production line auditing program was conducted in  complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part  92. No emission-related changes to production processes or quality  control procedures for the engine family audited have been made during  this production line auditing program that affect locomotives or  locomotive engines from the production line. All data and information  reported herein is, to the best of (Company Name) knowledge, true and  accurate. I am aware of the penalties associated with violations of the  Clean Air Act and the regulations thereunder. (Authorized Company  Representative.)
