                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Assistant Administrator, in consultation with Regional  Administrators and Science Center Directors, will make an annual  determination identifying which fisheries the agency intends to observe.  This determination will be based on the extent to which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fishery operates in the same waters and at the same time as  sea turtles are present;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fishery operates at the same time or prior to elevated sea  turtle strandings; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fishery uses a gear or technique that is known or likely to  result in incidental take of sea turtles based on documented or reported  takes in the same or similar fisheries; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> NMFS intends to monitor the fishery and anticipates that it will  have the funds to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Assistant Administrator shall publish the proposed  determination and any final determination in the Federal Register.  Public comment will be sought at the time of publication of the proposed  determination. In addition, a written notification of the final  determination will be sent to the address specified for the vessel in  either the NMFS or state fishing permit application, or to the address  specified for registration or documentation purposes, or such  notification will be otherwise served on the owners or operator of the  vessel. Additionally, NMFS will notify state agencies and provide  notification through publication in local newspapers, radio broadcasts,  and any other means as appropriate. The proposed and any final  determinations will include, to the extent practicable, information on  fishing sector, targeted gear type, target fishery, temporal and  geographic scope of coverage, or other information, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fisheries listed on the most recent annual Marine Mammal  Protection Act List of Fisheries in any given year, in accordance with  16 U.S.C. 1387, will serve as the comprehensive set of commercial  fisheries to be considered for inclusion in the annual determination.  Recreational fisheries may also be included in the annual determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Publication of the proposed and final determinations should be  coordinated to the extent possible with the annual Marine Mammal  Protection Act List of Fisheries process as specified at 50 CFR 229.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inclusion of a fishery in a proposed or final determination does  not constitute a conclusion by NMFS that those participating in the  fishery are illegally taking sea turtles.</p>
