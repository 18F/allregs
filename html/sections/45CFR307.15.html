hardware, and other needs and the resources available or expected to be available to meet the requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The APD must contain a proposed budget and schedule of life-cycle milestones relative to the size, complexity and cost of the project which at a minimum address requirements analysis, program design, procurement and project management; and, a description of estimated expenditures by category and amount for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Items that are eligible for funding at the enhanced matching rate, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Items related to developing and operating the system that are eligible for Federal funding at the applicable matching rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The APD must contain an implementation plan and backup procedures to handle possible failures in system planning, design, development, installation or enhancement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> These backup procedures must include provision for independent validation and verification (IV&V;) analysis of a State's system development effort in the case of States:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That do not have in place a statewide automated child support enforcement system that meets the requirements of the FSA of 1988;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> States which fail to meet a critical milestone, as identified in their APDs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> States which fail to timely and completely submit APD updates;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> States whose APD indicates the need for a total system redesign;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> States developing systems under waivers pursuant to section 452(d)(3) of the Social Security Act; or,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> States whose system development efforts we determine are at risk of failure, significant delay, or significant cost overrun.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Independent validation and verification efforts must be conducted by an entity that is independent from the State (unless the State receives an exception from OCSE) and the entity selected must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Develop a project workplan.
