Any paper strip used to seal the bottle shall be of solid color and without design or printing, except that a border or a design, formed entirely of the legend ``not genuine--for display purposes only'' is permissible. Records shall be kept of the receipt and disposition of such bottles, showing the names and addresses of consignees, dates of shipment, and size, quantity, and description of bottles.</p>
