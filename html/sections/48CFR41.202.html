                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to executing a utility service contract, the contracting  officer shall comply with parts 6 and 7 and 41.201 (d) and (e). In  accordance with parts 6 and 7, agencies shall conduct market surveys and  perform acquisition planning in order to promote and provide for full  and open competition provided that the contracting officer determines  that any resultant contract would not be inconsistent with applicable  state law governing the provision of electric utility services. If  competition for an entire utility service is not available, the market  survey may be used to determine the availability of competitive sources  for certain portions of the requirement. The scope of the term ``entire  utility service'' includes the provision of the utility service  capacity, energy, water, sewage, transportation, standby or back-up  service, transmission and/or distribution service, quality assurance,  system reliability, system operation and maintenance, metering, and  billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In performing a market survey (see 7.101), the contracting  officer shall consider, in addition to alternative competitive sources,  use of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> GSA areawide contracts (see 41.204);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Separate contracts (see 41.205); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interagency agreements (see 41.206).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a utility supplier refuses to execute a tendered contract  as outlined in 41.201(b), the agency shall obtain a written definite and  final refusal signed by a corporate officer or other responsible  official of the supplier (or if unobtainable, document any unwritten  refusal), and transmit this document, along with statements of the  reasons for the refusal and the record of negotiations, to GSA at the  address specified at 41.301(a). Unless urgent and compelling  circumstances exist, the contracting officer shall notify GSA prior to  acquiring utility services without executing a tendered contract. After  such notification, the agency may proceed with the acquisition and pay  for the utility service under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1501(a)(8)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By issuing a purchase order in accordance with 13.302; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By ordering the necessary utility service and paying for it upon  the presentation of an invoice, provided that a determination is  approved by the head of the contracting activity that a written contract  cannot be obtained and that the issuance of a purchase order is not  feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When obtaining service without a bilateral written contract, the  contracting officer shall establish a utility history file on each  acquisition of utility service provided by a contractor. This utility  history file shall contain, in addition to applicable documents in  4.803, the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unsigned, tendered contract and any related letter of  transmittal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reasons stated by the utility supplier for not executing the  tendered contract, the record of negotiations, and a written definite  and final refusal by a corporate officer or other responsible official  of the supplier (or if unobtainable, documentation of unwritten  refusal).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Services to be furnished and the estimated annual cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Historical record of any applicable connection charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Historical record of any applicable ongoing capital credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A copy of the applicable rate schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Government obtains utility service pursuant to paragraph  (c) of this section, the contracting officer   shall, on an annual basis beginning from the date of final refusal, take  action to execute a bilateral written contract. The contracting officer  shall document the utility history file with the efforts made and the  agency shall notify GSA, in writing, if the utility continues to refuse  to execute a bilateral contract.
