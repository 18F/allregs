The party must submit the petition to the Hearing Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The District Commander may file comments in opposition to the petition. If comments are filed, a copy is provided the party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A petition to reopen is considered by the Hearing Officer unless an appeal has been filed, in which case the petition is considered by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The decision on the petition is decided on the basis of the record, the petition, and the comments in opposition, if any. The petition is granted only when newly found evidence is described which has a direct and material bearing on the issues and when a valid explanation is provided as to why the evidence was not and could not have been, in the exercise of due diligence, produced at the hearing. The decision is rendered in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Following a denial of a petition to reopen, the party is given 30 days to file an appeal if one has not already been filed, or to amend an appeal which has already been filed.
