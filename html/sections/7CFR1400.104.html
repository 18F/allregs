                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any change in a farming operation that would increase the number  of persons or legal entities to which the provisions of this part apply  must be bona fide and substantive. If bona fide, the following will be  considered to be a substantive change in the farming operation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The addition of a family member to a farming operation in  accordance with Sec. 1400.208, except that such an addition will not  affect the status of any other person or legal entity that is added to  the farming operation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to a landowner only, a change from a cash rent to a  share rent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An increase through the acquisition of base acres not previously  involved in the farming operation of at least 20 percent or more in the  total base acres involved in the farming operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of payment limitations, such an increase in base  acres will be considered an applicable bona fide and substantive change  for the increase of only one person or legal entity to the farming  operation, unless;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A representative of the State FSA office determines, based on  the magnitude and complexity of the change represented, the increase in  base acres supports additional persons or legal entities to the farming  operation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A change in ownership by sale or gift of equipment from a person  or legal entity previously engaged in a farming operation to a person or  legal entity that has not been involved in such operation. The sale or  gift of equipment will be considered to be bona fide and substantive  only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transferred amount of such equipment is commensurate with  the new person's or legal entity's share of the farming operation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sale or gift of the equipment was based on the equipment's  fair market value,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The former owner of the equipment has no direct or indirect  control over such equipment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transaction was not financed by the former owner, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Preference was not given to the former owner to re-purchase the  equipment at a later date; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A change in ownership by sale or gift of land from a person or  legal entity who previously has been engaged in a farming operation to a  person or legal entity that has not been involved in such operation. The  sale or gift of land will be considered to be bona fide and substantive  only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transferred amount of such land is commensurate with the new  person's or legal entity's share of the farming operation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sale or gift of land was based on the land's fair market  value,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The former owner of the land has no direct or indirect control  over such land,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transaction was not financed by the former owner, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Preference was not given to the former owner to re-purchase the  land at a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section are  met, the increase in persons or legal entities in the farming operation  will not be recognized for payment limitation purposes and the  additional persons or legal entities are not eligible for program  payment identified in Sec. 1400.1 otherwise resulting from the farming  operation.
