                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pooling. Two units of Source Plasma from the same donor may be  pooled if such units are collected during one plasmapheresis procedure:  Provided, That the pooling is done by a procedure that does not  introduce a risk of contamination of the red blood cells and, for plasma  intended for injectable products, gives maximum assurance of a sterile  container of plasma.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pooling of plasma from two or more donors is not permitted  in the manufacture of Source Plasma intended for manufacturing into  injectable products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pooling of plasma from two or more donors by the  manufacturer of Source Plasma intended for manufacturing into  noninjectable products is permitted: Provided, That the plasma from two  or more donors is pooled after the plasma has been removed from the red  blood cells, and after the red blood cell containers are sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Storage. Immediately after filling, plasma intended for  manufacturing into injectable products shall be stored at a temperature  not warmer than -20 [deg]C, except for plasma collected as provided in  Sec. 640.74. Plasma intended for manufacturing into noninjectable  products may be stored at temperatures appropriate for the intended use  of the final product, provided these temperatures are included in the  Source Plasma license application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inspection. Source Plasma intended for manufacturing into  injectable products shall be inspected for evidence of thawing at the  time of issuance, except that inspection of individual plasma containers  need not be made if the records of continuous monitoring of the storage  temperature establish that the temperature remained at -20 [deg]C or  colder. If there is evidence that the storage temperature has not been  maintained at -20 [deg]C or colder, the plasma may be relabeled and  issued as provided in Sec. 640.76(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Samples. If samples are provided, they shall meet the following  standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to filling, all samples shall be marked or identified so  as to relate them directly to the donor of that unit of plasma.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All samples shall be filled at the time the final product is  prepared by the person who prepares the final product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All samples shall be representative of the contents of the final  product or be collected from the donor at the time of filling the  collection container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All samples shall be collected in a manner that does not  contaminate the contents of the final container.
