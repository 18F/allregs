                                Sec. 64.1601  Delivery requirements and privacy restrictions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delivery. Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Telecommunications carriers and providers of interconnected  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, in originating interstate  or intrastate traffic on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or  originating interstate or intrastate traffic that is destined for the  PSTN (collectively ``PSTN Traffic''), are required to transmit for all  PSTN Traffic the telephone number received from or assigned to or  otherwise associated with the calling party to the next provider in the  path from the originating provider to the terminating provider. This  provision applies regardless of the voice call signaling and  transmission technology used by the carrier or VoIP provider. Entities  subject to this provision that use Signaling System 7 (SS7) are required  to transmit the calling party number (CPN) associated with all PSTN  Traffic in the SS7 ISUP (ISDN User Part) CPN field to interconnecting  providers, and are required to transmit the calling party's charge  number (CN) in the SS7 ISUP CN field to interconnecting providers for  any PSTN Traffic where CN differs from CPN. Entities subject to this  provision who use multi-frequency (MF) signaling are required to  transmit CPN, or CN if it differs from CPN, associated with all PSTN  Traffic in the MF signaling automatic numbering information (ANI) field.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intermediate providers within an interstate or intrastate call  path that originates and/or terminates on the PSTN must pass unaltered  to subsequent providers in the call path signaling information  identifying the telephone number, or billing number, if different, of  the calling party that is received with a call. This requirement applies  to SS7 information including but not limited to CPN and CN, and also  applies to MF signaling information or other signaling information  intermediate providers receive with a call. This requirement also  applies to VoIP signaling messages, such as calling party and charge  information identifiers contained in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)  header fields, and to equivalent identifying information as used in  other VoIP signaling technologies, regardless of the voice call  signaling and transmission technology used by the carrier or VoIP  provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Privacy. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section,  originating carriers using Signaling System 7 and offering or  subscribing to any service based on Signaling System 7 functionality  will recognize *67 dialed as the first three digits of a call (or 1167  for rotary or pulse dialing phones) as a caller's request that the CPN  not be passed on an interstate call. Such carriers providing line  blocking services will recognize *82 as a caller's request that the CPN  be passed on an interstate call. No common carrier subscribing to or  offering any service that delivers CPN may override the privacy  indicator associated with an interstate call. Carriers must arrange  their CPN-based services, and billing practices, in such a manner that  when a caller requests that the CPN not be passed, a carrier may not  reveal that caller's number or name, nor may the carrier use the number  or name to allow the called party to contact the calling party. The  terminating carrier must act in accordance with the privacy indicator  unless the call is made to a called party that subscribes to an ANI or  charge number based service and the call is paid for by the called  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charges. No common carrier subscribing to or offering any  service that delivers calling party number may</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Impose on the calling party charges associated with per call  blocking of the calling party's telephone number, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impose charges upon connecting carriers for the delivery of the  calling   party number parameter or its associated privacy indicator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions. Section 64.1601(a) and (b) shall not apply when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A call originates from a payphone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A local exchange carrier with Signaling System 7 capability does  not have the software to provide *67 or *82 functionalities. Such  carriers are prohibited from passing CPN.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Private Branch Exchange or Centrex system does not pass end  user CPN. Centrex systems that rely on *6 or *8 for a function other  than CPN blocking or unblocking, respectively, are also exempt if they  employ alternative means of blocking or unblocking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CPN delivery--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is used solely in connection with calls within the same limited  system, including (but not limited to) a Centrex system, virtual private  network, or Private Branch Exchange;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is used on a public agency's emergency telephone line or in  conjunction with 911 emergency services, or on any entity's emergency  assistance poison control telephone line; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is provided in connection with legally authorized call tracing  or trapping procedures specifically requested by a law enforcement  agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any person or entity that engages in telemarketing, as defined  in section 64.1200(f)(10) must transmit caller identification  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, caller identification  information must include either CPN or ANI, and, when available by the  telemarketer's carrier, the name of the telemarketer. It shall not be a  violation of this paragraph to substitute (for the name and phone number  used in, or billed for, making the call) the name of the seller on  behalf of which the telemarketing call is placed and the seller's  customer service telephone number. The telephone number so provided must  permit any individual to make a do-not-call request during regular  business hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person or entity that engages in telemarketing is prohibited  from blocking the transmission of caller identification information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not required to comply  with this paragraph.
