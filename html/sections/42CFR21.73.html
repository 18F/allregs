                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services  to withhold allotments from pay and allowances of commissioned officers  on active duty in the Service to make involuntary allotments from pay  and allowances as payment of child, or child and spousal, support  payments when the officer has failed to make periodic payments under a  support order in a total amount equal to the support payable for two  months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by  notice from an authorized person to the designated official of the  Department. Such notice shall specify the name and address of the payee  to whom the allotment is payable. The amount of the allotment shall be  the amount necessary to comply with the support order including amounts  for arrearages as well as for current support. However the amount of the  allotment, when added to any other amounts withheld from the officer's  pay pursuant to a support order, shall not exceed the limits for  involuntary allotments from pay as prescribed in section 303 (b) and (c)  of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1673. An allotment  under this Subpart shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from  any authorized person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the above, no action shall be taken to withhold  an allotment from the pay and allowances of any officer until such  officer has had an opportunity to consult with a legal officer of the  Department to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect  to the officer's support obligation and his or her failure to make  payments. The Department shall exercise continuing good faith efforts to  arrange such a consultation, but must begin to withhold allotments on  the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed since notice of  an opportunity to consult was sent to the officer.</p>
