                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When an employee transfers between Federal agencies, all allowable  expenses must be paid from the funds of the agency that the employee is  transferring to. However, in the case of a reduction in force or  transfer of function, an agreement may be made between the agencies  concerned as to what relocation allowances will be paid by either agency  or split between them. This should include the payment of expenses for  the extended storage of the employee's household goods when assigned to  an isolated permanent duty station within CONUS or a transfer to, from,  or between foreign countries.</p>
