                                Sec. 158.2070  Biochemical pesticides product performance data
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Product performance data must be developed for all biochemical  pesticides. However, the Agency typically does not require applicants to  submit such efficacy data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to  control public health pests, such as pest microorganisms infectious to  man in any area of the inanimate environment or a claim to control  vertebrates (including but not limited to: rodents, birds, bats, canids,  and skunks) or invertebrates (including but not limited to: mosquitoes  and ticks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans.  However, each registrant must ensure through testing that his products  are efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and  commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right  to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of efficacy data for any  pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.</p>
