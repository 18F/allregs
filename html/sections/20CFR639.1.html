                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of WARN. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining  Notification Act (WARN or the Act) provides protection to workers, their  families and communities by requiring employers to provide notification  60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs. Advance  notice provides workers and their families some transition time to  adjust to the prospective loss of employment, to seek and obtain  alternative jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill training or  retraining that will allow these workers to successfully compete in the  job market. WARN also provides for notice to State dislocated worker  units so that dislocated worker assistance can be promptly provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of these regulations. These regulations establish basic  definitions and rules for giving notice, implementing the provisions of  WARN. The Department's objective is to establish clear principles and  broad guidelines which can be applied in specific circumstances.  However, the Department recognizes that Federal rulemaking cannot  address the multitude of industry and company-specific situations in  which advance notice will be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice encouraged where not required. Section 7 of the Act  states:  It is the sense of Congress that an employer who is not required to  comply with the notice requirements of section 3 should, to the extent  possible, provide notice to its employees about a proposal to close a  plant or permanently reduce its workforce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> WARN enforcement. Enforcement of WARN will be through the  courts, as provided in section 5 of the statute. Employees, their  representatives and units of local government may initiate civil actions  against employers believed to be in violation of Sec. 3 of the Act. The  Department of Labor has no legal standing in any enforcement action and,  therefore, will not be in a position to issue advisory opinions of  specific cases. The Department will provide assistance in understanding  these regulations and may revise them from time to time as may be  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice in ambiguous situations. It is civically desirable and it  would appear to be good business practice for an employer to provide  advance notice to its workers or unions, local government and the State  when terminating a significant number of employees. In practical terms,  there are some questions and ambiguities of interpretation inherent in  the application of WARN to business practices in the market economy that  cannot be addressed in these regulations. It is therefore prudent for  employers to weigh the desirability of advance notice against the  possibility of expensive and time-consuming litigation to resolve  disputes where notice has not been given. The Department encourages  employers to give notice in all circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Coordination with job placement and retraining programs. The  Department, through these regulations and through   the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program (TAA) and Economic Dislocation  and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act (EDWAA) regulations, encourages  maximum coordination of the actions and activities of these programs to  assure that the negative impact of dislocation on workers is lessened to  the extent possible. By providing for notice to the State dislocated  worker unit, WARN notice begins the process of assisting workers who  will be dislocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> WARN not to supersede other laws and contracts. The provisions  of WARN do not supersede any laws or collective bargaining agreements  that provide for additional notice or additional rights and remedies. If  such law or agreement provides for a longer notice period, WARN notice  shall run concurrently with that additional notice period. Collective  bargaining agreements may be used to clarify or amplify the terms and  conditions of WARN, but may not reduce WARN rights.</p>
