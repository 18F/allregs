The request must be in writing, include facts and justification to support the waiver, and be submitted to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FTA will consider a request for a waiver from a potential bidder, offeror,

or supplier only if the waiver is being sought under Sec. 661.7 (f) or (g) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator will issue a written determination setting forth the reasons for granting or denying the exception request.
