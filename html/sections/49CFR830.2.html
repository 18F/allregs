                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part the following words or phrases are defined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">Aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation  of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the  aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have  disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or  in which the aircraft receives substantial damage. For purposes of this  part, the definition of ``aircraft accident'' includes ``unmanned  aircraft accident,'' as defined herein.</p><p class="depth0">Civil aircraft means any aircraft other than a public aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Fatal injury means any injury which results in death within 30 days  of the accident.</p><p class="depth0">Incident means an occurrence other than an accident, associated with  the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety  of operations.</p><p class="depth0">Operator means any person who causes or authorizes the operation of  an aircraft, such as the owner, lessee, or bailee of an aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Public aircraft means an aircraft used only for the United States  Government, or an aircraft owned and operated (except for commercial  purposes) or exclusively leased for at least 90 continuous days by a  government other than the United States Government, including a State,  the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United  States, or a political subdivision of that government. ``Public  aircraft'' does not include a government-owned aircraft transporting  property for commercial purposes and does not include a government-owned  aircraft transporting passengers other than: transporting (for other  than commercial purposes) crewmembers or other persons aboard the  aircraft whose presence is required to perform, or is associated with  the performance of, a governmental function such as firefighting, search  and rescue, law enforcement, aeronautical research, or biological or  geological resource management; or transporting (for other than  commercial purposes) persons aboard the aircraft if the aircraft is  operated by the Armed Forces or an intelligence agency of the United  States. Notwithstanding any limitation relating to use of the aircraft  for commercial purposes, an aircraft shall be considered to be a public  aircraft without regard to whether it is operated by a unit of  government on behalf of another unit of government pursuant to a cost  reimbursement agreement, if the unit of government on whose behalf the  operation is conducted certifies to the Administrator of the Federal  Aviation Administration that the operation was necessary to respond to a  significant and imminent threat to life or property (including natural  resources) and that no service by a private operator was   reasonably available to meet the threat.</p><p class="depth0">Serious injury means any injury which: (1) Requires hospitalization  for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date of the  injury was received; (2) results in a fracture of any bone (except  simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); (3) causes severe  hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage; (4) involves any internal  organ; or (5) involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns  affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface.</p><p class="depth0">Substantial damage means damage or failure which adversely affects  the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the  aircraft, and which would normally require major repair or replacement  of the affected component. Engine failure or damage limited to an engine  if only one engine fails or is damaged, bent fairings or cowling, dented  skin, small punctured holes in the skin or fabric, ground damage to  rotor or propeller blades, and damage to landing gear, wheels, tires,  flaps, engine accessories, brakes, or wingtips are not considered  ``substantial damage'' for the purpose of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Unmanned aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the  operation of any public or civil unmanned aircraft system that takes  place between the time that the system is activated with the purpose of  flight and the time that the system is deactivated at the conclusion of  its mission, in which:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any person suffers death or serious injury; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The aircraft has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 300 pounds or  greater and sustains substantial damage.
