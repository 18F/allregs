                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Add-on control means an air pollution control device, such as a thermal oxidizer or carbon adsorber, that reduces pollution in an air stream by destruction or removal before discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">As-applied means the condition of a coating at the time of application to a substrate, including any added solvent.</p><p class="depth0">As purchased means the condition of a coating, printing, slashing, dyeing, or finishing material as delivered to the affected source, before alteration.</p><p class="depth0">Capture device means a hood, enclosure, room, floor sweep, or other means of containing or collecting emissions and directing those emissions into an add-on air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0">Capture efficiency means the portion (expressed as a percentage) of the pollutants from an emission source that is delivered to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means one or more capture devices intended to collect emissions generated by a web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation in the use of regulated materials, both at the point of application and at subsequent points where emissions from the regulated materials occur, such as flashoff, drying, or curing. As used in this subpart, multiple capture devices that collect emissions generated by a web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation are considered a single capture system.</p><p class="depth0">Cleaning material means a solvent used to remove contaminants and other materials, such as dirt, grease, or oil, from a textile before a web coating/printing operation (surface preparation) or from equipment associated with the web coating/ printing operation, such as tanks, rollers, rotary screens, and knife or wiper blades. Thus, it includes any cleaning material used in the web coating and printing subcategory for surface preparation of substrates or process operation equipment cleaning or both with the exception of cleaning material applied to the substrate using handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers.</p><p class="depth0">Coating means the application of a semi-liquid coating material to one or both sides of a textile web substrate. Once the coating material is dried (and cured, if necessary), it bonds with the textile to form a continuous solid film for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Coating does not include finishing where the fiber is impregnated with a chemical or resin to impart certain properties, but a solid film is not formed.</p><p class="depth0">Coating material means an elastomer, polymer, or prepolymer material applied as a thin layer to a textile web. Such materials include, but are not limited to, coatings, sealants, inks, and adhesives. Decorative, protective, or functional materials that consist only of acids, bases, or any combination of these substances are not considered coating material for the purposes of this subpart. Thinning materials also are not included in this definition of coating materials, but are accounted for separately.</p><p class="depth0">Coating operation means equipment used to apply cleaning materials to a web substrate to prepare it for coating material application (surface preparation), to apply coating material to a web substrate (coating application) and to dry or cure the coating material after application by exposure to heat or radiation (coating drying or curing), or to clean coating operation equipment (equipment cleaning). A single coating operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a coating or cleaning material is applied and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP emissions from that coating or cleaning material occur. There may be multiple coating operations in an affected source. Coating material application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, or marking pens is not a coating operation for the purposes of this subpart. Polyurethane foam carpet backing operations are not coating operations for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Container means any portable device in which a material is stored, conveyed, treated, disposed of, or otherwise handled.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous parameter monitoring system means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this subpart, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of coating or printing operation, or capture system, or add-on control device parameters.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation means a web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation from which some or all of the organic HAP emissions are routed through an emission capture system and add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emission limit, or operating limit, or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limit, or operating limit, or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Dyeing means the process of applying color to the whole body of a textile substrate with either natural or synthetic dyes. Dyes are applied to yarn, fiber, cord, or fabric in aqueous solutions and dried before or after finishing, depending on the process. Continuous dyeing processes include, but are not limited to thermosol, pad/steam, pad/dry, and rope range dyeing. Batch dyeing processes include, but are not limited to, jet, beck, stock, yarn, kier, beam, pad, package and skein dyeing.</p><p class="depth0">Dyeing materials means the purchased dyes and dyeing auxiliaries that are used in the dyeing process. The dyes are the substances that add color to textiles through incorporation into the fiber by chemical reaction, absorption or dispersion. Dyeing auxiliaries are various substances that can be added

to the dyebath to aid dyeing. Dyeing auxiliaries may be necessary to transfer the dye from the dyebath to the fiber or they may provide improvements in the dyeing process or characteristics of the dyed fiber.</p><p class="depth0">Dyeing operation means the collection of equipment used to dye a textile substrate and includes equipment used for dye application, dye fixation, and textile substrate rinsing and drying. A single dyeing operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a dyeing material is applied and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP emissions from that dyeing material occur.

Two or more fabrics or textiles or a fabric and a paper substrate may be bonded with an adhesive to form a laminate. The bonding of a fabric substrate to paper is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer's formulation data means data on a material (such as a coating, printing, slashing, dyeing and finishing) that are supplied by the material manufacturer based on knowledge of the ingredients used to manufacture that material, rather than based on testing of the material. Manufacturer's formulation data may include, but are not limited to, information on density, organic HAP content, and coating, printing, dyeing, slashing, finishing, thinning, or cleaning material content.</p><p class="depth0">Mass fraction of organic HAP means the ratio of the mass of organic HAP to the mass of a material in which it is contained; kg of organic HAP per kg of material.</p><p class="depth0">Month means a calendar month or a pre-specified period of 28 days to 35 days to allow for flexibility in recordkeeping when data are based on a business accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">No organic HAP means no organic HAP is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds.
