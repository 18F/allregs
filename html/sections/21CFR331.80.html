terms of the minimum dosage recommended per minimum time interval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May contain an indication for the symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with the diagnosis of peptic ulcer, gastritis, peptic esophagitis, gastric hyperacidity, and hiatal hernia.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For products containing basic aluminum carbonate gel identified in Sec. 331.11(a)(1)--Indication. ``For the treatment, control, or management of hyperphosphatemia, or for use with a low phosphate diet to prevent formation of phosphate urinary stones, through the reduction of phosphates in the serum and urine.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For products containing aluminum identified in Sec. 331.11(a)--Warnings. (i) Prolonged use of aluminum-containing antacids in patients with renal failure may result in or worsen dialysis osteomalacia. Elevated tissue aluminum levels contribute to the development of the dialysis encephalopathy and osteomalacia syndromes. Small amounts of aluminum are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and renal excretion of aluminum is impaired in renal failure. Aluminum is not well removed by dialysis because it is bound to albumin and transferrin, which do not cross dialysis membranes. As a result, aluminum is deposited in bone, and dialysis osteomalacia may develop when large amounts of aluminum are ingested orally by patients with impaired renal function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prolonged use of aluminum-containing antacids in patients with renal failure may result in or worsen dialysis osteomalacia.
