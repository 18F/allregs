                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to provide notices. You must provide any privacy notices and  opt out notices, including short-form initial notices, that this part  requires so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive  actual notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examples of reasonable expectation of actual notice. You may  reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual notice if you:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of  the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the consumer who conducts transactions electronically,  clearly and conspicuously post the notice on the electronic site and  require the consumer to acknowledge receipt of the notice as a necessary  step to obtaining a particular financial product or service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For an isolated transaction with the consumer, such as an ATM  transaction, post the notice on the ATM screen and require the consumer  to acknowledge receipt of the notice as a necessary step to obtaining  the particular financial product or service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of unreasonable expectation of actual notice. You may  not, however, reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual  notice of your privacy policies and practices if you:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Only post a sign in your branch or office or generally publish  advertisements of your privacy policies and practices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Send the notice via electronic mail to a consumer who does not  obtain a financial product or service from you electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual notices only. You may reasonably expect that a customer  will receive actual notice of your annual privacy notice if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer uses your web site to access financial products and  services electronically and agrees to receive notices at the web site  and you post your current privacy notice continuously in a clear and  conspicuous manner on the web site; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The customer has requested that you refrain from sending any  information regarding the customer relationship, and your current  privacy notice remains available to the customer upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Oral description of notice insufficient. You may not provide any  notice required by this part solely by orally explaining the notice,  either in person or over the telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retention or accessibility of notices for customers--(1) For  customers only, you must provide the initial notice required by Sec.  313.4(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the annual notice required by Sec. 313.5(a), and the  revised notice required by Sec. 313.8 so that the customer can retain  them or obtain them later in writing or, if the customer agrees,  electronically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of retention or accessibility. You provide a privacy  notice to the customer so that the customer can retain it or obtain it  later if you:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the customer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of  the customer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make your current privacy notice available on a web site (or a  link to another web site) for the customer who obtains a financial  product or   service electronically and agrees to receive the notice at the web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Joint notice with other financial institutions. You may provide  a joint notice from you and one or more of your affiliates or other  financial institutions, as identified in the notice, as long as the  notice is accurate with respect to you and the other institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Joint relationships. If two or more consumers jointly obtain a  financial product or service from you, you may satisfy the initial,  annual, and revised notice requirements of Sec. Sec. 313.4(a),  313.5(a), and 313.8(a) by providing one notice to those consumers  jointly, unless one or more of those consumers requests separate  notices.</p>
