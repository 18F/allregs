If such certification is not made, title to the property shall  vest in the State Office, which shall seek to have the property used for  criminal justice purposes elsewhere in the state prior to using it or  disposing of it in any other manner. If a State Office does not exist,  certification will be made directly to the Bureau of Justice Assistance.</p>
