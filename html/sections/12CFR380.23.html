Without limitation, ``amounts owed to the United States'' include all of the following, which all shall have equal priority under Sec. 380.21(a)(3):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unsecured amounts owed to the Corporation for any extension of credit by the Corporation, including any amounts made available under 12 U.S.C. 5384(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unsecured amounts owed to the U.S. Treasury on account of unsecured tax liabilities of the covered financial company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unsecured amounts paid or payable by the Corporation pursuant to its guarantee of any debt issued by the covered financial company under the Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program, 12 CFR part 370, any widely available debt guarantee program authorized under 12 U.S.C. 5612, or any other debt or obligation of any kind or nature that is guaranteed by the Corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The unsecured amount of any debt owed to a Federal reserve bank including loans made through programs or facilities authorized under the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any unsecured amount expressly designated in writing in a form acceptable to the Corporation by the appropriate United States department, agency or instrumentality that shall specify the particular debt, obligation or amount to be included as an ``amount owed to the United States'' for the purpose of this rule at the time of such advance, guaranty or other transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other than those amounts included in paragraph (a) of this section, unsecured amounts owed to a department, agency or instrumentality of the United States that are obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the business of the covered financial company prior to the appointment of the receiver generally will not be in the class of claims designated as ``amounts owed to the United States'' under section 380.21(a)(3), including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unsecured amounts owed to government sponsored entities including, without limitation, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unsecured amounts owed to Federal Home Loan Banks; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unsecured amounts owed as satisfaction of filing, registration or permit fees due to any government department, agency or instrumentality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The United States may, in its sole discretion, consent to subordinate the repayment of any amount owed to the United States to any other obligation of the covered financial company provided that such consent is provided in writing in a form acceptable to the Corporation by the appropriate department, agency or instrumentality and shall specify the particular debt, obligation or other amount to be subordinated including the amount thereof and shall reference this paragraph (c) or 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(1); and provided further that unsecured claims of the United States shall, at a minimum, have a higher priority than liabilities of the covered financial company that count as regulatory capital on the books and records of the covered financial company.</p>
