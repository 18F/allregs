                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employees employed ``in the establishment,'' if employed ``in  such operations'' as previously explained, are to be counted in  determining whether the five-employee limitation on the exemption is  exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employees employed ``in'' the establishment clearly include all  employees engaged, other than casually or sporadically, in performing  any duties of their employment there, regardless of whether they are  direct employees of the country elevator establishment or are employees  of a farmer, independent contractor, or other person who are suffered or  permitted to work (see Act, section 3(g)) in the establishment. However,  tradesmen, such as dealers and their salesmen, for example, are not  employed in the elevator simply because they visit the establishment to  do business there. Neither are workers   who deliver, on behalf of their employers, goods used in the sideline  business of the establishment to be considered employed in the elevator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The use of the language ``employed in'' rather than ``engaged  in'' makes it plain also that the employees to be counted include all  those employed by the establishment in its operations without regard to  whether they are engaged in the establishment or away from it in  performing their duties. This has been the consistent interpretation of  similar language in other sections of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Employees ``Employed * * * By'' The Country Elevator Establishment</p>
