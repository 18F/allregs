                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to deliver. When Federal law enforcement authorities  display proper credentials and Federal warrants for the arrest of  members, civilian employees, civilian contractors and their employees,  or dependents residing at or located on a Department of the Navy  installation, commanding officers are authorized to and should allow the  arrest of the individual sought. The exceptions in Sec. 720.9 may be  applied to members. A judge advocate of the Navy or Marine Corps should  be consulted before delivery is effected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agreement not required of Federal authorities. The agreement  described in Sec. 720.6 is not a condition to the delivery of members  to Federal law enforcement authorities. Regardless of whether the member  is convicted or acquitted, after final disposition of the case,   the member will be returned to the Naval Service (provided that naval  authorities desire his return) and the necessary expenses will be paid  from an appropriation under the control of the Department of Justice.</p>
