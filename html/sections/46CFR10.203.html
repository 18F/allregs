Posting of the officer endorsement may be necessary as required in 46 U.S.C. 7110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Although an MMD and an MMC serve as certificates of identification, a TWIC must be retained by the mariner to whom it was issued and, while valid, serves as the mariner's primary identification document. The TWIC must be produced to verify identity when required by an authorized official as identified in 33 CFR 101.515(d).</p>
