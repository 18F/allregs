                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A credit is allowed under section 2011 against the Federal estate tax for estate, inheritance, legacy or succession taxes actually paid to any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or, in the case of decedents dying before September 3, 1958, any possession of the United States (hereinafter referred to as ``State death taxes''). The credit, however, is allowed only for State death taxes paid (1) with respect to property included in the decedent's gross estate, and (2) with respect to the decedent's estate. The amount of the credit is subject to the limitation described in paragraph (b) of this section. It is subject to further limitations described in Sec. 20.2011-2 if a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for State death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift. See paragraph (a) of Sec. 20.2014-1 as to the allowance of a credit for death taxes paid to a possession of the United States in a case where the decedent died after September 2, 1958.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amount of credit. (1) If the decedent's taxable estate does not exceed $40,000, the credit for State death taxes is zero. If the decedent's taxable estate does exceed $40,000, the credit for State death taxes is limited to an amount computed in accordance with the following table:</p><p class="depth0">Table for Computation of Maximum Credit for State Death Taxes------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>--Rates of</p><p class="depth0">credit on</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>--Taxable        (B)--Taxable     (C)--Credit on     excess overestate equal to or  estate less than-- amount in column     amount in</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>           column (A)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(percent)</em>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$40,000             $90,000     ................            0.8</p><p class="depth0">90,000             140,000              $400               1.6</p><p class="depth0">140,000             240,000             1,200               2.4</p><p class="depth0">240,000             440,000             3,600               3.2</p><p class="depth0">440,000             640,000            10,000               4.0</p><p class="depth0">640,000             840,000            18,000               4.8</p><p class="depth0">840,000           1,040,000            27,600               5.6</p><p class="depth0">1,040,000           1,540,000            38,800               6.4</p><p class="depth0">1,540,000           2,040,000            70,800               7.2</p><p class="depth0">2,040,000           2,540,000           106,800               8.0</p><p class="depth0">2,540,000           3,040,000           146,800               8.8</p><p class="depth0">3,040,000           3,540,000           190,800               9.6</p><p class="depth0">3,540,000           4,040,000           238,800              10.4</p><p class="depth0">4,040,000           5,040,000           290,800              11.2</p><p class="depth0">5,040,000           6,040,000           402,800              12.0</p><p class="depth0">6,040,000           7,040,000           522,800              12.8</p><p class="depth0">7,040,000           8,040,000           650,800              13.6</p><p class="depth0">8,040,000           9,040,000           786,800              14.4</p><p class="depth0">9,040,000          10,040,000           930,800              15.2</p><p class="depth0">10,040,000      .................      1,082,800              16.0------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The decedent died January 1, 1955, leaving a taxable estate of $150,000. On January 1, 1956, inheritance taxes totaling $2,500 were actually paid to a State with respect to property included in the decedent's gross estate. Reference to the table discloses that the specified amount in column (A) nearest to but less than the value of the decedent's taxable estate is $140,000. The maximum credit in respect of this amount, as indicated in column (C), is $1,200. The amount by which the taxable estate exceeds the same specified amount is $10,000. The maximum credit in respect of this amount, computed at the rate of 2.4 percent indicated in column (D), is $240. Thus, the maximum credit in respect of the decedent's taxable estate of $150,000 is $1,440, even though $2,500 in inheritance taxes was actually paid to the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, in subdivision (i) of this example, the amount actually paid to the State was $950, the credit for State death taxes would be limited to $950. If, in subdivision (i) of this example, the decedent's taxable estate was $35,000, no credit for State death taxes would be allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Miscellaneous limitations and conditions to credit--(1) Period of limitations. The credit for State death taxes is limited under section 2011(c) to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the estate tax return for the decedent's estate. If, however, a petition has been filed with the Tax Court of the United States for the redetermination of a deficiency within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return or within 60 days after the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, whichever period is the last to expire. Similarly, if an extension of time has been granted under section 6161 for payment of the tax shown on the return, or of a deficiency, the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return, or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, whichever period is last to expire. If a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment of the Federal estate tax is filed within the time prescribed in section 6511, the credit for State death taxes is limited to such taxes as were actually paid and credit therefor claimed within four years after the filing of the return or before the expiration of 60 days from the date of mailing by certified or registered mail by the district director to the taxpayer of a notice of disallowance of any part of the claim, or before the expiration of 60 days after a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction becomes final with respect to a timely suit instituted upon the claim, whichever period is the last to expire. See section 2015 for the applicable period of limitations for credit for State death taxes on reversionary or remainder interests if an election is made under section 6163(a) to postpone payment of the estate tax attributable to reversionary or remainder interests. If a claim for refund based on the credit for State death taxes is filed within the applicable period described in this subparagraph, a refund may be made despite the general limitation provisions of sections 6511 and 6512. Any refund based on the credit described in this section shall be made without interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Period of limitations.

Any refund based on the credit described in this section shall be made without interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Submission of evidence. Before the credit for State death taxes is allowed, evidence that such taxes have been paid must be submitted to the district director. The district director may require the submission of a certificate from the proper officer of the taxing State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, showing: (i) The total amount of tax imposed (before adding interest and penalties and before allowing discount); (ii) the amount of any discount allowed; (iii) the amount of any penalties and interest imposed or charged; (iv) the total amount actually paid in cash; and (v) the date or dates of payment. If the amount of these taxes has been redetermined, the amount finally

determined should be stated. The required evidence should be filed with the return, but if that is not convenient or possible, then it should be submitted as soon thereafter as practicable. The district director may require the submission of such additional proof as is deemed necessary to establish the right to the credit. For example, he may require the submission of a certificate of the proper officer of the taxing jurisdiction showing (vi) whether a claim for refund of any part of the State death tax is pending and (vii) whether a refund of any part thereof has been authorized, and if a refund has been made, its date and amount, and a description of the property or interest in respect of which the refund was made. The district director may also require an itemized list of the property in respect of which State death taxes were imposed certified by the officer having custody of the records pertaining to those taxes. In addition, he may require the executor to submit a written statement (containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury) stating whether, to his knowledge, any person has instituted litigation or taken an appeal (or contemplates doing so), the final determination of which may affect the amount of those taxes. See section 2016 concerning the redetermination of the estate tax if State death taxes claimed as credit are refunded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definition of ``basic estate tax''. Section 2011(d) provides definitions of the terms ``basic estate tax'' and ``additional estate tax'', used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and ``estate tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1926'', for the purpose of supplying a means of computing State death taxes under local statutes using those terms, and for use in determining the exemption provided for in section 2201 for estates of certain members of the Armed Forces. See section 2011(e)(3) for a modification of these definitions if a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for State death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift.
