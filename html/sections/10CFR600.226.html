                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for  obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of  1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of  States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits  shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are  defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that  provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more  (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal  year, shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit  requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular  A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements  with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit  Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial  contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental  organizations) providing goods and services to State and local  governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and  local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the  contractor   has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of  Federal funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds  provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be  accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance  with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program  reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six  months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance  with Federal laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the  grantee's own records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have  access to the records and financial statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 600.236  shall be followed.  [53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988.
