Where the seller's obligation to repurchase is limited, the bank's or savings association's loan is measured by the total amount of the paper the seller may ultimately be obligated to repurchase.

Where a participation agreement provides that repayment must be applied first to the portions sold, a pro rata sharing will be deemed to exist only if the agreement also provides that, in the event of a default or comparable event defined in the agreement, participants must share in all subsequent repayments and collections in proportion to their percentage participation at the time of the occurrence of the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That portion of a loan or extension of credit sold as a participation by a national bank or savings association on a nonrecourse basis, provided that the participation results in a pro rata sharing of credit risk proportionate to the respective interests of the originating and participating lenders. Where a participation agreement provides that repayment must be applied first to the portions sold, a pro rata sharing will be deemed to exist only if the agreement also provides that, in the event of a default or comparable event defined in the agreement, participants must share in all subsequent repayments and collections in proportion to their percentage participation at the time of the occurrence of the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When an originating national bank or savings association funds the entire loan, it must receive funding from the participants before the close of business of its next business day. If the participating portions are not received within that period, then the portions funded will be treated as a loan by the originating bank or savings association to the borrower. If the portions so attributed to the borrower exceed the originating bank's or savings association's lending limit, the loan may be treated as nonconforming subject to Sec. 32.6, rather than a violation, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The originating national bank or savings association had a valid and unconditional participation agreement with a participant or participants that was sufficient to reduce the loan to within the originating bank's or savings association's lending limit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The participant reconfirmed its participation and the originating national bank or savings association had no knowledge of any information that would permit the participant to withhold its participation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The participation was to be funded by close of business of the originating national bank's or savings association's next business day; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> That portion of one or more loans or extensions of credit, not to exceed 10 percent of capital and surplus, with respect to which the national bank or savings association has purchased protection in the form of a single-name credit derivative that meets the requirements of Sec. 32.2(m)(1) through (7) from an eligible protection provider if the reference obligor is the same legal entity as the borrower in the loan or extension of credit and the maturity of the protection purchased equals or exceeds the maturity of the loan or extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Person means an individual; sole proprietorship; partnership; joint venture; association; trust; estate; business trust; corporation; limited liability company; not-for-profit corporation; sovereign government or agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof; or any similar entity or organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Qualifying central counterparty has the same meaning as this term has in 12 CFR 3.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Qualifying commitment to lend means a legally binding written commitment to lend that, when combined with all other outstanding loans and qualifying commitments to a borrower, was within the national bank's or savings association's lending limit when entered into, and has not been disqualified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether a commitment is within the national bank's or savings association's lending limit when made, the bank or savings association may deduct from the amount of the commitment the amount of any legally binding loan participation commitments that are issued concurrent with the bank's or savings association's commitment and that would be excluded from the definition of ``loan or extension of credit'' under paragraph (q)(2)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the national bank or savings association subsequently chooses to make an additional loan and that subsequent loan, together with all outstanding loans and qualifying commitments to a borrower, exceeds the

bank's or savings association's applicable lending limit at that time, the bank's or savings association's qualifying commitments to the borrower that exceed the bank's or savings association's lending limit at that time are deemed to be permanently disqualified, beginning with the most recent qualifying commitment and proceeding in reverse chronological order. When a commitment is disqualified, the entire commitment is disqualified and the disqualified commitment is no longer considered a ``loan or extension of credit.'' Advances of funds under a disqualified or non-qualifying commitment may only be made to the extent that the advance, together with all other outstanding loans to the borrower, do not exceed the bank's or savings association's lending limit at the time of the advance, calculated pursuant to Sec. 32.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Qualifying master netting agreement has the same meaning as this term has in 12 CFR 3.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Readily marketable collateral means financial instruments and bullion that are salable under ordinary market conditions with reasonable promptness at a fair market value determined by quotations based upon actual transactions on an auction or similarly available daily bid and ask price market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Readily marketable staple means an article of commerce, agriculture, or industry, such as wheat and other grains, cotton, wool, and basic metals such as tin, copper and lead, in the form of standardized interchangeable units, that is easy to sell in a market with sufficiently frequent price quotations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An article comes within this definition if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The exact price is easy to determine; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The staple itself is easy to sell at any time at a price that would not be considerably less than the amount at which it is valued as collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether an article qualifies as a readily marketable staple is determined on the basis of the conditions existing at the time the loan or extension of credit that is secured by the staples is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Residential housing units mean:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Homes (including a dwelling unit in a multi-family residential property such as a condominium or a cooperative);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Combinations of homes and business property (i.e., a home used in part for business);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other real estate used for primarily residential purposes other than a home (but which may include homes);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combinations of such real estate and business property involving only minor business use (i.e., where no more than 20 percent of the total appraised value of the real estate is attributable to the business use);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Farm residences and combinations of farm residences and commercial farm real estate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Property to be improved by the construction of such structures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Leasehold interests in the above real estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)</em> Residential real estate loan means a loan or extension of credit that is secured by 1-4 family residential real estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(z)</em> Sale of Federal funds means any transaction between depository institutions involving the transfer of immediately available funds resulting from credits to deposit balances at Federal Reserve Banks, or from credits to new or existing deposit balances due from a correspondent depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(aa)</em> Securities financing transaction means a repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(bb)</em> Security has the same meaning as in section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(cc)</em> Small business loan means a loan or extension of credit ``secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties'' or ``a commercial or industrial loan'' as defined in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(dd)</em> Small farm loans or extensions of credit means ``loans to small farms,'' as defined in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ee)</em> Standby letter of credit means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, that represents an obligation to

the beneficiary on the part of the issuer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To make payment on account of any default by the account party in the performance of an obligation.
