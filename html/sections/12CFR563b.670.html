                            <p class="depth0">OTS will generally approve your application to engage in a voluntary supervisory conversion unless it determines:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You do not meet the eligibility requirements for a voluntary supervisory conversion under Sec. Sec. 563b.625 or 563b.630 or because the proceeds from the sale of your conversion stock, less the expenses of the conversion, would be insufficient to satisfy any applicable viability requirement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transaction is detrimental to or would cause potential injury to you or the Deposit Insurance Fund or is contrary to the public interest;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You or your acquiror, or the controlling parties or directors and officers of you or your acquiror, have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in connection with the voluntary supervisory conversion; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You fail to justify an employment contract incidental to the conversion, or the employment contract will be an unsafe or unsound practice or represent a sale of control. In a voluntary supervisory conversion, OTS generally will not approve employment contracts of more than one year for your existing management.
