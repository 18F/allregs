Memoranda, affidavits, or other documents  supporting a motion shall be served and filed with the motion. All  motions shall contain a proposed order setting forth the relief sought.  All written motions shall be filed with the Secretary and served upon  all parties, and all motions addressed to the Commission shall be in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Opposition to motions. Within ten (10) days after service of any  written motion or petition or within such longer or shorter time as may  be designated by these Rules or by the Presiding Officer or the  Commission, any party who opposes the granting of the requested order,  ruling or action may file a written response to the motion. Failure to  respond to a written motion may, in the discretion of the Presiding  Officer, be considered as consent to the granting of the relief sought  in the motion. Unless otherwise permitted by the Presiding Officer or  the Commission, there shall be no reply to the response expressing  opposition to the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rulings on motions for dismissal. When a motion to dismiss a  complaint or a motion for other relief is granted, with the result that  the proceedings before the Presiding Officer are terminated, the  Presiding Officer shall issue an Initial Decision and Order in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1025.51. If such a motion is  granted as to all issues alleged in the complaint in regard to some, but  not all, respondents or is granted as to any part of the allegations in  regard to any or all respondents, the Presiding Officer shall enter an  order on the record and consider the remaining issues in the Initial  Decision.
