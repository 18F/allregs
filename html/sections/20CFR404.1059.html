                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Persons who were interned during any period of time from December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946, by the United States Government at a place operated by the Government within the United States for the internment of United States citizens of Japanese ancestry are deemed to have been paid wages (in addition to wages actually paid) as provided in paragraph (c) of this section during any period after attaining age 18 while interned. This provision is effective for determining entitlement to, and the amount of, any monthly benefit for months after December 1972, for determining entitlement to, and the amount of, any lump-sum death payment in the case of a death after December 1972, and for establishing a period of disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information needed to process deemed wages. Unless we have already made a determination on deemed wages for a period of internment of an individual, any person applying for a monthly benefit, a recalculation of benefits by reason of this section, or a lump-sum death payment, must submit certain information before the benefit or payment may be computed on the basis of deemed wages. This information is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The place where the individual worked before internment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The highest hourly wage before internment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The place and date of internment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Date of birth (if not previously furnished);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether or not another Federal benefit is being received based wholly or in part upon the period of internment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a woman, her maiden name.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of deemed wages. The amount of wages which may be deemed is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employed prior to internment. If the individual was employed before being interned, the deemed wages are the greater of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The highest actual hourly rate of pay received for any employment before internment, multiplied by 40 for each full week during the period of internment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal minimum hourly rate in effect for the period of internment, multiplied by 40 for each full week during that period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Self-employed or not employed prior to internment. If the individual was self-employed or was not employed before the period of internment, the deemed wages are the Federal minimum hourly rate in effect for that period, multiplied by 40 for each full week during the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When wages are not deemed. Wages are not deemed under this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any period before the quarter in which the individual attained age 18; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a larger benefit is payable without the deemed wages; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a benefit based in whole or in part upon internment is determined by any agency of the United States to be payable under any other law of the United States or under a system set up by that agency. However, this exception does not apply in cases where the failure to receive deemed wages reduces the primary insurance amount by 50 cents or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification of internment. The certification concerning the internment is made by the Archivist of the United States or his or her representative. After the internment has been verified, wages are deemed to have been paid to the internee.
