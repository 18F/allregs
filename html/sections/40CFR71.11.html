Any supporting materials that are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. In the case of a program delegated pursuant to Sec. 71.10, if requested by the Administrator, the permitting authority shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA. The permitting authority may direct commenters to provide such materials directly to EPA. A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this section.

The 30-day period within which a person may request review under this section begins with the service of notice of the permitting authority's action unless a later date is specified in that notice, except that the 30-day period within which a person may request review of a minor permit modification or administrative amendment begins upon the effective date of such action to revise the permit. The petition shall include a statement of the reasons supporting that review, including a demonstration that any issues raised were raised during the public comment period (including any public hearing) to the extent required by these regulations unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period, and, when appropriate, a showing that the condition in question is based on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days after a final permit decision has been issued, any person who filed comments on the draft permit or participated in the public hearing may petition the Environmental Appeals Board to review any condition of the permit decision.

A final permit decision shall be issued by the permitting authority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the Board issues notice to the parties that review has been denied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the Board issues a decision on the merits of the appeal and the decision does not include a remand of the proceedings; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon the completion of remand proceedings if the proceedings are remanded, unless the Board's remand order specifically provides that appeal of the remand decision will be required to exhaust administrative remedies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Motions to reconsider a final order shall be filed within ten (10) days after service of the final order. Every such motion must set forth the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the nature of the alleged errors.

(1) Any interested person (including the permittee) may petition the permitting authority to reopen a permit for cause, and the permitting authority may commence a permit reopening on its own initiative. However, the permitting authority shall not revise, revoke and reissue, or terminate a permit except for the reasons specified in Sec. 71.7(f)(1) or Sec. 71.6(a)(6)(i).

Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the permitting authority may be informally appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the permitting authority to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (n)(3) of this section. The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the permitting authority decides the request is justified and that cause exists to revise, revoke and reissue or terminate a permit, it shall initiate proceedings to reopen the permit pursuant to Sec. 71.7(f) or Sec. 71.7(g).
