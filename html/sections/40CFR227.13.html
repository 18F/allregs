                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Dredged materials are bottom sediments or materials that have  been dredged or excavated from the navigable waters of the United  States, and their disposal into ocean waters is regulated by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers using the criteria of applicable sections of  parts 227 and 228. Dredged material consists primarily of natural  sediments or materials which may be contaminated by municipal or  industrial wastes or by runoff from terrestrial sources such as  agricultural lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em>, (2), or (3) of this section is  environmentally acceptable for ocean dumping without further testing  under this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dredged material is composed predominantly of sand, gravel,  rock, or any other naturally occurring bottom material with particle  sizes larger than silt, and the material is found in areas of high  current or wave energy such as streams with large bed loads or coastal  areas with shifting bars and channels; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dredged material is for beach nourishment or restoration and is  composed predominantly of sand, gravel or shell with particle sizes  compatible with material on the receiving beaches; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When: (i) The material proposed for dumping is substantially the  same as the substrate at the proposed disposal site; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The site from which the material proposed for dumping is to be  taken is far removed from known existing and historical sources of  pollution so as to provide reasonable assurance that such material has  not been contaminated by such pollution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When dredged material proposed for ocean dumping does not meet  the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section, further testing of the  liquid, suspended particulate, and solid phases, as defined in Sec.  227.32, is required. Based on the results of such testing, dredged  material can be considered to be environmentally acceptable for ocean  dumping only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The material is in compliance with the requirements of Sec.  227.6; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All major constituents of the liquid phase are in compliance  with the applicable marine water quality criteria after allowance for  initial mixing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the liquid phase contains major constituents not included  in the applicable marine water quality criteria, or there is reason to  suspect synergistic effects of certain contaminants, bioassays on the  liquid phase of the dredged material show that it can be discharged so  as not to exceed the limiting permissible concentration as defined in  paragraph (a) of Sec. 227.27; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bioassays on the suspended particulate and solid phases show  that it can be discharged so as not to exceed the limiting permissible  concentration as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 227.27.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, major  constituents to be analyzed in the liquid phase are those deemed  critical by the District Engineer, after evaluating and considering any  comments received from the Regional Administrator, and considering known  sources of discharges in the area.</p>
