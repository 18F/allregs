                                Sec. 33.503  How does a recipient calculate MBE and WBE participation
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Only certified MBEs and WBEs are to be counted towards  MBE/WBE participation. Amounts of MBE and WBE participation are  calculated as a percentage of total financial assistance agreement  project procurement costs, which include the match portion of the  project costs, if any. For recipients of financial assistance agreements  that capitalize revolving loan programs, the total amount is the total  procurement dollars in the amount of identified loans equal to the  capitalization grant amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ineligible project costs. If all project costs attributable to  MBE and WBE participation are not eligible for funding under the EPA  financial assistance agreement, the recipient may choose to report the  percentage of MBE and WBE participation based on the total eligible and  non-eligible costs of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Joint ventures. For joint ventures, MBE and WBE participation  consists of the portion of the dollar amount of the joint venture  attributable to the MBE or WBE. If an MBE's or WBE's risk of loss,  control or management responsibilities is not commensurate with its  share of the profit, the Agency may direct an adjustment in the  percentage of MBE or WBE participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Central Purchasing or Procurement Centers. A recipient must  report MBE and WBE participation from its central purchasing or  procurement centers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Brokers. A recipient may not count expenditures to a MBE or WBE  that acts merely as a broker or passive conduit of funds, without  performing, managing, or supervising the work of its contract or  subcontract in a manner consistent with normal business practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Presumption. If 50% or more of the total dollar amount of a MBE  or WBE's prime contract is subcontracted to a non-DBE, the MBE or WBE  prime contractor will be presumed to be a broker, and no MBE or WBE  participation may be reported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttal. The MBE or WBE prime contractor may rebut this  presumption by demonstrating that its actions are consistent with normal  practices for prime contractors in its business and that it will  actively perform, manage and supervise the work under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> MBE or WBE Truckers/Haulers. A recipient may count expenditures  to an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler only if the MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is  performing a commercially useful function. The following factors should  be used in determining whether an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is  performing a commercially useful function:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The MBE or WBE must be responsible for the management and  supervision of the entire trucking/hauling operation for which it is  responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived  arrangement for the purpose of meeting MBE or WBE objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The MBE or WBE must itself own and operate at least one fully  licensed, insured, and operational truck used on the contract.</p><p class="depth3">Sec. Appendix A to Part 33--Term and Condition</p><p class="depth3">Each procurement contract signed by an EPA financial assistance  agreement recipient, including those for an identified loan under an EPA  financial assistance agreement capitalizing a revolving loan fund, must  include the following term and condition:</p><p class="depth3">The contractor shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color,  national origin or sex in the performance of this contract. The  contractor shall carry out applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 33 in  the award and administration of contracts awarded under EPA financial  assistance agreements. Failure by the contractor to carry out these  requirements is a material breach of this contract which may result in  the termination of this contract or other legally available remedies.</p>
