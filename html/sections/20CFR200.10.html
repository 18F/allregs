An applicant or a beneficiary shall not be required to hire, retain or utilize the services of an attorney, agent, or other representative in any claim filed with the Board. In the event an applicant or beneficiary desires to be represented by another person, he or she shall file with the Board prior to the time of such representation a power of attorney signed by such applicant or beneficiary and naming such other person as the person authorized to represent the applicant or beneficiary with respect to matters in connection with his or her claim. However, the Board may recognize one of the following persons as the duly authorized representative of the applicant or beneficiary without requiring such power of attorney when it appears that such recognition is in the interest of the applicant or beneficiary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Member of Congress;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person designated by the railway labor organization of which the applicant or beneficiary is a member to act on behalf of members of that organization on such matters; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An attorney who, in the absence of information to the contrary, declares that he or she is representing the applicant or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment of claim. The Board will not certify payment of any awarded claim to or through any person other than the applicant or beneficiary for the reason that a power of attorney for such person to represent such applicant or beneficiary has been filed.
