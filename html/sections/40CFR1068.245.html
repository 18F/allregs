                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After considering the circumstances, we may permit you to  introduce into U.S. commerce engines/equipment that do not comply with  emission-related requirements for a limited time if all the following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unusual circumstances that are clearly outside your control  prevent you from meeting requirements from this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You exercised prudent planning and were not able to avoid the  violation; you have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of  the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No other allowances are available under the regulations in this  chapter to avoid the impending violation, including the provisions of  Sec.  1068.250.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not having the exemption will jeopardize the solvency of your  company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If your unusual circumstances are only related to compliance  with the model-year provisions of Sec.  1068.103(f), we may grant  hardship under this section without a demonstration that the solvency of  your company is in jeopardy as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (3) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your engines/equipment must comply with standards and other  requirements that would have applied if assembly were completed on  schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may generally request this exemption only for engines/ equipment for which assembly has been substantially completed; you may  not begin assembly of any additional engines/equipment under this  exemption after the cause for delay has occurred. We may make an  exception to this general restriction for secondary engine  manufacturers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an example, if your normal production process involves  purchase of partially complete engines and a supplier fails to deliver  all the ordered engines in time for your assembly according to your  previously established schedule as a result of a fire at its factory,  you may request that we treat those engine as if they had been completed  on the original schedule. Note that we would grant relief only for those  engines where you had a reasonable basis for expecting the engines to be  delivered on time based on past performance and terms of purchase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To apply for an exemption, you must send the Designated  Compliance Officer a written request as soon as possible before you are  in violation. In your request, show that you meet all the conditions and  requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Include in your request a plan showing how you will meet all the  applicable requirements as quickly as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must give us other relevant information if we ask for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We may include reasonable additional conditions on an approval  granted under this section, including provisions to recover or otherwise  address the lost environmental benefit or paying fees to offset any  economic gain resulting from the exemption. For example, in the case of  multiple tiers of emission standards, we may require that you meet the  standards from the previous tier whether or not your hardship is granted  under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Add a permanent label to all engines/equipment exempted under  this section, consistent with Sec.  1068.45, with at least the following  items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engine displacement (in liters or cubic centimeters), and model  year of the engine/equipment, (as applicable); or whom to contact for  further information. We may also require that you include maximum engine  power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement describing the engine's status as an exempted  engine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the engine/equipment does not meet any emission standards,  add one of the following statements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ``THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.245 FROM EMISSION  STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> ``THIS EQUIPMENT IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.245 FROM EMISSION  STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the engines/equipment meet alternate emission standards as a  condition of an exemption under this section, we may specify a different  statement to identify the alternate emission standards.</p>
