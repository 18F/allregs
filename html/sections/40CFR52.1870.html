The changes to the SIP include revisions  related to particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers  (PM2.5) defining a significance level for PM2.5  for nonattainment areas, baseline for determining credit for emission  offsets, location of offsetting emissions in nonattainment areas, and  offset requirements. The revisions also include establishing definitions  for emergency, emergency engine, publicly owned treatment works, and  semi-public disposal system and incorporating minor organizational or
