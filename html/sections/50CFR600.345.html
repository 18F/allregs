                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard 8. Conservation and management measures shall,  consistent with the conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens  Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of  overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery  resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data  that are based upon the best scientific information available in order  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide for the sustained participation of such communities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on  such communities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This standard requires that an FMP take into  account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities. This  consideration, however, is within the context of the conservation  requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Deliberations regarding the  importance of fishery resources to affected fishing communities,  therefore, must not compromise the achievement of conservation  requirements and goals of the FMP. Where the preferred alternative  negatively affects the sustained participation of fishing communities,  the FMP should discuss the rationale for selecting this alternative over  another with a lesser impact on fishing communities. All other things  being equal, where two alternatives achieve similar conservation goals,  the alternative that provides the greater potential for sustained  participation of such communities and minimizes the adverse economic  impacts on such communities would be the preferred alternative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This standard does not constitute a basis for allocating  resources to a specific fishing community nor for providing preferential  treatment based on residence in a fishing community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term ``fishing community'' means a community that is  substantially dependent on or substantially engaged in the harvest or  processing of fishery resources to meet social and economic needs, and  includes fishing vessel owners, operators, and crew, and fish processors  that are based in such communities. A fishing community is a social or  economic group whose members reside in a specific location and share a  common dependency on commercial, recreational, or subsistence fishing or  on directly related fisheries-dependent services and industries (for  example, boatyards, ice suppliers, tackle shops).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term ``sustained participation'' means continued access to  the fishery within the constraints of the condition of the resource.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analysis. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FMPs must examine the social and economic  importance of fisheries to communities potentially affected by  management measures. For example, severe reductions of harvests for  conservation purposes may decrease employment opportunities for  fishermen and processing plant workers, thereby adversely affecting  their families and communities. Similarly, a management measure that  results in the allocation of fishery resources among competing sectors  of a fishery may benefit some communities at the expense of others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appropriate vehicle for the analyses under this standard is  the fishery impact statement required by section 303(a)(9) of the  Magnuson-Stevens Act. Qualitative and quantitative data may be used,  including information provided by fishermen, dealers, processors, and  fisheries organizations and associations. In cases where data are  severely limited, effort should be   directed to identifying and gathering needed data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To address the sustained participation of fishing communities  that will be affected by management measures, the analysis should first  identify affected fishing communities and then assess their differing  levels of dependence on and engagement in the fishery being regulated.  The analysis should also specify how that assessment was made. The best  available data on the history, extent, and type of participation of  these fishing communities in the fishery should be incorporated into the  social and economic information presented in the FMP. The analysis does  not have to contain an exhaustive listing of all communities that might  fit the definition; a judgment can be made as to which are primarily  affected. The analysis should discuss each alternative's likely effect  on the sustained participation of these fishing communities in the  fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The analysis should assess the likely positive and negative  social and economic impacts of the alternative management measures, over  both the short and the long term, on fishing communities. Any particular  management measure may economically benefit some communities while  adversely affecting others. Economic impacts should be considered both  for individual communities and for the group of all affected communities  identified in the FMP. Impacts of both consumptive and non-consumptive  uses of fishery resources should be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A discussion of social and economic impacts should identify  those alternatives that would minimize adverse impacts on these fishing  communities within the constraints of conservation and management goals  of the FMP, other national standards, and other applicable law.
