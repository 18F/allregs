The Manager shall at the same time transmit a copy of the notification letter and the individual's response to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of the hearing request from the Manager, the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, shall appoint, as soon as practicable, a Administrative Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediately upon appointment of the Administrative Judge, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall notify the individual and DOE Counsel of the Administrative Judge's identity and the address to which all further correspondence should be sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrative Judge shall have all powers necessary to regulate the conduct of proceedings under this subpart, including, but not limited to, establishing a list of persons to receive service of papers, issuing subpoenas for witnesses to attend the hearing or for the production of specific documents or other physical evidence, administering oaths and affirmations, ruling upon motions, receiving evidence, regulating the course of the hearing, disposing of procedural requests or similar matters, and taking other actions consistent with the regulations in this subpart. Requests for subpoenas shall be liberally granted except where the Administrative Judge finds that the grant of subpoenas would clearly result in evidence or testimony that is repetitious, incompetent, irrelevant, or immaterial to the issues in the case. The Administrative Judge may take sworn testimony, sequester witnesses, and control the dissemination or reproduction of any record or testimony taken pursuant to this part, including correspondence, or other relevant records or tangible evidence including, but not limited to, information retained in computerized or other automated systems in possession of the subpoenaed person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrative Judge will determine the day, time, and place for the hearing.

Normally the location for the hearing will be selected for the convenience of all participants.

Any extension of the hearing date past 90 calendar days from the date the request for hearing is received by the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be

approved by the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p>
