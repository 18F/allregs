Appeal regulations set forth at parts 11 and 780 of  this title apply to determinations made under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determinations not eligible for administrative review or appeal.  CCC determinations and policies that are not limited to a specific  individual producer's application are not to be construed to be  individual program eligibility determinations or adverse decisions and  are, therefore, not subject to administrative review or appeal under 7  CFR part 11 or part 780 of this title (but nothing in the regulations  for this program will limit the ability of the National Appeals Division  to decide its own jurisdiction under part 11). Such determinations  include, but are not limited to, application periods, deadlines, crop  years, prices, general statutory or regulatory provisions that apply to  similarly situated producers, national average payment prices, and  payment factors established by CCC for DWQP for which this subpart  applies or   similar matters requiring CCC determinations.</p>
