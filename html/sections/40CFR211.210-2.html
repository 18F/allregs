The Administrator may grant the manufacturer an extension of up to 20 days from the date of distribution. The manufacturer must provide reasonable assurance that the protectors equal or exceed their mean attenuation values, and that labeling requirements will be satisfied before the extension expires. Requests for extension should go to the Administrator, U.S. Environment Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460. The Administrator must respond to a request within 2 business days. Responses may be either written or oral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer, receiving hearing protectors through the chain of distribution that were labeled by a previous manufacturer, may use that previous manufacturer's data when labeling the protectors for ultimate sale or use, but is responsible for the accuracy of the information on the label. The manufacturer may elect to retest the protectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Labeling requirements regarding each hearing protector category in a manufacturer's product line consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testing hearing protectors according to Sec. 211.206 and the hearing protectors must have been assembled by the manufacturer's normal production process; and it must have been intended for distribution in commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each category of hearing protectors is determined by the combination of at least the following parameters. Manufacturers may use additional parameters as needed to create and identify additional categories of protectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ear muffs.

If an ear insert or ear cap is manufactured in more than one size (small, medium, large, etc.) each size does not constitute a separate category and is not required to be separately label verified. However, each size must be used when conducting the required test to determine the labeled values for the specified category.
