(1) Only refiners and importers may generate, use, transfer or own credits generated under this subpart O.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CRa credits generated pursuant to subpart H of this part in the 2012 and 2013 averaging periods and generated pursuant to Sec. 80.1615 may be used by refiners and importers to meet the applicable annual average sulfur standards of Sec. 80.1603(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> CRa credits generated under Sec. 80.1615 may be used to meet the requirements of either subpart H of this part or this subpart O, subject to the credit life restrictions in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Credits generated under Sec. 80.1615(c) may only be used to meet the requirements of this subpart O.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> CRT2 credits generated under Sec. 80.1615(d) may only be used to meet the requirements of subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Credit life. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, credits are valid for use for five years after the year in which they are generated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credits generated under Sec. 80.1615(b) through (d) are valid for use for five years after the year in which they are generated, except that any CRa credits generated in 2015 and 2016 and any remaining CRT2 credits will expire and become invalid after March 31, 2020, when the 2019 annual compliance report is due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A refiner or importer possessing credits must use all credits prior to falling into a compliance deficit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit transfers.

The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit (``transferor'') may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit (``transferee''); if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make the second, and final, transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit.
