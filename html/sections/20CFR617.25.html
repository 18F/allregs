                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The second sentence of amended section 236(a)(1) of the Act provides that an adversely affected worker shall be entitled to have payment of the costs of training approved under the Act paid on the worker's behalf, subject, however, ``to the limitations imposed by'' section 236. The limitations in section 236 which are implemented in this section concern the restrictions on approval of training which are related directly or indirectly to the conditions on training which are approvable or on the funding of training costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On-the-job training. The costs of on-the-job training approved subpart C of this part for a worker, which are paid from TAA funds, shall be paid in equal monthly installments. Such costs may be paid from TAA funds, and such training may be approved under subpart C of this part, however, only if the State agency determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No currently employed individual is displaced by such eligible worker, including partial displacement such as a reduction in the hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such training does not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of training which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,

written concurrence has been obtained from the concerned labor organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job for which such eligible worker is being trained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The employer has not terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the work force with the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring the eligible worker;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The job for which the eligible worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Such training is not for the same occupation from which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 222 of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The employer certifies to the State agency that the employer will continue to employ the eligible worker for at least 26 weeks after completing the training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does not have due cause to terminate such employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The employer has not received payment under this subpart C or under any other Federal law for any other on-the-job training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section or such other Federal law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section made by the employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by the employer for which the employer has received a payment under subpart C of this part (or the prior provisions of subpart C of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other authority and restrictions on funding--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 236(a) contains several provisions which allow the costs of a training program approved under the Act to be paid--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solely from TAA funds,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solely from other public or private funds, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partly from TAA funds and partly from other public or private funds,
but also precludes the use of TAA funds or funds under another Federal law where such use of funds would result in duplication of payment of training costs. Those authorities and restrictions are spelled out in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, that, private funds may not include funds from sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 236(a)(5)(E) of the Act. (i) In general. Paragraph (5)(E) of section 236(a) of the Act specifies one of the types of training programs approvable under the Act, as including a program (other than a training program described in section 236(a)(7) (paragraph (b)(5) of this section)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of the training program are paid--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (5)(E) of section 236(a) of the Act specifies one of the types of training programs approvable under the Act, as including a program (other than a training program described in section 236(a)(7) (paragraph (b)(5) of this section)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of the training program are paid--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under any Federal or State program other than the Act, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From any source other than TAA funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. Paragraph (E) of section 236(a)(5) of the Act thus authorizes prearrangements between cooperating State agencies administering the TAA program and the authorities administering any other Federal, State, or private funding source, to agree upon any mix of TAA funds and other funds for paying the costs of a training program approved under subpart C of this part. Any such prearrangement must contain specific commitments from the other authorities to pay the costs they agree to assume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 236(a)(6) of the Act. (i) In general. Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is related to section 236(a)(5)(E) in providing that the costs of a training program approved under the Act are not required to be paid from TAA funds to the extent that such costs are paid under any Federal or State program other than the Act or from any source other than the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is related to section 236(a)(5)(E) in providing that the costs of a training program approved under the Act are not required to be paid from TAA funds to the extent that such costs are paid under any Federal or State program other than the Act or from any source other than the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. (A) Although paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is expressed in terms of the costs not being required to be paid from TAA funds, it authorizes the mixing of TAA funds and funds from any other Federal, State or private source. Therefore, sharing the future costs of training is authorized where prior costs

were paid from another Federal, State or private source, but this does not authorize reimbursement from TAA funds of any training costs which were incurred and for which payment became due prior to the approval of the training program under subpart C of this part. In utilizing the authority under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sharing training costs, prearrangements shall be entered into as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section before any TAA funds are obligated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Although paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is expressed in terms of the costs not being required to be paid from TAA funds, it authorizes the mixing of TAA funds and funds from any other Federal, State or private source.

Therefore, before approving any training program under subpart C of this part, which may involve sharing of the training costs under the authority of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cooperating State agencies for the TAA program shall require the worker to enter into a written agreement with the State under which TAA funds will not be applied for or used to pay any portion of the costs of the training the worker has reason to believe will be paid by any other governmental or private source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 236(a)(4) of the Act. (i) In general. (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the costs of training are paid from TAA funds under subpart C of this part, no other payment for such costs of training may be made under any other Federal law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the payment of the costs of training has already been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable under any other Federal law and a portion of the costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of such training costs may not be made from TAA funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) also requires that: The provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the identical costs incurred in training the adversely affected worker under the TAA Program, even if such other use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. (A) Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the direct costs of a training program approvable under subpart C of this part are payable from TAA funds and are also wholly or partially payable under another Federal law, or under any State law or from private, nongovernmental sources, the TAA Program agencies shall establish procedures which ensure that TAA funds shall not be utilized to duplicate funds available from another source, but this preclusion of duplication does not prohibit and shall not discourage sharing of costs under prearrangements authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 236(a), paragraph (b)(4) of this section continues to prohibit duplicate payment of training costs, which is consistent with the general prohibition expressed in subpart C of this part, against any use of TAA funds to duplicate payment of training costs in any circumstances. Paragraph (b)(4) of this section also continues to prohibit taking into account, in determining whether training costs are payable from TAA funds, any payments to the worker under any other Federal law which may have the effect of indirectly paying all or a portion of the training costs. Such indirect payments include Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which are paid to the individual. However, any payments to the individual under these programs are deductible from TRA payable to the individual under Sec. 617.13(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When payments of Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants are made to the training provider, instead of the individual, and are used for training costs, such payments shall be taken into account as direct payment of the training costs under other Federal law for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 236(a)(7) of the Act. (i) In general. Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under the Act, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. Paragraph (7) of section 236(a), which is implemented in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, reinforces the prohibition in Sec. 617.22(h) against approval of a training program under subpart C of this part if the worker is required to pay a fee or tuition. The provisions of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) of this section shall be given effect as prohibiting the approval under subpart C of this part of any training program if the worker would be requested or required, at any time or under any circumstances, to pay any of the costs of a training program, however small, from any TAA funds given to the worker or from any other funds belonging to the worker from any source whatever. Aside from this stringent limitation, however, paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act implicitly authorizes training approved under this subpart C to be wholly or partly funded from nongovernmental (i.e., employer, union or other private) sources.
