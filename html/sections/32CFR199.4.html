                                Sec. 199.4  Basic program benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Scope of benefits. Subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified in this part, the CHAMPUS Basic Program will cost share medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury, including maternity care and well-baby care. Benefits include specified medical services and supplies provided to eligible beneficiaries from authorized civilian sources such as hospitals, other authorized institutional providers, physicians, other authorized individual professional providers, and professional ambulance services, prescription drugs, authorized medical supplies, and rental or purchase of durable equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Scope of benefits. Subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified in this part, the CHAMPUS Basic Program will cost share medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury, including maternity care and well-baby care. Benefits include specified medical services and supplies provided to eligible beneficiaries from authorized civilian sources such as hospitals, other authorized institutional providers, physicians, other authorized individual professional providers, and professional ambulance services, prescription drugs, authorized medical supplies, and rental or purchase of durable equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Impact of TRICARE program. The basic program benefits set forth in this section are applicable to the basic CHAMPUS program. In areas in which the TRICARE program is implemented, certain provisions of Sec. 199.17 will apply instead of the provisions of this section. In those areas, the provisions of Sec. 199.17 will take precedence over any provisions of this section with which they conflict.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Persons eligible for Basic Program benefits. Persons eligible to receive the Basic Program benefits are set forth in Sec. 199.3 of this part. Any person determined to be an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for Basic Program benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Authority to act for CHAMPUS. The authority to make benefit determinations and authorize the disbursement of funds under CHAMPUS is restricted to the Director, OCHAMPUS; designated OCHAMPUS staff; Director, OCHAMPUSEUR; or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. No other persons or agents (such as physicians, staff members of hospitals, or CHAMPUS health benefits advisors) have such authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Status of patient controlling for purposes of cost-sharing. Benefits for covered services and supplies described in this section will be extended either on an inpatient or outpatient cost-sharing basis in accordance with the status of the patient at the time the covered services and supplies were provided, unless otherwise specifically designated (such as for ambulance service or maternity care). For cost-sharing provisions, refer to paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Right to information. As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, OCHAMPUS or its CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries shall be entitled to receive information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, state, or U.S. Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, testing, monitoring, or examination or diagnosis of, or treatment rendered, or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary, and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAMPUS benefits. Before a determination will be made on a request for preauthorization or claim of benefits, a beneficiary or sponsor must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized governmental officials to

investigate and prosecute criminal actions, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disclosure is authorized or required specifically under the terms of the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act (refer to Sec. 199.1(m) of this part).
For the purposes of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of Secs. 199.8, 199.11, and 199.12, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries may release, without consent or notice to any beneficiary or sponsor, to any person, organization, government agency, provider, or other entity any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use published in the Federal Register in accordance with DoD 5400.11-R (Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)). Before a person's claim of benefits will be adjudicated, the person must furnish to CHAMPUS information that reasonably may be expected to be in his or her possession and that is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Physical examinations. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may require a beneficiary to submit to one or more medical (including psychiatric) examinations to determine the beneficiary's entitlement to benefits for which application has been made or for otherwise authorized medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury (including maternity and well-baby care). When a medical examination has been requested, CHAMPUS will withhold payment of any pending claims or preauthorization requests on that particular beneficiary. If the beneficiary refuses to agree to the requested medical examination, or unless prevented by a medical reason acceptable to OCHAMPUS, the examination is not performed within 90 days of initial request, all pending claims for services and supplies will be denied. A denial of payments for services or supplies provided before (and related to) the request for a physical examination is not subject to reconsideration. The medical examination and required beneficiary travel related to performing the requested medical examination will be at the expense of CHAMPUS. The medical examination may be performed by a physician in a Uniformed Services medical facility or by an appropriate civilian physician, as determined and selected by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee who is responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary, including necessary travel arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Claims filing deadline. For all services provided on or after January 1, 1993, to be considered for benefits, all claims submitted for benefits must, except as provided in Sec. 199.7, be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than one year after the services are provided. Unless the requirement is waived, failure to file a claim within this deadline waives all rights to benefits for such services or supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Double coverage and third party recoveries. CHAMPUS claims involving double coverage or the possibility that the United States can recover all or a part of its expenses from a third party, are specifically subject to the provisions of Sec. 199.8 or Sec. 199.12 of this part as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Nonavailability Statements within a 40-mile catchment area. Unless required by action of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) under this paragraph (a)(9), nonavailability statements are not required. If they are required by ASD(HA) action, in some geographic locations, CHAMPUS beneficiaries not enrolled in TRICARE Prime may be required to obtain a nonavailability statement from a military medical treatment facility in order to receive specifically identified health care services from a civilian provider. If the required care cannot be provided through the Uniformed Service facility, the hospital commander, or a designee, will issue a Nonavailability Statement (NAS) (DD Form 1251). Failure to secure such a statement may waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS/TRICARE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the exception of maternity services, the ASD(HA) may require an NAS prior to TRICARE cost-sharing

for additional services from civilian sources if such services are to be provided to a beneficiary who lives within a 40-mile catchment area of an MTF where such services are available and the ASD(HA):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrates that significant costs would be avoided by performing specific procedures at the affected MTF or MTFs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determines that a specific procedure must be provided at the affected MTF or MTFs to ensure the proficiency levels of the practitioners at the MTF or MTFs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determines that the lack of NAS data would significantly interfere with TRICARE contract administration; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Provides notification of the ASD(HA)'s intent to require an NAS under this authority to covered beneficiaries who receive care at the MTF or MTFs that will be affected by the decision to require an NAS under this authority; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Provides at least 60-day notification to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the ASD(HA)'s intent to require an NAS under this authority, the reason for the NAS requirement, and the date that an NAS will be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules in effect at the time civilian medical care is provided apply. The applicable rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered apply in determining whether a NAS is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Director, TMA is responsible for issuing the procedural rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements. Such rules and regulations should address:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When and for what services a NAS is required. However, a NAS may not be required for services otherwise available at an MTF located within a 40-mile radius of the beneficiary's residence when another insurance plan or program provides the beneficiary's primary coverage for the services. This requirement for an NAS does not apply to beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime, even when those beneficiaries use the point-of-service option under Sec. 199.17(n)(3) of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When and how notifications will be made to a beneficiary who is not enrolled in TRICARE Prime as to whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area that requires obtaining a NAS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> What information relating to claims submissions, including the documentation, if any, that is required to document that a valid NAS was issued. However, when documentation of a NAS is required, then that documentation shall be valid for the adjudication of CHAMPUS claims for all related care otherwise authorized by this part which is received from a civilian source while the beneficiary resided within the Uniformed Service facility catchment area which issued the NAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of any service subject to a NAS requirement under this paragraph (a)(9) and also subject to a preadmission (or other pre-service) authorization requirement under Sec. 199.4 or Sec. 199.15 of this part, the administrative processes for the NAS and pre-service authorization may be combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. All benefits under the CHAMPUS program are subject to review under the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program pursuant to Sec. 199.15. (Utilization and quality review of mental health services are also part of the Peer Review Organization program, and are addressed in paragraph (a)(12) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Utilization review, quality assurance and reauthorization for inpatient mental health services and partial hospitalization. (i) In general. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall provide, either directly or through contract, a program of utilization and quality review for all mental health care services. Among other things, this program shall include mandatory preadmission authorization before nonemergency inpatient mental health services may be provided and mandatory approval of continuation of inpatient services within 72 hours of emergency admissions. This program shall also include requirements for other pretreatment authorization procedures, concurrent review of continuing inpatient and partial

hospitalization, retrospective review, and other such procedures as determined appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS. The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section and Sec. 199.15(f) shall apply to this program. The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall establish, pursuant to that Sec. 199.15(f), procedures substantially comparable to requirements of paragraph (h) of this section and Sec. 199.15. If the utilization and quality review program for mental health care services is provided by contract, the contractor(s) need not be the same contractor(s) as are engaged under Sec. 199.15 in connection with the review of other services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

(A) This section generally requires preadmission authorization for all non-emergency inpatient mental health services and prompt continued stay authorization after emergency admissions with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section. It also requires preadmission authorization for all admissions to a partial hospitalization program, without exception, as the concept of an emergency admission does not pertain to a partial hospitalization level of care. Institutional services for which payment would otherwise be authorized, but which were provided without compliance with preadmission authorization requirements, do not qualify for the same payment that would be provided if the preadmission requirements had been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> This section generally requires preadmission authorization for all non-emergency inpatient mental health services and prompt continued stay authorization after emergency admissions with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section.

The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue policies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, standards and/or criteria to implement this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Institutional benefits--(1) General. Services and supplies provided by an institutional provider authorized as set forth in Sec. 199.6 may be cost-shared only when such services or supplies: are otherwise authorized by this part; are medically necessary; are ordered, directed, prescribed, or delivered by an OCHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider as set forth in Sec. 199.6 or by an employee of the authorized institutional provider who is otherwise eligible to be a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider; are delivered in accordance with generally accepted norms for clinical practice in the United States; meet established quality standards; and comply with applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, exceptions, or exclusions as otherwise set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Services and supplies provided by an institutional provider authorized as set forth in Sec. 199.6 may be cost-shared only when such services or supplies: are otherwise authorized by this part; are medically necessary; are ordered, directed, prescribed, or delivered by an OCHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider as set forth in Sec. 199.6 or by an employee of the authorized institutional provider who is otherwise eligible to be a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider; are delivered in accordance with generally accepted norms for clinical practice in the United States; meet established quality standards; and comply with applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, exceptions, or exclusions as otherwise set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under Sec. 199.4(b), covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by a hospital or other authorized institutional provider. Such billings must be fully itemized and sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Depending on the individual circumstances, teaching physician services may be considered an institutional benefit in accordance with Sec. 199.4(b) or a professional benefit under Sec. 199.4(c). See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the CHAMPUS requirements regarding teaching physicians. In the case of continuous care, claims shall be submitted to the appropriate

CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor or, on a participating basis, directly by the facility on behalf of the beneficiary (refer to Sec. 199.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Successive inpatient admissions. Successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the active duty dependent's share of the inpatient institutional charges, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions, except that successive inpatient admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions. For the purpose of applying benefits, successive admissions will be determined separately for maternity admissions and admissions related to an accidental injury (refer to Sec. 199.4(f)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related services and supplies. Covered services and supplies must be rendered in connection with and related directly to a covered diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms requiring otherwise authorized medically necessary treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Inpatient, appropriate level required. For purposes of inpatient care, the level of institutional care for which Basic Program benefits may be extended must be at the appropriate level required to provide the medically necessary treatment except for patients requiring skilled nursing facility care. For patients for whom skilled nursing facility care is adequate, but is not available in the general locality, benefits may be continued in the higher level care facility. General locality means an area that includes all the skilled nursing facilities within 50 miles of the higher level facility, unless the higher level facility can demonstrate that the skilled nursing facilities are inaccessible to its patients. The decision as to whether a skilled nursing facility is within the higher level facility's general locality, or the skilled nursing facility is inaccessible to the higher level facility's patients shall be a CHAMPUS contractor initial determination for the purposes of appeal under Sec. 199.10 of this part. CHAMPUS institutional benefit payments shall be limited to the allowable cost that would have been incurred in the skilled nursing facility, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. If it is determined that the institutional care can be provided reasonably in the home setting, no CHAMPUS institutional benefits are payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> General or special education not covered. Services and supplies related to the provision of either regular or special education generally are not covered. Such exclusion applies whether a separate charge is made for education or whether it is included as a part of an overall combined daily charge of an institution. In the latter instance, that portion of the overall combined daily charge related to education must be determined, based on the allowable costs of the educational component, and deleted from the institution's charges before CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. The only exception is when appropriate education is not available from or not payable by the cognizant public entity. Each case must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Covered hospital services and supplies--(i) Room and board.

Includes sera, biologicals, and pharmaceutical preparations (including insulin) that are listed in the official formularies of the institution or facility at the time of use. (To be considered as an inpatient supply, drugs and medicines must be consumed during the specific period the beneficiary is a registered inpatient. Drugs and medicines prescribed for use outside the hospital, even though prescribed and obtained while

still a registered inpatient, will be considered outpatient supplies and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section will apply.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings. Includes durable medical equipment, medical supplies essential to a surgical procedure (such as artificial heart valve and artificial ball and socket joint), sterile trays, casts, and orthopedic hardware. Use of durable medical equipment is restricted to an inpatient basis.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If durable medical equipment is to be used on an outpatient basis or continued in outpatient status after use as an inpatient, benefits will be provided as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and cost-sharing will be on an outpatient basis (refer to paragraph (a)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Diagnostic services. Includes clinical laboratory examinations, x-ray examinations, pathological examinations, and machine tests that produce hard-copy results.

When required by the diagnosis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Renal and peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. Covered services in SNFs are the same as provided under Medicare under section 1861(h) and (i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(h) and (i)) and 42 CFR part 409, subparts C and D, except that the Medicare limitation on the number of days of coverage under

section 1812(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395d(a) and (b)) and 42 CFR 409.61(b) shall not be applicable under TRICARE. Skilled nursing facility care for each spell of illness shall continue to be provided for as long as medically necessary and appropriate. For a SNF admission to be covered under TRICARE, the beneficiary must have a qualifying hospital stay meaning an inpatient hospital stay of three consecutive days or more, not including the hospital leave day. The beneficiary must enter the SNF within 30 days of leaving the hospital, or within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, where the individual's condition is such that SNF care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital. The skilled services must be for a medical condition that was either treated during the qualifying three-day hospital stay, or started while the beneficiary was already receiving covered SNF care. Additionally, an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a SNF, if within 30 days after discharge from a SNF, the individual is again admitted to a SNF. Adoption by TRICARE of most Medicare coverage standards does not include Medicare coinsurance amounts. Extended care services furnished to an inpatient of a SNF by such SNF (except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(xiv)(C), (b)(3)(xiv)(F), and (b)(3)(xiv)(G) of this section) include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Bed and board in connection with the furnishing of such nursing care;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services furnished by the SNF or by others under arrangements with them by the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Medical social services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Such drugs, biological, supplies, appliances, and equipment, furnished for use in the SNF, as are ordinarily furnished for the care and treatment of inpatients;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of a hospital with which the facility has such an agreement in effect; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Such other services necessary to the health of the patients as are generally provided by SNFs, or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Other medical services.

A room with one bed that is designated as a private room by the hospital or other authorized institutional provider. The allowable cost of a private room accommodation is covered only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When its use is required medically and when the attending physician certifies that a private room is necessary medically for the proper care and treatment of a patient; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a patient's medical condition requires isolation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a patient (in need of immediate inpatient care but not requiring a private room) is admitted to a hospital or other authorized institution that has semiprivate accommodations, but at the time of admission, such accommodations are occupied; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a patient is admitted to an acute care hospital (general or special) without semiprivate rooms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Duration of private room stay. The allowable cost of private accommodations is covered under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section until the patient's condition no longer requires the private room for medical reasons or medical isolation; or, in the case of the patient not requiring a private room, when a semiprivate accommodation becomes available; or, in the case of an acute care hospital (general or special) which does not have semiprivate rooms, for the duration of an otherwise covered inpatient stay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other authorized institutional provider without semiprivate accommodations. When a beneficiary is admitted to a hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other institution that has no semiprivate accommodations, for any inpatient day when the patient qualifies for use of a private room (as set forth in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B) (1) and (2) of this section) the allowable cost of private accommodations is covered.

General staff nursing services cover all nursing care (other than that provided by private duty nurses) including, but not limited to, general duty nursing, emergency room nursing, recovery room nursing, intensive nursing care, and group nursing arrangements. Only nursing services provided by nursing personnel on the payroll of the hospital or other authorized institution are eligible under paragraph (b) of this section. If a nurse who is not on the payroll of the hospital or other authorized institution is called in specifically to care for a single patient (individual nursing) or more than one patient (group nursing), whether the patient is billed for the nursing services directly or through the hospital or other institution, such services constitute private duty (special) nursing services and are not eligible for benefits under this

paragraph (the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(xv) of this section would apply).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ICU. An ICU is a special segregated unit of a hospital in which patients are concentrated, by reason of serious illness, usually without regard to diagnosis. Special lifesaving techniques and equipment are available regularly and immediately within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type of patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing, rather than an intermittent or temporary, basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room or a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be refined further for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment rooms. Standard treatment rooms include emergency rooms, operating rooms, recovery rooms, special treatment rooms, and hyperbaric chambers and all related necessary medical staff and equipment. To be recognized for purposes of CHAMPUS, treatment rooms must be so designated and maintained by the hospital or other authorized institutions on a continuing basis. A treatment room set up on an intermittent or temporary basis would not be so recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Drugs and medicines. Drugs and medicines are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> They represent a cost to the facility rendering treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> They are furnished to a patient receiving treatment, and are related directly to that treatment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> They are ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of inpatients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings. Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of patients; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If specifically related to, and in connection with, the condition for which the patient is being treated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If ordinarily furnished to a patient for use in the hospital or other authorized institution (except in the case of a temporary or disposable item); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Use of durable medical equipment is limited to those items provided while the patient is an inpatient. If such equipment is provided for use on an outpatient basis, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Transitional use items. Under certain circumstances, a temporary or disposable item may be provided for use beyond an inpatient stay, when such item is necessary medically to permit or facilitate the patient's departure from the hospital or other authorized institution, or which may be required until such time as the patient can obtain a continuing supply; or it would be unreasonable or impossible from a medical standpoint to discontinue the patient's use of the item at the time of termination of his or her stay as an inpatient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Anesthetics and oxygen. Anesthetics and oxygen and their administration are considered a service or supply if furnished by the hospital or other authorized institution, or by others under arrangements made by the facility under which the billing for such services is made through the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inpatient mental health services. Inpatient mental health services are those services furnished by institutional and professional providers for treatment of a nervous or mental disorder (as defined in Sec. 199.2) to a patient admitted to a CHAMPUS-authorized acute care general hospital; a psychiatric hospital; or, unless otherwise exempted, a special institutional provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity. In determining the medical or psychological necessity of acute inpatient mental health services, the evaluation conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) shall consider the appropriate level of

care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care. The purpose of such acute inpatient care is to stabilize a life-threatening or severely disabling condition within the context of a brief, intensive model of inpatient care in order to permit management of the patient's condition at a less intensive level of care. Such care is appropriate only if the patient requires services of an intensity and nature that are generally recognized as being effectively and safely provided only in an acute inpatient hospital setting. In addition to the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b)(6) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). Acute inpatient care shall not be considered necessary unless the patient needs to be observed and assessed on a 24-hour basis by skilled nursing staff, and/or requires continued intervention by a multidisciplinary treatment team; and in addition, at least one of the following criteria is determined to be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Patient poses a serious risk of harm to self and/or others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Patient is in need of high dosage, intensive medication or somatic and/or psychological treatment, with potentially serious side effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Patient has acute disturbances of mood, behavior, or thinking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Emergency admissions. Admission to an acute inpatient hospital setting may be on an emergency or on a non-emergency basis. In order for an admission to qualify as an emergency, the following criteria, in addition to those in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The patient must be at immediate risk of serious harm to self and or others based on a psychiatric evaluation performed by a physician (or other qualified mental health professional with hospital admission authority); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The patient requires immediate continuous skilled observation and treatment at the acute psychiatric level of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Preauthorization requirements. (A) With the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii)(E) of this section, all non-emergency admissions to an acute inpatient hospital level of care must be authorized prior to the admission. The criteria for preauthorization shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of preauthorization review, special emphasis is placed on the development of a specific individualized treatment plan, consistent with those criteria and reasonably expected to be effective, for that individual patient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii)(E) of this section, all non-emergency admissions to an acute inpatient hospital level of care must be authorized prior to the admission.

In general, the decision regarding preauthorization shall be made within one business day of receipt of a request for preauthorization, and shall be followed with written confirmation. In the case of an authorization issued after an admission resulting from approval of a request made prior to the

admission, the effective date of the certification shall be the date of the receipt of the request. However, if the request on which the approved authorization is based was made after the admission (and the case was not an emergency admission), the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Authorization prior to admission is not required in the case of a psychiatric emergency requiring an inpatient acute level of care, but authorization for a continuation of services must be obtained promptly. Admissions resulting from a bona fide psychiatric emergency should be reported within 24 hours of the admission or the next business day after the admission, but must be reported to the Director, OCHAMPUS or a designee, within 72 hours of the admission. In the case of an emergency admission authorization resulting from approval of a request made within 72 hours of the admission, the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of the admission. However, if it is determined that the case was not a bona fide psychiatric emergency admission (but the admission can be authorized as medically or psychologically necessary), the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of the receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Concurrent review. Concurrent review of the necessity for continued stay will be conducted. The criteria for concurrent review shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of concurrent review, special emphasis is placed on evaluating the progress being made in the active clinical treatment being provided and on developing/refining appropriate discharge plans. In general, the decision regarding concurrent review shall be made within one business day of the review, and shall be followed with written confirmation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Emergency inpatient hospital services. In the case of a medical emergency, benefits can be extended for medically necessary inpatient services and supplies provided to a beneficiary by a hospital, including hospitals that do not meet CHAMPUS standards or comply with the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act, or satisfy other conditions herein set forth. In a medical emergency, medically necessary inpatient services and supplies are those that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of the patient, and that, because of the threat to the life or health of the patient, necessitate, the use of the most accessible hospital available and equipped to furnish such services. The availability of benefits depends upon the following three separate findings and continues only as long as the emergency exists, as determined by medical review. If the case qualified as an emergency at the time of admission to an unauthorized institutional provider and the emergency subsequently is determined no longer to exist, benefits will be extended up through the date of notice to the beneficiary and provider that CHAMPUS benefits no longer are payable in that hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Existence of medical emergency.

that reasonably can be accomplished within the time frame of the additional days of coverage requested under the waiver provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For patients in care at the time the partial hospitalization program limit is reached, a waiver must be requested prior to the limit. For patients being preadmitted after having received 60 days in the fiscal year, the waiver review will be conducted at the time of the preadmission authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Services and supplies. The following services and supplies are included in the per diem rate approved for an authorized partial hospitalization program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Board. Includes use of the partial hospital facilities such as food service, supervised therapeutically constructed recreational and social activities, and other general services as considered appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Patient assessment. Includes the assessment of each individual accepted by the facility, and must, at a minimum, consist of a physical examination; psychiatric examination; psychological assessment; assessment of physiological, biological and cognitive processes; developmental assessment; family history and assessment; social history and assessment; educational or vocational history and assessment; environmental assessment; and recreational/activities assessment. Assessments conducted within 30 days prior to admission to a partial program may be used if approved and deemed adequate to permit treatment planning by the partial hospital program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Psychological testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Treatment services. All services, supplies, equipment and space necessary to fulfill the requirements of each patient's individualized diagnosis and treatment plan (with the exception of the five psychotherapy sessions per week which may be allowed separately for individual or family psychotherapy based upon the provisions of paragraph (b)(10)(vii) of this section). All mental health services must be provided by a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider of mental health services. [Exception: PHPs that employ individuals with master's or doctoral level degrees in a mental health discipline who do not meet the licensure, certification and experience requirements for a qualified mental health provider but are actively working toward licensure or certification, may provide services within the all-inclusive per diem rate but the individual must work under the clinical supervision of a fully qualified mental health provider employed by the PHP.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Social services required. The facility must provide an active social services component which assures the patient appropriate living arrangements after treatment hours, transportation to and from the facility, arrangement of community based support services, referral of suspected child abuse to the appropriate state agencies, and effective after care arrangements, at a minimum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Educational services required. Programs treating children and adolescents must ensure the provision of a state certified educational component which assures that patients do not fall behind in educational placement while receiving partial hospital treatment. CHAMPUS will not fund the cost of educational services separately from the per diem rate. The hours devoted to education do not count toward the therapeutic half or full day program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Family therapy required. The facility must ensure the provision of an active family therapy treatment component which assures that each patient and family participate at least weekly in family therapy provided by the institution and rendered by a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider of mental health services. There is no acceptable substitute for family therapy. An exception to this requirement may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, only if family therapy is clinically contraindicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Professional mental health benefits limited. Professional mental health benefits are limited to a maximum of one session (60 minutes individual, 90 minutes family) per authorized treatment day not to exceed five sessions in any calendar week. These may be billed separately from the partial hospitalization per diem rate only when rendered by an attending, CHAMPUS-authorized

mental health professional who is not an employee of, or under contract with, the partial hospitalization program for purposes of providing clinical patient care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Non-mental health related medical services. Separate billing will be allowed for otherwise covered, non-mental health related medical services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Professional services benefit--(1) General. Benefits may be extended for those covered services described in paragraph (c) of this section that are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by physicians or other authorized individual professional providers, as set forth in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, exceptions, limitations, or exclusions as maybe otherwise set forth in this or other Sections of this part. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, to be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, the described services must be rendered by a physician, or prescribed, ordered, and referred medically by a physician to other authorized individual professional providers. Further, except under specifically defined circumstances, there should be an attending physician in any episode of care. (For example, certain services of a clinical psychologist are exempt from this requirement. For these exceptions, refer to Sec. 199.6.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Benefits may be extended for those covered services described in paragraph (c) of this section that are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by physicians or other authorized individual professional providers, as set forth in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, exceptions, limitations, or exclusions as maybe otherwise set forth in this or other Sections of this part.

(For example, certain services of a clinical psychologist are exempt from this requirement. For these exceptions, refer to Sec. 199.6.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, covered professional services must be performed personally by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider, who is other than a salaried or contractual staff member of a hospital or other authorized institution, and who ordinarily and customarily bills on a fee-for-service basis for professional services rendered. Such billings must be itemized fully and be sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the requirements regarding the special circumstances for teaching physicians. For continuing professional care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor, or directly by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on behalf of a beneficiary (refer to Sec. 199.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Services must be related. Covered professional services must be rendered in connection with and directly related to a covered diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms requiring medically necessary treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Covered services of physicians and other authorized profession providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Surgery. Surgery means operative procedures, including related preoperative and postoperative care; reduction of fractures and dislocations; injection and needling procedures of the joints; laser surgery of the eye; and the following procedures:
BronchoscopyLaryngoscopyThoracoscopyCatheterization of the heartArteriograph thoracic lumbarEsophagoscopyGastroscopyProctoscopySigmoidoscopyPeritoneoscopyCystoscopyColonscopyUpper G.I. panendoscopyEncephalographMyelographyDiscographyVisualization of intracranial aneurysm by intracarotid injection of dye, with exposure of carotid artery, unilateralVentriculographyInsufflation of uterus and fallopian tubes for determination of tubal patency (Rubin's test of injection of radiopaque medium or for dilation)Introduction of opaque media into the cranial arterial system, preliminary to cerebral arteriography, or into vertebral and subclavian systemsIntraspinal introduction of air preliminary to pneumoencephalographyIntraspinal introduction of opaque media preliminary to myelographyIntraventricular introduction of air preliminary to ventriculography</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine such additional procedures that may fall within the intent of this definition of ``surgery.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Surgical assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inpatient medical services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Outpatient medical services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Psychiatric services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Consultation services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Anesthesia services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Radiation therapy services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> X-ray services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Laboratory and pathological services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Physical medicine services or physiatry services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Maternity care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Well-child care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Other medical care. Other medical care includes, but is not limited to, hemodialysis, inhalation therapy, shock therapy, and chemotherapy. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine those additional medical services for which benefits may be extended under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A separate professional charge for the oral administration of approved antineoplastic drugs is not covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Routine eye examinations. Coverage for routine eye examinations is limited to dependents of active duty members, to one examination per calendar year per person, and to services rendered on or after October 1, 1984, except as provided under paragraph (c)(3)(xi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Extent of professional benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiple Surgery. In cases of multiple surgical procedures performed during the same operative session, benefits shall be extended as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One hundred (100) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for the major surgical procedure (the procedure for which the greatest amount is payable under the applicable reimbursement method); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fifty (50) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for each of the other surgical procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the multiple surgical procedures include an incidental procedure, no benefits shall be allowed for the incidental procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the multiple surgical procedures involve specific procedures identified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, benefits shall be limited as set forth in CHAMPUS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Different types of inpatient care, concurrent. If a beneficiary receives inpatient medical care during the same admission in which he or she also receives surgical care or maternity care, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the greater of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for either the inpatient medical care or surgical or maternity care received, as the case may be, but not both; except that the provisions of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) shall not apply if such inpatient medical care is for a diagnosed condition requiring inpatient medical care not related to the condition for which surgical care or maternity care is received, and is received from a physician other than the one rendering the surgical care or maternity care.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This provision is not meant to imply that when extra time and special effort are required due to postsurgical or postdelivery complications, the attending physician may not request special consideration for a higher than usual charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Need for surgical assistance. Surgical assistance is payable only when the complexity of the procedure warrants a surgical assistant (other than the surgical nurse or other such operating room personnel), subject to utilization review. In order for benefits to be extended for surgical assistance service, the primary surgeon may be required to certify in writing to the nonavailability of a qualified intern, resident, or other house physician. When a claim is received for a surgical assistant involving the following circumstances, special review is required to ascertain whether the surgical assistance service meets the medical necessity and other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the surgical assistance occurred in a hospital that has a residency program in a specialty appropriate to the surgery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the surgery was performed by a team of surgeons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If there were multiple surgical assistants; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the surgical assistant was a partner of or from the same group of practicing physicians as the attending surgeon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Aftercare following surgery. Except for those diagnostic procedures classified as surgery in paragraph (c) of this

section, and injection and needling procedures involving the joints, the benefit payments made for surgery (regardless of the setting in which it is rendered) include normal aftercare, whether the aftercare is billed for by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on a global, all-inclusive basis, or billed for separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Cast and sutures, removal. The benefit payments made for the application of a cast or of sutures normally covers the postoperative care including the removal of the cast or sutures. When the application is made in one geographical location and the removal of the cast or sutures must be done in another geographical location, a separate benefit payment may be provided for the removal. The intent of this provision is to provide a separate benefit only when it is impracticable for the beneficiary to use the services of the provider that applied the cast originally. Benefits are not available for the services of a second provider if those services reasonably could have been rendered by the individual professional provider who applied the cast or sutures initially.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Inpatient care, concurrent. Concurrent inpatient care by more than one individual professional provider is covered if required because of the severity and complexity of the beneficiary's condition or because the beneficiary has multiple conditions that require treatment by providers of different specialties. Any claim for concurrent care must be reviewed before extending benefits in order to ascertain the condition of the beneficiary at the time the concurrent care was rendered. In the absence of such determination, benefits are payable only for inpatient care rendered by one attending physician or other authorized individual professional provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Consultants who become the attending surgeon. A consultation performed within 3 days of surgery by the attending physician is considered a preoperative examination. Preoperative examinations are an integral part of the surgery and a separate benefit is not payable for the consultation. If more than 3 days elapse between the consultation and surgery (performed by the same physician), benefits may be extended for the consultation, subject to review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Anesthesia administered by the attending physician. A separate benefit is not payable for anesthesia administered by the attending physician (surgeon or obstetrician) or dentist, or by the surgical, obstetrical, or dental assistant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Treatment of mental disorders. CHAMPUS benefits for the treatment of mental disorders are payable for beneficiaries who are outpatients or inpatients of CHAMPUS-authorized general or psychiatric hospitals, RTCs, or specialized treatment facilities, as authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such services are subject to review for medical or psychological necessity and for quality of care. The Director, OCHAMPUS, reserves the right to require preauthorization of mental health services. Preauthorization may be conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. In order to qualify for CHAMPUS mental health benefits, the patient must be diagnosed by a CHAMPUS-authorized licensed, qualified mental health professional to be suffering from a mental disorder, according to the criteria listed in the most current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which may be purchased from the American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1400 K Street, NW., suite 1101, Washington, DC 20005. Benefits are limited for certain mental disorders, such as specific developmental disorders. No benefits are payable for ``Conditions Not Attributable to a Mental Disorder,'' or V codes. In order for treatment of a mental disorder to be medically or psychologically necessary, the patient must, as a result of a diagnosed mental disorder, be experiencing both physical or psychological distress and an impairment in his or her ability to function in appropriate occupational, educational or social roles. It is generally the degree to which the patient's ability to function is impaired that determines the level of care (if any) required to treat the patient's condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Covered diagnostic and therapeutic services. Subject to the requirements

and limitations stated, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for the following services when rendered in the diagnosis or treatment of a covered mental disorder by a CHAMPUS-authorized, qualified mental health provider practicing within the scope of his or her license. Qualified mental health providers are: Psychiatrists or other physicians; clinical psychologists, certified psychiatric nurse specialists, certified clinical social workers, certified marriage and family therapists, TRICARE certified mental health counselors, pastoral counselors under a physician's supervision and supervised mental health counselors under a physician's supervision. No payment will be made for any service listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ix)(A) of this section rendered by an individual who does not meet the criteria of Sec. 199.6 for his or her respective profession, regardless of whether the provider is an independent professional provider or an employee of an authorized professional or institutional provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitations and review requirements--(1) Outpatient psychotherapy. Outpatient psychotherapy generally is limited to a maximum of two psychotherapy sessions per week, in any combination of individual, family, conjoint, collateral, or group sessions. Before benefits can be extended for more than two outpatient psychotherapy sessions per week, professional review of the medical or psychological necessity for and appropriateness of the more intensive therapy is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inpatient psychotherapy. Coverage of inpatient psychotherapy is based on medical or psychological necessity for the services identified in the patient's treatment plan. As a general rule, up to five psychotherapy sessions per week are considered appropriate when specified in the treatment as necessary to meet certain measurable/observable goals and objectives. Additional sessions per week or more than one type of psychotherapy sessions performed on the same day (for example, an individual psychotherapy session and a family psychotherapy session on the same day) could be considered for coverage, depending on the medical or psychological necessity for the services. Benefits for inpatient psychotherapy will end automatically when authorization has been granted for the maximum number of inpatient mental health days in accordance with the limits as described in this section, unless additional coverage is granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Covered ancillary therapies. Includes art, music, dance, occupational, and other ancillary therapies, when included by the attending provider in an approved inpatient, residential treatment plan and under the clinical supervision of a licensed doctoral level mental health professional. These ancillary therapies are not separately reimbursed professional services but are included within the institutional reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Review of claims for treatment of mental disorder. The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall establish and maintain procedures for review, including professional review, of the services provided for the treatment of mental disorders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Physical and occupational therapy. Assessment and treatment services of a CHAMPUS-authorized physical or occupational therapist may be cost-shared when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The services are prescribed and monitored by a physician, certified physician assistant or certified nurse practitioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The purpose of the prescription is to reduce the disabling effects of an illness, injury, or neuromuscular disorder; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The prescribed treatment increases, stabilizes, or slows the deterioration of the beneficiary's ability to perform specified purposeful activity in the manner, or within the range considered normal, for a human being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Well-child care. Benefits routinely are covered for well-child care from birth to under six years of age. These periodic health examinations are designed for prevention, early detection and treatment of disease and consist of screening procedures, immunizations and risk counseling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The following services are covered when required as a part of the specific well-child care program and when rendered by the attending pediatrician,

family physician, certified nurse practitioner, or certified physician assistant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Newborn examination, heredity and metabolic screening, and newborn circumcision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodic health supervision visits, in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, intended to promote the optimal health for infants and children to include the following services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> History and physical examination and mental health assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vision, hearing, and dental screening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Developmental appraisal to include body measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Immunizations as recommenced by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pediatric risk assessment for lead exposure and blood lead level test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tuberculosis screening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Blood pressure screening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit for anemia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Urinalysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Health guidance and counseling, including breastfeeding and nutrition counseling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional services or visits required because of specific findings or because the particular circumstances of the individual case are covered if medically necessary and otherwise authorized for benefits under CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Services Financing, will determine when such services are separately reimbursable apart from the health supervision visit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Physicians in a teaching setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Teaching physicians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The services of teaching physicians may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only when the teaching physician has established an attending physician relationship between the teaching physician and the patient or when the teaching physician provides distinct, identifiable, personal services (e.g., services rendered as a consultant, assistant surgeon, etc.). Attending physician services may include both direct patient care services or direct supervision of care provided by a physician in training. In order to be considered an attending physician, the teaching physician must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review the patient's history and the record of examinations and tests in the institution, and make frequent reviews of the patient's progress; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Personally examine the patient; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iiii)</em> Confirm or revise the diagnosis and determine the course of treatment to be followed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Either perform the physician's services required by the patient or supervise the treatment so as to assure that appropriate services are provided by physicians in training and that the care meets a proper quality level; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Be present and ready to perform any service performed by an attending physician in a nonteaching setting when a major surgical procedure or a complex or dangerous medical procedure is performed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Be personally responsible for the patient's care, at least throughout the period of hospitalization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Direct supervision by an attending physician of care provided by physicians in training. Payment on the basis of allowable charges may be made for the professional services rendered to a beneficiary by his/her attending physician when the attending physician provides personal and identifiable direction to physicians in training who are participating in the care of the patient. It is not necessary that the attending physician be personally present for all services, but the attending physician must be on the provider's premises and available to provide immediate personal assistance and direction if needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual, personal services. A teaching physician may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis for any individual, identifiable service rendered to a CHAMPUS beneficiary, so long as the service is a covered service and is normally reimbursed separately, and so long as the patient records substantiate the service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Who may bill. The services of a teaching physician must be billed by the institutional provider when the physician is employed by the provider or a related entity or under a contract which provides for payment to the physician by the provider or a related entity. Where the teaching physician has

no relationship with the provider (except for standard physician privileges to admit patients) and generally treats patients on a fee-for-service basis in the private sector, the teaching physician may submit claims under his/her own provider number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Physicians in training. Physicians in training in an approved teaching program are considered to be ``students'' and may not be reimbursed directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are provided as part of their employment (either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider. Services of physicians in training may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The physician in training is fully licensed to practice medicine by the state in which the services are performed, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The services are rendered outside the scope and requirements of the approved training program to which the physician in training is assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other benefits--(1) General. Benefits may be extended for the allowable charge of those other covered services and supplies described in paragraph (d) of this section, which are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by those other authorized providers described in Sec. 199.6. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions as otherwise may be set forth in this or other chapters of this Regulation. To be considered for benefits under paragraph (d) of this section, the described services or supplies must be prescribed and ordered by a physician. Other authorized individual professional providers acting within their scope of licensure may also prescribe and order these services and supplies unless otherwise specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Benefits may be extended for the allowable charge of those other covered services and supplies described in paragraph (d) of this section, which are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by those other authorized providers described in Sec. 199.6. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions as otherwise may be set forth in this or other chapters of this Regulation.

To be considered for benefits under paragraph (d) of this section, covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by an authorized provider as set forth in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Such billing must be itemized fully and described sufficiently, even when CHAMPUS payment is determined under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, so that CHAMPUS can determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Except for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, whenever continuing charges are involved, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days (monthly) either by the beneficiary or sponsor or directly by the provider. For claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, claims may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other covered services and supplies--(i) Blood. If whole blood or plasma (or its derivatives) are provided and billed for by an authorized institution in connection with covered treatment, benefits are extended as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

If whole blood or plasma (or its derivatives) are provided and billed for by an authorized institution in connection with covered treatment, benefits are extended as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If blood is billed for directly to a beneficiary, benefits may be extended under paragraph (d) in the same manner as a medical supply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Durable equipment--(A) Scope of benefit. (1) Durable equipment, which is for the specific use of the beneficiary and is ordered by an authorized individual professional provider listed in Sec. 199.6(c)(3)(i), (ii) or (iii), acting within his or her scope of licensure shall be covered if the durable equipment meets the definition in Sec. 199.2 and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provides the medically appropriate level of performance and quality for the medical condition present and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is not otherwise excluded by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Items that may be provided to a beneficiary as durable equipment include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Durable medical equipment as defined in Sec. 199.2;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Wheelchairs. A wheelchair, which is medically appropriate to provide basic mobility, including reasonable additional costs for medically appropriate modifications to accommodate a particular physiological or medical need, may be covered as durable equipment. An electric wheelchair, or TRICARE approved alternative to an electric wheelchair (e.g., scooter) may be provided in lieu of a manual wheelchair when it is medically indicated and appropriate to provide basic mobility. Luxury or deluxe wheelchairs, as

described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A)(3) of this section, include features beyond those required for basic mobility of a particular beneficiary are not authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Iron lungs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Hospital beds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Cardiorespiratory monitors under conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether a prescribed item of durable equipment provides the medically appropriate level of performance and quality for the beneficiary's condition must be supported by adequate documentation. Luxury, deluxe, immaterial, or non-essential features, which increase the cost of the item relative to a similar item without those features, based on industry standards for a particular item at the time the equipment is prescribed or replaced for a beneficiary, are not authorized. Only the ``base'' or ``basic'' model of equipment (or more cost-effective alternative equipment) shall be covered, unless customization of the equipment, or any accessory or item of supply for any durable equipment, is essential, as determined by the Director (or designee), for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Achieving therapeutic benefit for the patient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Making the equipment serviceable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise assuring the proper functioning of the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medical supplies and dressings (consumables). Medical supplies and dressings (consumables) are those that do not withstand prolonged, repeated use. Such items must be related directly to an appropriate and verified covered medical condition of the specific beneficiary for whom the item was purchased and obtained from a medical supply company, a pharmacy, or authorized institutional provider. Examples of covered medical supplies and dressings are disposable syringes for a known diabetic, colostomy sets, irrigation sets, and elastic bandages. An external surgical garment specifically designed for use following a mastectomy is considered a medical supply item.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Generally, the allowable charge of a medical supply item will be under $100. Any item over this amount must be reviewed to determine whether it would not qualify as a DME item. If it is, in fact, a medical supply item and does not represent an excessive charge, it can be considered for benefits under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Oxygen. Oxygen and equipment for its administration are covered. Benefits are limited to providing a tank unit at one location with oxygen limited to a 30-day supply at any one time. Repair and adjustment of CHAMPUS-purchased oxygen equipment also is covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ambulance. Civilian ambulance service is covered when medically necessary in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies and a covered medical condition. For the purpose of TRICARE payment, ambulance service is an outpatient service (including in connection with maternity care) with the exception of otherwise covered transfers between hospitals which are cost-shared on an inpatient basis. Ambulance transfers from a hospital based emergency room to another hospital more capable of providing the required care will also be cost-shared on an inpatient basis.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The inpatient cost-sharing provisions for ambulance transfers only apply to otherwise covered transfers between hospitals, i.e., acute care, general, and special hospitals; psychiatric hospitals; and long-term hospitals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ambulance service cannot be used instead of taxi service and is not payable when the patient's condition would have permitted use of regular private transportation; nor is it payable when transport or transfer of a patient is primarily for the purpose of having the patient nearer to home, family, friends, or personal physician.

Emergency and inpatient hospital services are covered when medically necessary for the active medical treatment of the acute phases of substance abuse withdrawal (detoxification), for stabilization, and for treatment of medical complications of substance use disorders. Emergency and inpatient hospital services are considered medically necessary only when the patient's condition is such that the personnel and facilities of a hospital are required. Stays provided for substance use disorder rehabilitation in a hospital-based rehabilitation facility are covered, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. Inpatient hospital services also are subject to the provisions regarding the limit on inpatient mental health services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authorized substance use disorder treatment.

Release of any patient identifying information, including that required to adjudicate a claim, must comply with the provisions of section 544 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 290dd-3), which governs the release of medical and other information from the records of patients undergoing treatment of substance abuse. If the patient refuses to authorize the release of medical records which are, in the opinion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, necessary to determine benefits on a claim for treatment of substance abuse the claim will be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Waiver of benefit limits. The specific benefit limits set forth in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS in special cases based on a determination that all of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Active treatment has taken place during the period of the benefit limit and substantial progress has been made according to the plan of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Further progress has been delayed due to the complexity of the illness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Specific evidence has been presented to explain the factors that interfered with further treatment progress during the period of the benefit limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The waiver request includes specific time frames and a specific plan of treatment which will complete the course of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transplants.

A complete explanation, with supporting medical documentation, must be submitted with claims for emergency adjunctive dental care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Covered oral surgery. Notwithstanding the above limitations on dental care, there are certain oral surgical procedures that are performed by both physicians and dentists, and that are essentially medical rather than dental care. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, the following procedures, whether performed by a physician or dentist, are considered to be in this category and benefits may be extended for otherwise covered services and supplies without preauthorization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Excision of tumors and cysts of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth, when such conditions require a pathological (histological) examination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Surgical procedures required to correct accidental injuries of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of oral or facial cancer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Treatment of fractures of facial bones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> External (extra-oral) incision and drainage of cellulitis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Surgery of accessory sinuses, salivary glands, or ducts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Reduction of dislocations and the excision of the temporomandibular joints, when surgery is a necessary part of the reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Any oral surgical procedure that falls within the cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery definition is subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Extraction of unerupted or partially erupted, malposed or impacted teeth, with or without the attached follicular or development tissues, is not a covered oral surgery procedure except when the care is indicated in preparation for medical treatment of a disease or disorder or required as a result of dental trauma caused by the necessary medical treatment of an injury or illness. Surgical preparation of the mouth for dentures is not covered by CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Inpatient hospital stay in connection with non-adjunctive, noncovered dental care. Institutional benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section

may be extended for inpatient hospital stays related to noncovered, nonadjunctive dental care when such inpatient stay is medically necessary to safeguard the life of the patient from the effects of dentistry because of the existence of a specific and serious nondental organic impairment currently under active treatment. (Hemophilia is an example of a condition that could be considered a serious nondental impairment.) Preauthorization by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is required for such inpatient stays to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section. Regardless of whether or not the preauthorization request for the hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the professional service related to the nonadjunctive dental care is not covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Anesthesia and institutional costs for dental care for children and certain other patients. Institutional benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended for hospital and in-out surgery settings related to noncovered, nonadjunctive dental care when such outpatient care or inpatient stay is in conjunction with dental treatment for patients with developmental, mental, or physical disabilities or for pediatric patients age 5 or under. For these patients, anesthesia services will be limited to the administration of general anesthesia only. Patients with developmental, mental, or physical disabilities are those patients with conditions that prohibit dental treatment in a safe and effective manner. Therefore, it is medically or psychologically necessary for these patients to require general anesthesia for dental treatment. Patients with physical disabilities include those patients having disabilities as defined in Sec. 199.2 as a serious physical disability. Preauthorization by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, is required for such outpatient care or inpatient stays to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section. Regardless of whether or not the preauthorization request for outpatient care or hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the professional service related to the nonadjunctive dental care is not covered, with the exception of coverage for anesthesia services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Drug abuse. Under the Basic Program, benefits may be extended for medically necessary prescription drugs required in the treatment of an illness or injury or in connection with maternity care (refer to paragraph (d) of this section). However, TRICARE benefits cannot be authorized to support or maintain an existing or potential drug abuse situation whether or not the drugs (under other circumstances) are eligible for benefit consideration and whether or not obtained by legal means. Drugs, including the substitution of a therapeutic drug with addictive potential for a drug of addiction, prescribed to beneficiaries undergoing medically supervised treatment for a substance use disorder as authorized under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section are not considered to be in support of, or to maintain, an existing or potential drug abuse situation and are allowed. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may prescribe appropriate policies to implement this prescription drug benefit for those undergoing medically supervised treatment for a substance use disorder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limitations on who can prescribe drugs. CHAMPUS benefits are not available for any drugs prescribed by a member of the beneficiary's family or by a nonfamily member residing in the same household with the beneficiary or sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Kinds of prescription drugs that are monitored carefully by CHAMPUS for possible abuse situations--(A) Narcotics. Examples are Morphine and Demerol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Narcotics. Examples are Morphine and Demerol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonnarcotic analgesics. Examples are Talwin and Darvon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tranquilizers. Examples are Valium, Librium, and Meprobamate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Barbiturates. Examples are Seconal and Nembuttal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Nonbarbituate hypnotics. Examples are Doriden and Chloral Hydrate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Stimulants. Examples are amphetamines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary responsibilities. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are responsible for implementing utilization control and quality assurance procedures designed to identify possible drug abuse situations. The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary is directed to screen all drug claims for potential overutilization and irrational prescribing of drugs, and to subject any such cases to extensive review to establish the necessity for the drugs and their appropriateness on the basis of diagnosis or definitive symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When a possible drug abuse situation is identified, all claims for drugs for that specific beneficiary or provider will be suspended pending the results of a review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the review determines that a drug abuse situation does in fact exist, all drug claims held in suspense will be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the record indicates previously paid drug benefits, the prior claims for that beneficiary or provider will be reopened and the circumstances involved reviewed to determine whether or not drug abuse also existed at the time the earlier claims were adjudicated. If drug abuse is later ascertained, benefit payments made previously will be considered to have been extended in error and the amounts so paid recouped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Inpatient stays primarily for the purpose of obtaining drugs and any other services and supplies related to drug abuse also are excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Unethical or illegal provider practices related to drugs. Any such investigation into a possible drug abuse that uncovers unethical or illegal drug dispensing practices on the part of an institution, a pharmacy, or physician will be referred to the professional or investigative agency having jurisdiction. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are directed to withhold payment of all CHAMPUS claims for services and supplies rendered by a provider under active investigation for possible unethical or illegal drug dispensing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Detoxification. The above monitoring and control of drug abuse situations shall in no way be construed to deny otherwise covered medical services and supplies related to drug detoxification (including newborn, addicted infants) when medical supervision is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Domiciliary care. The statute under which CHAMPUS operates also specifically excludes domiciliary care (refer to Sec. 199.2 of this part for the definition of ``Domiciliary Care'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples of domiciliary care situations. The following are examples of domiciliary care for which CHAMPUS benefits are not payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Home care is not available. Institutionalization primarily because parents work, or extension of a hospital stay beyond what is medically necessary because the patient lives alone, are examples of domiciliary care provided because there is no other family member or other person available in the home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Home care is not suitable. Institutionalization of a child because a parent (or parents) is an alcoholic who is not responsible enough to care for the child, or because someone in the home has a contagious disease, are examples of domiciliary care being provided because the home setting is unsuitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Family unwilling to care for a person in the home. A child who is difficult to manage may be placed in an institution, not because institutional care is medically necessary, but because the family does not want to handle him or her in the home. Such institutionalization would represent domiciliary care, that is, the family being unwilling to assume responsibility for the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benefits available in connection with a domiciliary care case. Should the beneficiary receive otherwise covered medical services or supplies while also being in a domiciliary care situation, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for those medical services or supplies, or both, in the same manner as though the beneficiary resided in his or her own home. Such benefits would be cost-shared as though rendered to an outpatient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> General exclusion. Domiciliary care is institutionalization essentially to provide a substitute home--not because it is medically necessary for the beneficiary to be in the institution (although there may be conditions present that have contributed to the

fact that domiciliary care is being rendered). CHAMPUS benefits are not payable for any costs or charges related to the provision of domiciliary care. While a substitute home or assistance may be necessary for the beneficiary, domiciliary care does not represent the kind of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> CT scanning--(i) Approved CT scan services. Benefits may be extended for medically necessary CT scans of the head or other anatomical regions of the body when all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approved CT scan services. Benefits may be extended for medically necessary CT scans of the head or other anatomical regions of the body when all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The patient is referred for the diagnostic procedure by a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The CT scan procedure is consistent with the preliminary diagnosis or symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other noninvasive and less costly means of diagnosis have been attempted or are not appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The CT scan equipment is licensed or registered by the appropriate state agency responsible for licensing or registering medical equipment that emits ionizing radiation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The CT scan equipment is operated under the general supervision and direction of a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The results of the CT scan diagnostic procedure are interpreted by a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review guidelines and criteria. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will issue specific guidelines and criteria for CHAMPUS coverage of medically necessary head and body part CT scans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Morbid obesity. The TRICARE morbid obesity benefit is limited to those bariatric surgical procedures for which the safety and efficacy has been proven comparable or superior to conventional therapies and is consistent with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States medical community. (See the definition of reliable evidence in Sec. 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conditions for coverage. (A) Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in Sec. 199.2(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in Sec. 199.2(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Covered bariatric surgical procedures are payable only when the patient has completed growth (18 years of age or documentation of completion of bone growth) and has met one of the following selection criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The patient has a BMI that is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m\2\ and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The patient has a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m\2\, has at least one high-risk co-morbid condition associated with morbid obesity, and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Director, TMA, shall issue guidelines for review of the specific high-risk co-morbid conditions, exacerbated or caused by obesity based on the Reliable Evidence Standard as defined in Sec. 199.2 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of complications. (A) Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payment is authorized for otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to complications of obesity when such services and supplies are an integral and necessary part of the course of treatment that was aggravated by the obesity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusions. CHAMPUS payment may not be extended for weight control services, weight control/loss programs, dietary regimens and supplements, appetite suppressants and other medications; food or food supplements, exercise and exercise programs, or other programs and equipment that are primarily intended to control weight or for the purpose of weight reduction, regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Maternity care. (i) Benefit. The CHAMPUS Basic Program may share

the cost of medically necessary services and supplies associated with maternity care which are not otherwise excluded by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefit. The CHAMPUS Basic Program may share

the cost of medically necessary services and supplies associated with maternity care which are not otherwise excluded by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost-share. Maternity care cost-share shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Inpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a hospital inpatient childbirth unit, and for maternity care ending in a non-birth outcome not otherwise excluded by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ambulatory surgery cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a birthing center to which the beneficiary is admitted and from which the beneficiary has received prenatal care, or a hospital-based outpatient birthing room.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Outpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care which terminates in a planned childbirth at home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to ``Complications of pregnancy,'' as defined in Sec. 199.2 of this part, will be cost-shared on the same basis as the related maternity care for a period not to exceed 42 days following termination of the pregnancy and thereafter cost-shared on the basis of the inpatient or outpatient status of the beneficiary when medically necessary services and supplies are received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Biofeedback Therapy. Biofeedback therapy is a technique by which a person is taught to exercise control over a physiologic process occurring within the body. By using modern biomedical instruments the patient learns how a specific physiologic system within his body operates and how to modify the performance of this particular system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefits Provided. CHAMPUS benefits are payable for services and supplies in connection with electrothermal, electromyograph and electrodermal biofeedback therapy when there is documentation that the patient has undergone an appropriate medical evaluation, that their present condition is not responding to or no longer responds to other forms of conventional treatment, and only when provided as treatment for the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Adjunctive treatment for Raynaud's Syndrome.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjunctive treatment for muscle re-education of specific muscle groups or for treating pathological muscle abnormalities of spasticity, or incapacitating muscle spasm or weakness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitations. Payable benefits include initial intake evaluation. Treatment following the initial intake evaluation is limited to a maximum of 20 inpatient and outpatient biofeedback treatments per calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusions. Benefits are excluded for biofeedback therapy for the treatment of ordinary muscle tension states or for psychosomatic conditions. Benefits are also excluded for the rental or purchase of biofeedback equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provider Requirements. A provider of biofeedback therapy must be a CHAMPUS-authorized provider. (Refer to Sec. 199.6, ``Authorized Providers). If biofeedback treatment is provided by other than a physician, the patient must be referred by a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Implementation Guidelines. The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provision of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation is the process by which individuals are restored to their optimal physical, medical, and psychological status, after a cardiac event. Cardiac rehabilitation is often divided into three phases. Phase I begins during inpatient hospitalization and is managed by the patient's personal physician. Phase II is a medically supervised outpatient program which begins following discharge. Phase III is a lifetime maintenance program emphasizing continuation of physical fitness with periodic followup. Each phase includes an exercise component, patient education, and risk factor modification. There may be considerable variation in program components, intensity, and duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefits Provided. CHAMPUS benefits are available on an inpatient or outpatient basis for services and supplies provided in connection with a cardiac rehabilitation program when ordered by a physician and provided as treatment for patients who have experienced the following cardiac events

within the preceding twelve (12) months:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Myocardial Infarction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Coronary Angioplasty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Chronic Stable Angina (see limitations below).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Heart valve surgery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Heart or Heart-lung Transplantation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitations. Payable benefits include separate allowance for the initial evaluation and testing. Outpatient treatment following the initial intake evaluation and testing is limited to a maximum of thirty-six (36) sessions per cardiac event, usually provided 3 sessions per week for twelve (12) weeks. Patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina are limited to one treatment episode (36 sessions) in a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusions. Phase III cardiac rehabilitation lifetime maintenance programs performed at home or in medically unsupervised settings are not covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Providers. A provider of cardiac rehabilitation services must be a TRICARE authorized hospital (see Sec. 199.6 (b)(4)(i)) or a freestanding cardiac rehabilitation facility that meets the requirements of Sec. 199.6 (f). All cardiac rehabilitation services must be ordered by a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Payment. Payment for outpatient treatment will be based on an all inclusive allowable charge per session. Inpatient treatment will be paid based upon the reimbursement system in place for the hospital where the services are rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Implementation Guidelines. The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Hospice care. Hospice care is a program which provides an integrated set of services and supplies designed to care for the terminally ill. This type of care emphasizes palliative care and supportive services, such as pain control and home care, rather than cure-oriented services provided in institutions that are otherwise the primary focus under CHAMPUS. The benefit provides coverage for a humane and sensible approach to care during the last days of life for some terminally ill patients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefit coverage. CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are terminally ill (that is, a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease runs its normal course) will be eligible for the following services and supplies in lieu of most other CHAMPUS benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Physician services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Medical social services provided by a social worker who has at least a bachelor's degree from a school accredited or approved by the Council on Social Work Education, and who is working under the direction of a physician. Medical social services include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assessment of social and emotional factors related to the beneficiary's illness, need for care, response to treatment, and adjustment to care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assessment of the relationship of the beneficiary's medical and nursing requirements to the individual's home situation, financial resources, and availability of community resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate action to obtain available community resources to assist in resolving the beneficiary's problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Counseling services that are required by the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Counseling services provided to the terminally ill individual and the family member or other persons caring for the individual at home. Counseling, including dietary counseling, may be provided both for the purpose of training the individual's family or other care-giver to provide care, and for the purpose of helping the individual and those caring for him or her to adjust to the individual's approaching death. Bereavement counseling, which consists of counseling services provided to the individual's family after the individual's death, is a required hospice service but it is not reimbursable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Home health aide services furnished by qualified aides and homemaker services. Home health aides may provide personal care services. Aides also may perform household services to maintain a safe and sanitary environment in areas of the home

used by the patient. Examples of such services are changing the bed or light cleaning and laundering essential to the comfort and cleanliness of the patient. Aide services must be provided under the general supervision of a registered nurse. Homemaker services may include assistance in personal care, maintenance of a safe and healthy environment, and services to enable the individual to carry out the plan of care. Qualifications for home health aides can be found in 42 CFR 484.36.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Medical appliances and supplies, including drugs and biologicals. Only drugs that are used primarily for the relief of pain and symptom control related to the individual's terminal illness are covered. Appliances may include covered durable medical equipment, as well as other self-help and personal comfort items related to the palliation or management of the patient's condition while he or she is under hospice care. Equipment is provided by the hospice for use in the beneficiary's home while he or she is under hospice care. Medical supplies include those that are part of the written plan of care. Medical appliances and supplies are included within the hospice all-inclusive rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services provided for purposes of symptom control or to enable the individual to maintain activities of daily living and basic functional skills.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Short-term inpatient care provided in a Medicare participating hospice inpatient unit, or a Medicare participating hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF) or, in the case of respite care, a Medicaid-certified nursing facility that additionally meets the special hospice standards regarding staffing and patient areas. Services provided in an inpatient setting must conform to the written plan of care. Inpatient care may be required for procedures necessary for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management. Inpatient care may also be furnished to provide respite for the individual's family or other persons caring for the individual at home. Respite care is the only type of inpatient care that may be provided in a Medicaid-certified nursing facility. The limitations on custodial care and personal comfort items applicable to other CHAMPUS services are not applicable to hospice care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Core services. The hospice must ensure that substantially all core services are routinely provided directly by hospice employees; i.e., physician services, nursing care, medical social services, and counseling for individuals and care givers. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(A), (e)(19)(i)(B), (e)(19)(i)(C), and (e)(19)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Non-core services. While non-core services (i.e., home health aide services, medical appliances and supplies, drugs and biologicals, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and short-term inpatient care) may be provided under arrangements with other agencies or organizations, the hospice must maintain professional management of the patient at all times and in all settings. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(E), (e)(19)(i)(F), (e)(19)(i)(G), and (e)(19)(i)(H) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Availability of services. The hospice must make nursing services, physician services, and drugs and biologicals routinely available on a 24-hour basis. All other covered services must be made available on a 24-hour basis to the extent necessary to meet the needs of individuals for care that is reasonable and necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related condition. These services must be provided in a manner consistent with accepted standards of practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Periods of care. Hospice care is divided into distinct periods of care. The periods of care that may be elected by the terminally ill CHAMPUS beneficiary shall be as the Director, TRICARE determines to be appropriate, but shall not be less than those offered under Medicare's Hospice Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Conditions for coverage. The CHAMPUS beneficiary must meet the following conditions/criteria in order to be eligible for the hospice benefits and services referenced in paragraph (e)(19)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There must be written certification in the medical record that the CHAMPUS beneficiary is terminally ill

with a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timing of certification. The hospice must obtain written certification of terminal illness for each of the election periods described in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(B) of this section, even if a single election continues in effect for two, three or four periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basic requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(A)(1)(ii) of this section the hospice must obtain the written certification no later than two calendar days after the period begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. For the initial 90-day period, if the hospice cannot obtain the written certifications within two calendar days, it must obtain oral certifications within two calendar days, and written certifications no later than eight calendar days after the period begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sources of certification. Physician certification is required for both initial and subsequent election periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the initial 90-day period, the hospice must obtain written certification statements (and oral certification statements if required under paragraph (e)(19(vi)(A)(i)(ii) of this section) from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual's attending physician if the individual has an attending physician; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The medical director of the hospice or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For subsequent periods, the only requirement is certification by one of the physicians listed in paragraph (e)(19)(vi)(A)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terminally ill beneficiary must elect to receive hospice care for each specified period of time; i.e., the two 90-day periods, a subsequent 30-day period, and a final period of unlimited duration. If the individual is found to be mentally incompetent, his or her representative may file the election statement. Representative means an individual who has been authorized under State law to terminate medical care or to elect or revoke the election of hospice care on behalf of a terminally ill individual who is found to be mentally incompetent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The episodes of care must be used consecutively; i.e., the two 90-day periods first, then the 30-day period, followed by the final period. The periods of care may be elected separately at different times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The initial election will continue through subsequent election periods without a break in care as long as the individual remains in the care of the hospice and does not revoke the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The effective date of the election may begin on the first day of hospice care or any subsequent day of care, but the effective date cannot be made prior to the date that the election was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The beneficiary or representative may revoke a hospice election at any time, but in doing so, the remaining days of that particular election period are forfeited and standard CHAMPUS coverage resumes. To revoke the hospice benefit, the beneficiary or representative must file a signed statement of revocation with the hospice.

The TRICARE smoking cessation program is available to all TRICARE beneficiaries who reside in one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia who are not eligible for Medicare benefits authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. In addition, pursuant to Sec. 199.17, if authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the TRICARE smoking cessation program may be implemented in whole or in part in areas outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia for active duty members and their dependents who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime (overseas Prime beneficiaries). In such cases, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to the TRICARE smoking cessation program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the overseas area involved. Notice of the use of this authority, not otherwise mentioned in this paragraph (e)(30), shall be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benefits. There is no requirement for an eligible beneficiary to be diagnosed with a smoking related illness to access benefits under this program.

Products available under this program are identified through the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, consistent with the DoD Uniform Formulary in Sec. 199.21. Smoking cessation pharmaceutical agents, including FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical agents, are available through the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) or the MTF at no cost to the beneficiary. Smoking cessation pharmaceuticals through the TRICARE program will not be available at any retail pharmacies.

Access to a non-medical toll-free quit line 7 days a week, 24 hours a day will be available. The quit line will be staffed with smoking cessation counselors trained to assess a beneficiary's readiness to quit, identify barriers to quitting, and provide specific suggested actions and motivational counseling to enhance the chances of a successful quit attempt. When appropriate, quit line counselors will refer beneficiaries to a TRICARE-authorized provider for medical intervention. The quit line may, at the discretion of the Director, TMA, include the opportunity for the beneficiary to request individual follow-up contact initiated by quit line personnel; however, the beneficiary is not required to participate in the quit line initiated follow-up. Printed educational materials on the effects of tobacco use will be provided to the beneficiary upon request. This benefit may be made available to overseas Prime beneficiaries should the ASD(HA) exercise his authority to do so and provide appropriate notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Web-based resources. Downloadable educational materials on

the effects of tobacco use will be available through the internet or other electronic media.

Eligible beneficiaries are entitled to two quit attempts per year (consecutive 12 month period). A third quit attempt may be covered per year with physician justification and pre-authorization. A quit attempt is defined as up to eighteen face-to-face counseling sessions over a 120 consecutive day period and/or 120 days of pharmacologic intervention for the purpose of smoking cessation. Counseling and pharmacological treatment periods that overlap by at least 60-days are considered a single quit attempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Beneficiary or sponsor liability--(1) General. As stated in the introductory paragraph to this section, the Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. To encourage use of the Uniformed Services direct medical care system wherever its facilities are available and appropriate, the Basic Program benefits are designed so that it is to the financial advantage of a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor to use the direct medical care system. When medical care is received from civilian sources, a CHAMPUS beneficiary is responsible for payment of certain deductible and cost-sharing amounts in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies. By statute, this joint financial responsibility between the beneficiary or sponsor and CHAMPUS is more favorable for dependents of members than for other classes of beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

No deductible shall be applied to allowable amounts for services or items rendered to active duty for authorized NATO dependents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Allowable Amount does not exceed Deductible Amount. If fiscal year allowable amounts for two or more beneficiary members of a family total less than $100.00 ($300.00 if paragraph (f) (2)(i)(B)(2) of this section applies), but more of the beneficiary members submit a claim for over $50.00 ($150.00 if paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B)(1) of this section applies), neither the family nor the individual deductible will have been met and no CHAMPUS benefits are payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For any family the outpatient deductible amounts will be applied sequentially as the CHAMPUS claims are processed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the fiscal year outpatient deductible under either paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) or (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in another geographic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the

CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable beneficiary or family fiscal year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second beneficiary or family fiscal year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (f)(B)(2)(i) of this section in the case of dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above with Persian Gulf Conflict service, dependents of service members who were killed in the Gulf, or who died subsequent to Gulf service, and of members who retired prior to October 1, 1991, after having served in the Gulf War, the deductible shall be the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section for care rendered prior to October 1, 1991, and the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section for care rendered on or after October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may waive the annual individual or family fiscal year deductible for dependents of a Reserve Component member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days or a National Guard member who is called or ordered to fulltime federal National Guard duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)). For purposes of this paragraph, a dependent is a lawful husband or wife of the member and a child is defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (2), and (4) of Sec. 199.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inpatient cost-sharing. Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for the payment of the first $25 of the allowable institutional costs incurred with each covered inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (refer to Sec. 199.6 of the part), or the amount the beneficiary or sponsor would have been charged had the inpatient care been provided in a Uniformed Service hospital, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Transportation) prescribes the fair charges for inpatient hospital care provided through Uniformed Services medical facilities.

A separate cost-sharing amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) is payable for each inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institution, regardless of the purpose of the admission (such as medical or surgical), regardless of the number of times the beneficiary is admitted, and regardless of whether or not the inpatient admissions are for the same or related conditions; except that successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the inpatient cost-share payable, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions. However, notwithstanding this provision, all admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions (refer to paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiple family inpatient admissions. A separate cost-sharing amount is payable for each inpatient admission, regardless of whether or not two or more beneficiary members of a family are admitted at the same time or from the same cause (such as an accident). A separate beneficiary inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied for each separate admission on each beneficiary member of the family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Newborn patient in his or her own right. When a newborn infant remains as an inpatient in his or her own right (usually after the mother is discharged), the newborn child becomes the beneficiary and patient and the extended inpatient stay becomes a separate inpatient admission. In such a situation, a new, separate inpatient cost-sharing amount is applied. If a multiple birth is involved (such as twins or triplets) and two or more newborn infants become patients in their own

right, a separate inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied to the inpatient stay for each newborn child who has remained as an inpatient in his or her own right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Inpatient cost-sharing for mental health services. For care provided on or after October 1, 1995, the inpatient cost-sharing for mental health services is $20 per day for each day of the inpatient admission. This $20 per day cost sharing amount applies to admissions to any hospital for mental health services, any residential treatment facility, any substance abuse rehabilitation facility, and any partial hospitalization program providing mental health or substance use disorder rehabilitation services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Outpatient cost-sharing. Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of 20 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ambulatory surgery. Notwithstanding the above provisions pertaining to outpatient cost-sharing, dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of $25 for surgical care that is authorized and received while in an outpatient status and that has been designated in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Psychiatric partial hospitalization services.

Members of the Armed Forces (and their family members) who are eligible for TAMP under paragraph 199.3(e) of this Part are subject to the same beneficiary or sponsor liability as family members of members of the uniformed services described in this paragraph (f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Former members and dependents of former members. CHAMPUS beneficiary liability set forth for former members and dependents of former members is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services or supplies. The annual fiscal year deductible for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided former members and dependents of former members is the same as the annual fiscal year outpatient deductible applicable to dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above (refer to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inpatient cost-sharing. Cost-sharing amounts for inpatient services shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Services subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. The cost-share shall be the lesser of: an amount calculated by multiplying a per diem amount by the total number of days in the hospital stay except the day of discharge; or 25 percent of the hospital's billed charges. The per diem amount shall be calculated so that, in the aggregate, the total cost-sharing amounts for these beneficiaries is equivalent to 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs for covered services or supplies provided on an inpatient basis by authorized providers. The per diem amount shall be published annually by OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Services subject to the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. The cost-share is dependent upon whether the hospital is paid a hospital-specific per diem or a regional per diem under the provisions of Sec. 199.14(a)(2). With respect to care paid for on the basis of a hospital specific per diem, the cost-share shall be 25% of the hospital-specific per diem amount. For care paid for on the basis of a regional per diem, the cost share shall be the lower of a fixed daily amount or 25% of the hospital's billed charges. The fixed daily amount shall be 25 percent of the per diem adjusted so that total beneficiary cost shares will equal 25 percent of total payments under the mental health per diem payment system. These fixed daily amount shall be updated annually and published in the Federal Register along with the per diems published pursuant to Sec. 199.14(a)(2)(iv)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other services. For services exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system and the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system and services provided by institutions other than hospitals, the cost-share shall be 25% of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Outpatient cost-sharing. Former members and dependents of former members are responsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs or charges beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Psychiatric partial hospitalization services. Institutional and professional services provided under the psychiatric partial hospitalization program authorized by paragraph (b)(10) of this section shall be cost shared as inpatient services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Former spouses. CHAMPUS beneficiary liability for former spouses eligible under the provisions set forth in Sec. 199.3 of this part is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services or supplies. An eligible former spouse is responsible for the payment of the first $150.00 of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided in any one fiscal year. (Except for services received prior to April 1, 1991, the deductible amount is $50.00). The former spouse cannot contribute to, nor benefit from, any family deductible of the member or former member to whom the former spouse was married or of any CHAMPUS-eligible children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inpatient cost-sharing. Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of cost-sharing amounts the same as those required for former members and dependents of former members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Outpatient cost-sharing. Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cost-Sharing under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program. Cost-sharing is dependent upon the type of partnership program entered into, whether external or internal. (See paragraph (p) of Sec. 199.1, for general requirements of the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> External Partnership Agreement. Authorized costs associated with the use of the civilian facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under the normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures applicable under CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Internal Partnership Agreement. Beneficiary cost-sharing under internal agreements will be the same as charges prescribed for care in military treatment facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)-(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Cost-sharing for services provided under special discount arrangements--(i) General rule. With respect to services determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) to be covered by Sec. 199.14(e), the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to establish, as an exception to the cost-sharing amount normally required pursuant to this section, a different cost-share amount that appropriately reflects the application of the statutory cost-share to the discount arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. With respect to services determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) to be covered by Sec. 199.14(e), the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to establish, as an exception to the cost-sharing amount normally required pursuant to this section, a different cost-share amount that appropriately reflects the application of the statutory cost-share to the discount arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specific applications. The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of services provided by individual health care professionals and other noninstitutional providers, the cost-share shall be the usual percentage of the CHAMPUS allowable charge determined under Sec. 199.14(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of services provided by institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under Sec. 199.14(a)(1) or per-diem amount under Sec. 199.14(a)(2)), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the cost-share amount that would apply for a beneficiary other than an active duty dependent pursuant to the normal pre-set rate would be reduced by the same percentage by which the pre-set rate was reduced in setting the discount rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Waiver of deductible amounts or cost-sharing not allowed--(i) General rule. Because deductible amounts and cost sharing are statutorily mandated, except when specifically authorized by law (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS), a provider may not waive or forgive beneficiary liability for annual deductible amounts or inpatient or outpatient cost sharing, as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Because deductible amounts and cost sharing are statutorily mandated, except when specifically authorized by law (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS), a provider may not waive or forgive beneficiary liability for annual deductible amounts or inpatient or outpatient cost sharing, as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for bad debts. This general rule is not violated in cases in which a provider has made all reasonable attempts to effect collection, without success, and determines in accordance with generally accepted fiscal management standards that the beneficiary liability in a particular case is an uncollectible bad debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Remedies for noncompliance. Potential remedies for noncompliance with this requirement include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A claim for services regarding which the provider has waived the beneficiary's liability may be disallowed in full, or, alternatively, the amount payable for such a claim may be reduced by the amount of the beneficiary liability waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Repeated noncompliance with this requirement is a basis for exclusion of a provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Catastrophic loss protection for basic program benefits. Fiscal year limits, or catastrophic caps, on the amounts beneficiaries are required to pay are established as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dependents of active duty members. The maximum family liability is $1,000 for deductibles and cost-shares based on allowable charges for Basic Program services and supplies received in a fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All other beneficiaries. For all other categories of beneficiary families (including those eligible under CHAMPVA) the fiscal year cap is $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payment after cap is met. After a family has paid the maximum cost-share and deductible amounts (dependents of active duty members $1,000 and all others $3,000), for a fiscal year, CHAMPUS will pay allowable amounts for remaining covered services through the end of that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (f)(10):</p><p class="depth0">Under the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, the cap for beneficiaries other than dependents of active duty members was reduced from $7,500 to $3,000 effective October 30, 2000. Prior to this, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 reduced this cap from $10,000 to $7,500 on October 1, 1992. The cap remains at $1,000 for dependents of active duty members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program. Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program is addressed in Sec. 199.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Elimination of cost-sharing for certain preventive services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective for dates of service on or after October 14, 2008, beneficiaries, subject to the limitation in paragraph (f)(12)(iii) of this section, shall not pay any cost-share for preventive services listed in paragraph (e)(28)(i) through (iv) of this section. The beneficiary shall not be required to pay any portion of the cost of these preventive services even if the beneficiary has not satisfied the deductible for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Beneficiaries who paid a cost-share for preventive services listed in paragraph (e)(28)(i) through (iv) of this section on or after October 14, 2008, may request reimbursement until January 28, 2013 according to procedures established by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> This elimination of cost-sharing for preventive services does not apply to any beneficiary who is a Medicare-eligible beneficiary.

Enuretic conditioning programs, but enuretic alarms may be cost-shared when determined to be medically necessary in the treatment of enuresis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(59)</em> Duplicate equipment. As defined in Sec. 199.2, duplicate equipment is excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(60)</em> Autopsy and postmortem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(61)</em> Camping. All camping even though organized for a specific therapeutic purpose (such as diabetic camp or a camp for emotionally disturbed children), and even though offered as a part of an otherwise covered treatment plan or offered through a CHAMPUS-approved facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(62)</em> Housekeeper, companion. Housekeeping, homemaker, or attendant services; sitter or companion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(63)</em> Non-covered condition/treatment, unauthorized provider. All services and supplies (including inpatient institutional costs) related to a non-covered condition or treatment, including any necessary follow-on care or the treatment of complications, are excluded from coverage except as provided under paragraph (e)(9) of this section. In addition, all services and supplies provided by an unauthorized provider are excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(64)</em> Comfort or convenience. Personal, comfort, or convenience items such as beauty and barber services, radio, television, and telephone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(65)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(66)</em> Megavitamin psychiatric therapy, orthomolecular psychiatric therapy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(67)</em> Transportation. All transportation except by ambulance, as specifically provided under paragraph (d), and except as authorized in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(68)</em> Travel. All travel even though prescribed by a physician and even if its purpose is to obtain medical care, except as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section in connection with a CHAMPUS-required physical examination and as specified in Sec. 199.17(n)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(69)</em> Institutions. Services and supplies provided by other than a hospital, unless the institution has been approved specifically by OCHAMPUS. Nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, halfway houses, homes for the aged, or institutions of similar purpose are excluded from consideration as approved facilities under the Basic Program.</p><p class="depth0">Note: In order to be approved under CHAMPUS, an institution must, in addition to meeting CHAMPUS standards, provide a level of care for which CHAMPUS benefits are payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(70)-(71)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(72)</em> Inpatient mental health services. Effective for care received on or after October 1, 1991, services in excess of 30 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission), in the case of a patient nineteen years of age or older, 45 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission) in the case of a patient under 19 years of age, or 150 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission) in the case of inpatient mental health services provided as residential treatment care, unless coverage for such services is granted by a waiver by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. In cases involving the day limitations, waivers shall be handled in accordance with paragraphs (b)(8) or (b)(9) of this section. For services prior to October 1, 1991, services in excess of 60 days in any calendar year unless additional coverage is granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(73)</em> Economic interest in connection with mental health admissions. Inpatient mental health services (including both acute care and RTC services) are excluded for care received when a patient is referred to a provider of such services by a physician (or other health care professional with authority to admit) who has an economic interest in the facility to which the patient is referred, unless a waiver is granted. Requests for waiver shall be considered under the same procedure and based on the same criteria as used for obtaining preadmission authorization (or continued stay authorization for emergency admissions), with the only additional requirement being that the economic interest be disclosed as part of the request. The same reconsideration and appeals procedures that apply to day limit waivers shall also apply to decisions regarding requested waivers of the economic interest exclusion. However, a provider may appeal a reconsidered determination that an economic relationship constitutes an economic interest within the scope of the exclusion to the same extent that a provider may appeal determination under Sec. 199.15(i)(3). This exclusion does not apply to services under the Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) in Sec. 199.5 or provided as partial hospital care. If a situation arises where a decision is made to exclude CHAMPUS payment solely on the basis of the provider's economic interest, the normal CHAMPUS appeals process will be available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(74)</em> Not specifically listed. Services and supplies not specifically listed as a benefit in this part. This exclusion is not intended to preclude extending benefits for those services or supplies specifically determined to be covered within the intent of this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, even though not otherwise listed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The fact that a physician may prescribe, order, recommend, or approve a service or supply does not, of itself, make it medically necessary or make the charge an allowable expense, even though it is not listed specifically as an exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payment and liability for certain potentially excludable services under the Peer Review Organization program--(1) Applicability. This subsection provides special rules that apply only to services retrospectively determined under the Peer Review organization (PRO)

program (operated pursuant to Sec. 199.15) to be potentially excludable (in whole or in part) from the basic program under paragraph (g) of this section. Services may be excluded by reason of being not medically necessary (paragraph (g)(1) of this section), at an inappropriate level (paragraph (g)(3) of this section), custodial care (paragraph (g)(7) of this section) or other reason relative to reasonableness, necessity or appropriateness (which services shall throughout the remainder of this subsection, be referred to as ``not medically necessary''). (Also throughout the remainder of the subsection, ``services'' includes items and ``provider'' includes supplier). This paragraph does not apply to coverage determinations made by OCHAMPUS or the fiscal intermediaries which are not based on medical necessity determinations made under the PRO program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. This subsection provides special rules that apply only to services retrospectively determined under the Peer Review organization (PRO)

program (operated pursuant to Sec. 199.15) to be potentially excludable (in whole or in part) from the basic program under paragraph (g) of this section.

This paragraph does not apply to coverage determinations made by OCHAMPUS or the fiscal intermediaries which are not based on medical necessity determinations made under the PRO program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment for certain potentially excludable expenses. Services determined under the PRO program to be potentially excludable by reason of the exclusions in paragraph (g) of this section for not medically necessary services will not be determined to be excludable if neither the beneficiary to whom the services were provided nor the provider (institutional or individual) who furnished the services knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the services were subject to those exclusions. Payment may be made for such services as if the exclusions did not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liability for certain excludable services. In any case in which items or services are determined excludable by the PRO program by reason of being not medically necessary and payment may not be made under paragraph (h)(2) of this section because the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section are not met, the beneficiary may not be held liable (and shall be entitled to a full refund from the provider of the amount excluded and any cost share amount already paid) if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The beneficiary did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the items or services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Criteria for determining that beneficiary knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable. A beneficiary who receives services excludable by reason of being not medically necessary will be found to have known that the services were excludable if the beneficiary has been given written notice that the services were excludable or that similar or comparable services provided on a previous occasion were excludable and that notice was given by the OCHAMPUS, CHAMPUS PRO or fiscal intermediary, a group or committee responsible for utilization review for the provider, or the provider who provided the services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Criteria for determining that provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable. An institutional or individual provider will be found to have known or been reasonably expected to have known that services were excludable under this subsection under any one of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The PRO or fiscal intermediary had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable or that similar or reasonably comparable services were excludable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The utilization review group or committee for an institutional provider or the beneficiary's attending physician had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provider had informed the beneficiary that the services were excludable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The provider had received written materials, including notices, manual issuances, bulletins, guides, directives or other materials, providing notification of PRO screening criteria specific to the condition of the beneficiary. Attending physicians who are members of the medical staff of an institutional provider will be found to have also received written materials provided to the institutional provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The services that are at issue are the subject of what are generally considered acceptable standards of practice by the local medical community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Preadmission authorization was available but not requested, or concurrent review requirements were not followed.
