                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance and operation. The Owner shall maintain and operate  the project so as to provide Decent, Safe, and Sanitary housing and he  shall provide all the services, maintenance and utilities which he  agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing  assistance payments or other applicable remedies if he fails to meet  these obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection prior to occupancy. Prior to occupancy of any unit by  a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit and both shall  certify, on forms prescribed by HUD, that they have inspected the unit  and have determined it to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary in accordance  with the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these  reports shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic inspections. HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) will  inspect or cause to be inspected each Contract unit and related  facilities at least annually and at such other times (including prior to  initial occupancy and rerenting of any unit) as HUD (or the PHA) may  determine to be necessary to assure that the Owner is meeting his  obligation to maintain the units in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition  and to provide the agreed upon utilities and other services. HUD (or the  PHA) will take into account complaints by occupants and any other  information coming to its attention in scheduling inspections and shall  notify the Owner and the Family of its determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Units not decent, safe, and sanitary. If HUD (or the PHA, as  appropriate) notifies the Owner that he has failed to maintain a  dwelling unit in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition and the Owner  fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the  notice, HUD (or the PHA) may exercise any of its rights or remedies  under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments,  even if the Family continues to occupy the unit. If, however, the Family  wishes to be rehoused in another dwelling unit with Section 8 assistance  and HUD (or the PHA) does not have other Section 8 funds for such  purposes, HUD (or the PHA) may use the abated housing assistance  payments for the purpose of rehousing the Family in another dwelling  unit. Where this is done, the Owner shall be notified that he will be  entitled to resumption of housing assistance payments for the vacated  dwelling unit if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unit is restored to Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Family is willing to and does move back to the restored  dwelling unit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A deduction is made for the expenses incurred by the Family for  both moves.</p>
