When the college or university does not require the student to matriculate while pursuing the additional study at the 2-year college, VA may approve an enrollment in a course offered in the program at the 2-year college only if the certifications described in either paragraph (l)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section are made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The college or university granting the baccalaureate degree certifies that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Full credit is granted for the course upon the student's transfer to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The courses taken at the 2-year college will be acceptable in partial fulfillment for the baccalaureate degree, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The student will be required to matriculate during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either the 2-year college or the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Certifies to the appropriate State approving agency that as a result of agreement between the 2-year college and the college or university offering the baccalaureate degree all of the courses pursued beyond the associate degree will be accepted without any loss of credit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree. This certification may be made

once for each program for which an agreement exists.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certifies to VA that the veteran or eligible person is enrolled in courses covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (l)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will not approve a veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in a course or subject if the veteran or eligible person:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is pursuing a degree, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not matriculated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State approving agency from including more restrictive matriculation requirements in its approval criteria.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3452)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Courses offered under contract. VA may not approve the enrollment of a veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person in a course as a part of a program of education offered by any educational institution if the educational institution or entity providing the course under contract has not obtained a separate approval for the course in the same manner as for any other course as required by Sec. 21.4253, Sec. 21.4254, Sec. 21.4256, Sec. 21.4257, Sec. 21.4260, Sec. 21.4261, Sec. 21.4263, Sec. 21.4264, Sec. 21.4265, Sec. 21.4266, or Sec. 21.4267, as appropriate.
