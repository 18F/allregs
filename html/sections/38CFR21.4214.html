Any testimony or evidence, either oral or written, which  the Committee on Educational Allowances deems to be of probative value  in deciding the question at issue will be admitted in evidence. While  irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, testimony, or  arguments should be excluded, reasonable latitude will be permitted with  respect to the relevancy, materiality, and competency of evidence. In  most instances the evidence will consist of official records of the  educational institution and VA, and these documents may be attested to  and introduced by affidavit; but the introduction of oral testimony by  the educational institution or by VA will be allowed, as appropriate, in  any instance where the educational institution or VA Counsel desires.  VA, however, will neither subpoena any witness on behalf of the  educational institution for such purposes nor bear any expenses in  connection with the appearance of such witness. In instances where the  evidence reasonably available consists of signed written statements,  secondary or hearsay evidence, etc., such evidence may be introduced  into the record and will be given the weight and consideration which the  circumstances warrant.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rule 5. The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational  Allowances will identify all exhibits in the order of introduction or  receipt (numerically for VA exhibits and alphabetically for exhibits  introduced by the educational institution). All such original exhibits  or documents shall be attached to the original of the transcript. VA  shall make photocopies or certified copies and attach them to the copy  of the transcript furnished to the educational institution and the VA  Counsel. The original transcript will accompany the Committee's  recommendation to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of  jurisdiction along with all exhibits, briefs, or written statements  received by the Committee during the course of the proceedings. Such  documents should be clearly marked to indicate which were received into  evidence and relied upon by the Committee in making its recommendations.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rule 6. The Committee on Educational Allowances, at its  discretion, may reasonably limit the number of persons appearing at the  hearing, including any affected individuals presented as witnesses by VA  or the educational institution.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rule 7. Any person who is presented to testify will be required  to be duly placed under oath or affirmation by the Chairperson of the  Committee on Educational Allowances. If an official of the educational  institution desires to present a statement personally, the individual  will be required to be placed under oath or affirmation. The Chairperson  will advise each witness that the Committee understands that he or she  is voluntarily appearing before the Committee; that any testimony or  statement given will be considered as being completely voluntary;   and that no one has authority to require the individual to make any  statement or answer any question against his or her will before the  Committee, except that a person called as a witness on behalf of either  VA or the educational institution must be willing to submit to cross- examination with respect to testimony given. Each witness will also be  advised that his or her testimony or statement, if false, even though  voluntary, may subject him or her to prosecution under Federal statutes.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Rule 8. Any member of the Committee on Educational Allowances  may question any witness presented to testify at the hearing or either a  representative of the educational institution or the VA Counsel  concerning matters that are relevant to the question at issue.  Generally, questioning by a Committee member will be limited to the  extent of clarifying information on the facts and issues involved.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Rule 9. If the educational institution fails to timely notify  the Committee of its intent to participate in a hearing or if a  representative of the educational institution is scheduled to appear for  a hearing but, without good cause, fails to appear either in person or  by writing, the Committee will proceed with the hearing and will review  the case on the basis of the evidence of record which shall be presented  by the VA Counsel.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Rule 10. Any objection by an authorized representative of the  educational institution or the VA Counsel on a ruling by the Chairperson  of the Committee on Educational Allowances regarding the admissibility  of testimony or other evidence submitted will be made a matter of  record, together with the substance in brief of the testimony intended  or other evidence concerned. If the other evidence concerned is in the  form of an affidavit or other document, it may be accepted for filing as  a future reference if it is later ruled admissible as part of the record  of the hearing.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Rule 11. Objections relating to the jurisdiction or membership  of the Committee on Educational Allowances or the constitutionality of  statutes or the constitutionality of, or statutory authority for, VA  regulations, are not before the Committee for decision. The time of the  Committee will not be used to hear arguments in this regard. However,  any such matters outside the province of the Committee may be the  subject of a brief or a letter for consideration by the VA Office of  General Counsel upon completion of the hearing. The ruling of such  authority upon such issues will be obtained and included in the record  before the Committee's recommendations are submitted to the Director of  the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction. If the VA General  Counsel's ruling on such legal issues necessitates reopening the  proceeding, that shall be done before the Committee makes its  recommendations to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of  jurisdiction.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Rule 12. The hearing will be open to the public.

The hearing will be conducted in an orderly manner with  dignity and decorum. The conduct of members of the Committee on  Educational Allowances, the VA Counsel, and any representatives of the  educational institution shall be characterized by appropriate  impartiality, fairness, and cooperation. The Chairperson of the  Committee shall take such action as may be necessary, including  suspension of the hearing or the removal of the offending person from  the hearing room for misbehavior, disorderly conduct, or the persistent  disregard of the Chairperson's ruling. Where this occurs, the  Chairperson will   point out that the Committee is entitled to every possible consideration  in order that the case may be presented clearly and fully, which may be  accomplished only through observance of orderly procedures.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Rule 14. The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational  Allowances will conduct the hearing proceedings in such a manner that  will protect from disclosure information which tends to disclose or  compromise investigative sources or methods or which would violate the  privacy of any individual. The salient facts, which form the basis of  charges, may be disclosed and discussed without revealing the source.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Rule 15. At the close of the hearing, the Chairperson of the  Committee on Educational Allowances shall inform the appropriate  representative of the educational institution that the arguments and the  evidence presented will be given careful consideration; and that notice  of the decision of the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of  jurisdiction, together with the Committee's recommendations, will be  furnished to the educational institution and the VA Counsel at the  earliest possible time. The Chairperson will also indicate that notice  of the Director's decision will be published in the Federal Register for  the information of all other interested persons.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a),  3689(d), 3690)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Rule 16. In making its findings of facts and recommendations,  the Committee on Educational Allowances will consider only questions  which are referred to it by the Director of the VA Regional Processing  Office of jurisdiction as being at issue and which are within the  jurisdiction of the Committee.
