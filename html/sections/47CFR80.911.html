operated with a primary supply voltage of 13.6 volts DC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an individual demonstration of the capability of the transmitter is necessary the output power requirements prescribed in this paragraph must be met as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurements of primary supply voltage and transmitter output power must be made with the equipment drawing energy only from ship's battery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary supply voltage, measured at the power input terminals to the transmitter, and the output power of the transmitter, terminated in a matching artificial load, must be measured at the end of 10 minutes of continuous operation of the transmitter at its full power output.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The primary supply voltage must not be less than 11.5 volts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transmitter output power must be not less than 15 watts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For primary supply voltages, measured in accordance with the procedures of this paragraph, greater than 11.5 volts, but less than 12.6 volts, the required transmitter output power shall be equal to or greater than the value calculated from the formula

P = 4.375(V)-35.313

where V equals the measured primary voltage and P is the calculated output power in watts.''
