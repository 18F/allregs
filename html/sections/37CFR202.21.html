                                Sec.  202.21  Deposit of identifying material instead of copies.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Subject to the specific provisions of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, and to Sec. Sec.  202.19(e)(1)(iv) and 202.20(d)(1)(iv), in any case where the deposit of identifying material is permitted or required under Sec.  202.19 or Sec.  202.20 of these regulations for published or unpublished works, the material shall consist of photographic prints, transparencies, photostats, drawings, or similar two-dimensional

reproductions or renderings of the work, in a form visually perceivable without the aid of a machine or device. In the case of pictorial or graphic works, such material should reproduce the actual colors employed in the work. In all other cases, such material may be in black and white or may consist of a reproduction of the actual colors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Completeness; number of sets. As many pieces of identifying material as are necessary to show the entire copyrightable content in the ordinary case, but in no case less than an adequate representation of such content, of the work for which deposit is being made, or for which registration is being sought shall be submitted. Except in cases falling under the provisions of Sec.  202.19(d)(2)(iii) or Sec.  202.20(c)(2)(iii) with respect to holograms, only one set of such complete identifying material is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Size. Photographic transparencies must be at least 35mm in size and, if such transparencies are 3 x 3 inches or less, must be fixed in cardboard, plastic, or similar mounts to facilitate identification, handling, and storage. The Copyright Office prefers that transparencies larger than 3 x 3 inches be mounted in a way that facilitates their handling and preservation, and reserves the right to require such mounting in particular cases. All types of identifying material other than photographic transparencies must be not less than 3 x 3 inches and not more than 9 x 12 inches, but preferably 8 x 10 inches. Except in the case of transparencies, the image of the work must be either lifesize or larger, or if less than lifesize must be large enough to show clearly the entire copyrightable content of the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Title and dimensions. At least one piece of identifying material must, on its front, back, or mount, indicate the title of the work; and the indication of an exact measurement of one or more dimensions of the work is preferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Copyright notice. In the case of works published with notice of copyright, the notice and its position on the work must be clearly shown on at least one piece of identifying material. Where necessary because of the size or position of the notice, a separate drawing or similar reproduction shall be submitted. Such reproduction shall be no smaller than 3 x 3 inches and no larger than 9 x 12 inches, and shall show the exact appearance and content of the notice, and its specific position on the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For separate registration of an unpublished work that is fixed, or a published work that is published, only as embodied in a soundtrack that is an integral part of a motion picture, identifying material deposited in lieu of an actual copy of the motion picture shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transcription of the entire work, or a reproduction of the entire work on a phonorecord; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Photographs or other reproductions from the motion picture showing the title of the motion picture, the soundtrack credits, and the copyright notice for the soundtrack, if any.
The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section do not apply to identifying material deposited under this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> In the case of unpublished motion pictures (including transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the public, but have not been published), identifying material deposited in lieu of an actual copy shall consist of either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of unpublished motion pictures (including transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the public, but have not been published), identifying material deposited in lieu of an actual copy shall consist of either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An audio cassette or other phonorecord reproducing the entire soundtrack or other sound portion of the motion picture, and description of the motion picture; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A set consisting of one frame enlargement or similar visual reproduction from each 10-minute segment of the motion picture, and a description of the motion picture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In either case the ``description'' may be a continuity, a pressbook, or a synopsis but in all cases it must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The title or continuing title of the work, and the episode title, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature and general content of the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date when the work was first fixed and whether or not fixation was simultaneous with first transmission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The date of first transmission, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The running time; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The credits appearing on the work, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section do not apply to identifying material submitted under this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In the case where the deposit copy or copies of a motion picture cannot be viewed for examining purposes on equipment in the Registration Program of the Copyright Office, the ``description'' required by Sec.  202.20(c)(2)(ii) of these regulations may be a continuity, a press-book, a synopsis, or a final shooting script but in all cases must be sufficient to indicate the copyrightable material in the work and include</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The continuing title of the work and the episode title, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature and general content of the program and of its dialogue or narration, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The running time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All credits appearing on the work including the copyright notice, if any.
The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section do not apply to identifying material submitted under this paragraph (h).
