                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State or Indian tribe shall comply with the Federal standards under paragraph (b) of this section when establishing, maintaining or enforcing specific NRHM routing designations

over which NRHM may or may not be transported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enhancement of public safety. The State or Indian tribe shall make a finding, supported by the record to be developed in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section, that any NRHM routing designation enhances public safety in the areas subject to its jurisdiction and in other areas which are directly affected by such highway routing designation. In making such a finding, the State or Indian tribe shall consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous Materials,'' DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89-02, July 1989 \1\ or its most current version; or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ This document may be obtained from Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Office of Enforcement and Compliance (MC-EC), 1200 New Jersey Ave., SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public participation. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall undertake the following actions to ensure participation by the public in the routing process:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day period in which to comment. At any time during this period or following review of the comments received, the State or Indian tribe shall decide whether to hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public shall be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, shall be given by publication in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete description of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for both the comment period and any public hearing may also be published in the official register of the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public hearing on the record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to present its views and any information or data related to the proposed NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, upon payment of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented during the hearing or submitted for the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice to, and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States and Indian tribes, and any other affected parties. Such actions shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in writing, of the proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway routing in all other affected States or Indian tribes. A copy of this notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This notice shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no response is received within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the proposed routing designation, the routing designation shall be considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern or disagreement expressed by any consulted official related to the proposed routing designation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this section and of any consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their representatives. Such record shall describe any concern or disagreement expressed by the officials

and any action undertaken to resolve such disagreement or address any concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through highway routing for the transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through highway routing'' as used in this paragraph means that the routing designation must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or unnecessarily delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian tribe shall utilize the procedures established in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the State or Indian tribe shall make a finding, supported by a risk analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the routing designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed routing designation, then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a State or Indian tribe shall only go into effect if it does not force a deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 percent of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction as compared to the intended deviation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the current route has the same or less risk to the public than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing designation, then the routing designation shall not be allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation which affects another State or Indian tribe shall be established, maintained, or enforced only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 397.75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Timeliness. The establishment of an NRHM routing designation by any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within 18 months of the notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities. In establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated routes, the State or Indian tribe shall use the shortest practicable route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor vehicles transporting NRHM to reach:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Terminals,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be responsible for ensuring that all of their political subdivisions comply with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for resolving all disputes between such political subdivisions within their jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof, or an Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing designation, the Governor, or Indian tribe, shall designate a routing agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency shall ensure that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction comply with the Federal standards in this section. The State or Indian tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting requirements contained in Sec. 397.73.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Population density. The population potentially exposed to an NRHM release shall be estimated from the density of the residents, employees, motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census tract maps

or other reasonable means for determining the population within a potential impact zone along a designated highway route. The impact zone is the potential range of effects in the event of a release. Special populations such as schools, hospitals, prisons, and senior citizen homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining the potential risk to the populations along a highway routing. Consideration shall be given to the amount of time during which an area will experience a heavy population density.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM highway routing designation shall be compared. Vehicle weight and size limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of lanes, degree of access control, and median and shoulder structures are examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe shall consider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported along highway routes which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and consideration shall be given to the relative impact zone and risks of each type and quantity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety agencies, consideration shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be needed as a result of an NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity of the emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and suppress NRHM releases within the impact zones.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration shall be given to the comments and concerns of all affected persons and entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall define the exposure and risk factors associated with any NRHM routing designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. Sensitive areas include, but are not limited to, homes and commercial buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands, and wildlife reserves.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect the potential severity of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control and clean up of NRHM if released shall be considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across common borders. Deviations from the most direct route shall be minimized.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Alternative routes. Consideration shall be given to the alternative routes to, or resulting from, any NRHM route designation. Alternative routes shall be examined, reviewed, or evaluated to the extent necessary to demonstrate that the most probable alternative routing resulting from a routing designation is safer than the current routing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Effects on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation made in accordance with this subpart shall not create an unreasonable burden upon interstate or intrastate commerce.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Delays in transportation. No NRHM routing designations may create unnecessary delays in the transportation of NRHM.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Climatic conditions. Weather conditions unique to a highway route such as snow, wind, ice, fog, or other climatic conditions that could affect the safety of a route, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release, or increase the difficulty of controlling it and cleaning it up shall be given appropriate consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Congestion and accident history. Traffic conditions unique to a highway routing such as: traffic congestion; accident experience with motor vehicles, traffic considerations that could affect the potential for an accident, exposure of the public to any release, ability to perform emergency response operations, or the temporary closing of a highway for cleaning up any release

shall be given appropriate consideration.
