Every claim filed against the United  States under the FTCA must be presented in writing within 2 years after  the claim accrues. 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Federal law determines the date of  accrual.

In computing the statutory time period, the day of the incident  is excluded and the day the claim was presented included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendments. Upon timely filing of an amendment to a pending  claim, the DON shall have 6 months to make a final disposition of the  claim as amended, and the claimant's option to file suit under 28 U.S.C.  2675(a) shall not accrue until 6 months after the presentment of an  amendment. 28 CFR 14.2(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suits. A civil action is barred unless suit is filed against the  United States not later than 6 months after the date of mailing of  notice of final denial of the claim. 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). The failure of  the DON to make final disposition of a claim within 6 months after it is  presented shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be  deemed a final denial of the claim. 28 U.S.C. 2675(a).
