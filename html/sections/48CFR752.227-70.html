                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 727.303, insert the following clause  in all solicitations and contracts that contain the clause at (48 CFR)  FAR 52.227-11.</p><p class="depth0">Patent Reporting Procedures (AUG 1999)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reporting inventions. In accordance with 37 CFR part 401, each  USAID-funded research recipient must disclose each subject invention to  USAID as required in (48 CFR) FAR 52.227-11(c). Such reports must be  made via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) EDISON Patent Reporting  and Tracking system. NIH created EDISON to help assist research  recipients to comply with the Bayh-Dole Act and report in a timely  manner all patentable inventions arising out of Federally-sponsored  research programs. The EDISON system uses Web technology to allow  research recipients to report and monitor their invention reports, with  the assurance that proprietary data is securely stored. The Web site for  EDISON (http://www.iedison.gov) provides users with an invention  reporting test site, as well as applicable instructions for complying  with Government regulations, and increases the potential for successful  commercialization of the inventions by helping to ensure that all  reporting requirements are met and that ownership rights are clearly  established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports on utilization of subject inventions as required under  (48 CFR) FAR 52.227-11(f) must be provided to the USAID contracting  officer's technical representative annually, and the last report under  an agreement must be provided within 90 days of the expiration of the  agreement.
