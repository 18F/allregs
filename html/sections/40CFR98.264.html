You may conduct the representative bulk sampling using a method published by a consensus standards organization, or you may use industry consensus standard practice methods, including but not limited to the Phosphate Mining States Methods Used and Adopted by the Association of Fertilizer and Phosphate Chemists (AFPC). If phosphate rock is obtained from more than one origin in a month, you must obtain a

sample from each origin of rock or obtain a composite representative sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must determine the carbon dioxide or inorganic carbon content of each monthly grab sample of phosphate rock (consumed in the production of phosphoric acid).
