An activity is not  organization-wide if it is limited to one activity, one component of the  grantee, one subject, one phase of operations, or other single  responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General management costs include the costs of performing a  service function, such as accounting, payroll preparation, or personnel  management, that is normally at the grantee's level even if the function  is physically located elsewhere for convenience or better management.  The term also includes certain occupancy and space maintenance costs as  determined under Sec. 76.568.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term does not include expenditures for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Divisional administration that is limited to one component of  the grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The governing body of the grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compensation of the chief executive officer of the grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compensation of the chief executive officer of any component of  the grantee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Operation of the immediate offices of these officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chief executive officer of the grantee is the individual who  is the head of the executive office of the grantee and exercises overall  responsibility for the operation and management of the organization. The  chief executive officer's immediate office includes any deputy chief  executive officer or similar officer along with immediate support staff  of these individuals. The term does not include the governing body of  the grantee, such as a board or a similar elected or appointed governing  body; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Components of the grantee are those organizational units  supervised directly or indirectly by the chief executive officer.
