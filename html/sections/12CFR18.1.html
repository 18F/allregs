                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this part is to require all national  banks and federal branches and agencies to prepare an annual financial  disclosure statement, and to make this statement available to security  holders, depositors, and anyone who requests it. The bank may, at its  option, supplement this financial disclosure statement with narrative  information management deems important. The availability of this  information is expected to promote better public understanding of, and  confidence in, individual national banks and the national banking  system. The annual disclosure statement will serve to complement the  supervisory efforts of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC) to promote bank safety and soundness and public confidence in the  national banking system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OMB control number. The collection of information requirements  contained in this part were approved by the Office of Management and  Budget under OMB control number 1557-0182.  [53 FR 3866, Feb. 10, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 57332, Nov. 15, 1995]</p>
