                                Sec. 3550.160  Refinancing with private credit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Objective. RHS direct loan programs are not intended to supplant  or compete with private credit sources. Therefore, borrowers are  required to refinance RHS loans with private credit sources when RHS  determines that the borrower meets RHS criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for refinancing with private credit. Borrowers must  refinance with private credit when RHS determines that the borrower has  the ability to obtain other credit at reasonable rates and terms based  on their income, assets, and credit history. Reasonable rates and terms  are those commercial rates and terms that borrowers are expected to meet  when borrowing for similar purposes. Differences in interest rates and  terms between RHS and other lenders will not be an acceptable reason for  a borrower to fail to refinance with private credit if the available  rates and terms are within the borrower's ability to pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of requirement to refinance with private credit. The  financial status of all borrowers may be reviewed periodically to  determine their ability to refinance with private credit. A borrower's  financial status may be reviewed at any time if information becomes  available to RHS that indicates that the borrower's circumstances have  changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A borrower undergoing review is required to supply, within 30  days of a request from RHS, sufficient financial information to enable  RHS to determine the borrowers ability to refinance with private credit.  Foreclosure action may be initiated against any borrower who fails to  respond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When RHS determines that a borrower has the ability to refinance  with private credit, the borrower will be required to refinance within  90 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 30 days after being notified of the requirement to  refinance with private credit, a borrower may contest the RHS decision  and provide additional financial information to document an inability to  refinance with private credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to refinance with private credit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the borrower is  unable to secure private credit, the borrower must submit written  statements and documentation to RHS showing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lenders contacted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the loan requested by the borrower and the  amount, if any, offered by the lenders.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The rates and terms offered by the lenders or the specific  reasons why other credit is not available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The information provided by the borrower to the lenders  regarding the purpose of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If RHS determines that the borrower's submission does not  demonstrate the borrower's inability to refinance with private credit,  or if the borrower fails to submit the required information, foreclosure  may be initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subordination of recapture amount. RHS may subordinate its  interest in any deferred recapture amount to permit a borrower to  refinance with private credit. The amount to which the   RHS debt will be subordinated may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount required to repay the RHS debt, exclusive of  recapture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable closing costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Up to one percent of the loan amount for loan servicing costs,  if required by the lender; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cost of any necessary repairs or improvements to the  security property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application for additional credit. A borrower who has been asked  to refinance with private credit will not be considered for additional  credit until the refinancing issue is resolved unless such additional  credit is necessary to protect the Government's interest.</p>
