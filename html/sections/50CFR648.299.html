                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within-season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Tilefish FMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specific management measures. The following specific management measures may be adjusted at any time through the framework adjustment process:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minimum fish size;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum hook size;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Closed seasons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Closed areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Gear restrictions or prohibitions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Permitting restrictions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Gear limits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Trip limits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Adjustments within existing ABC control rule levels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Introduction of new AMs, including sub ACTs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Annual specification quota setting process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Tilefish FMP Monitoring Committee composition and process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Description and identification of EFH;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> Fishing gear management measures that impact EFH;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> Habitat areas of particular concern;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvii)</em> Set-aside quotas for scientific research;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xviii)</em> Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xix)</em> Recreational management measures, including the bag limit, minimum fish size limit, seasons, and gear restrictions or prohibitions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xx)</em> IFQ program review components, including capacity reduction, safety at sea issues, transferability rules, ownership concentration caps, permit and reporting requirements, and fee and cost-recovery issues.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xxi)</em> Measures that require significant departures from previously contemplated measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may require a formal amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment process. If the MAFMC determines that an adjustment to management measures is necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP, it will recommend, develop, and analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC meetings. The MAFMC will provide the public with advance notice of the availability of the recommendation, appropriate justifications and economic and biological analyses, and opportunity to comment on the proposed adjustments prior to and at the second MAFMC meeting on that framework action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the MAFMC will make a recommendation to the Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a final rule, it must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the MAFMC's recommended management measures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Regional Administrator action. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures and, after reviewing the MAFMC's recommendation and supporting information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the Regional Administrator does not concur with the MAFMC's recommendation, the MAFMC will be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority of the Secretary to take

emergency action under section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
