                            <p class="depth0">The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) at 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1)  requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to  consult with appropriate agencies before authorizing the entry of H-2B  workers. DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv) provide that an  employer's petition to employ nonimmigrant workers on H-2B visas for  temporary non-agricultural employment in the United States (U.S.),  except for Guam, must be accompanied by an approved temporary labor  certification from the Secretary of Labor (Secretary).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The temporary labor certification reflects a  determination by the Secretary that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and who  will be available to perform the temporary services or labor for which  an employer desires to hire foreign workers, and that</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employment of the H-2B worker(s) will not adversely affect  the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. It also establishes obligations with respect to  the terms and conditions of the temporary labor certification with which  H-2B employers must comply, as well as their obligations to H-2B workers  and workers in corresponding employment. Additionally, this subpart sets  forth integrity measures for ensuring employers' continued compliance  with the terms and conditions of the temporary labor certification.
