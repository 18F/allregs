                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to service accumulation used to determine deterioration factors and service accumulation used to condition test engines. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply only for service accumulation used to condition test engines. Paragraph (e) of this section applies only for service accumulation used to determine deterioration factors. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply for all service accumulation required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Each test engine in the test fleet must be operated with all emission control systems operating properly for a period sufficient to stabilize emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each test engine in the test fleet must be operated with all emission control systems operating properly for a period sufficient to stabilize emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A manufacturer may elect to consider as stabilized emission levels from engines with no more than 125 hours of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No maintenance, other than recommended lubrication and filter changes, may be performed during service accumulation without the Administrator's approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service accumulation should be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to ensure that emissions are representative of in-use engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator if requested, records stating the rationale for selecting the service accumulation period and records describing the method used to accumulate service hours on the test engine(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This paragraph (e) describes service accumulation and alternative requirements for the purpose of developing deterioration factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service accumulation on engines, subsystems, or components selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 89.117(d). The manufacturer shall describe the form and extent of this service accumulation in the application for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of exhaust emission deterioration factors. The manufacturer shall determine the deterioration factors in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part based on service accumulation and related testing, according to the manufacturer's procedures, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternatives to service accumulation and testing for the determination of a deterioration factor. A written explanation of the appropriateness of using an alternative must be included in the application for certification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Carryover and carryacross of durability emission data. In lieu of testing an emission data or durability data engine selected under Sec. 89.117(d), a manufacturer may, with Administrator approval, use exhaust emission deterioration data on a similar engine for which certification to the same standard has previously been obtained or for which all applicable data required under Sec. 89.124 has previously been submitted. This data must be submitted in the application for certification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of on-highway deterioration data. In the case where a manufacturer produces a certified on-highway engine that is similar to the nonroad engine

to be certified, deterioration data from the on-highway engine may be applied to the nonroad engine. This application of deterioration data from an on-highway engine to a nonroad engine is subject to Administrator approval, and the determination of whether the engines are similar must be based on good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engineering analysis for established technologies. (A) In the case where an engine family uses established technology, an analysis based on good engineering practices may be used in lieu of testing to determine a deterioration factor for that engine family, subject to Administrator approval.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case where an engine family uses established technology, an analysis based on good engineering practices may be used in lieu of testing to determine a deterioration factor for that engine family, subject to Administrator approval.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Engines for which the certification levels are not at or below the Tier 3 NMHC+NOX standards described in Sec. 89.112 are considered established technology, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Manufacturers may petition the Administrator to consider an engine with a certification level below the Tier 3 +NOX standards as established technology. This petition must be based on proof that the technology used is not significantly different than that used on engines that have certification levels that are not below the Tier 3 NMHC+NOX levels.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Engines using exhaust gas recirculation or aftertreatment are excluded from the provision set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(A) through (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer shall provide a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations, and other documents, on which the deterioration factor is based, are available to the Administrator upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Interim provision for engines rated under 37 kW. For model year 1999 and 2000 engines rated under 37 kW, manufacturers may determine deterioration factors based on good engineering judgement and reasonably available information. The manufacturer must maintain and provide to the Administrator, if requested, all information used to determine deterioration factors for these engines.
