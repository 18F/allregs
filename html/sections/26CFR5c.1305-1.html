                                Sec. 5c.1305-1  Special income averaging rules for taxpayers otherwise
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If an eligible individual (as defined in section 1303 and the regulations thereunder) is described in the first sentence of Sec. 5c.1256-3(a), chooses the benefits of income averaging and otherwise complies with the special rules under section 1304 and the regulations thereunder, and has averagable income (as defined in section 1302 and the regulations thereunder) in excess of $3,000, then the individual shall compute the tax under section 1301 as provided in this section. The computation under this section shall be in lieu of the computation under Sec. 5c.1256-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of tax. The individual shall compute the tax under section 1301 as follows:
Step (1). Compute tax under section 1301 and the regulations thereunder on all taxable income, including gains or losses on regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder, using rates applicable to the taxpayer for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981.Step (2). Compute tax under section 1301 and the regulations thereunder on all taxable income, including gains or losses on regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder, using rates applicable to the taxpayer for taxable years beginning in 1982.

Step (3). Compute the percentage of adjusted gross income attributable to all sources except regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder.Step (4). Compute the percentage of adjusted gross income attributable to regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder. Both the percentage in Step (3) and the percentage in Step (4) are to be rounded to the nearest percent. The sum of both percentages must equal 100 percent.Step (5). Multiply the result of Step (1) with the result of Step (3).Step (6). Multiply the result of Step (2) with the result of Step (4).Step (7). Add the result of Step (5) and the result of Step (6). This is the tax for the individual under section 1301 for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Option to defer tax. If an individual computes the tax under section 1301 as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the individual may also opt to pay part or all of the deferrable tax under income averaging (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, in 2 or more, but not more than 5, equal installments in accordance with this section. Such individual may not opt to pay part or all of the deferrable tax in installments under Sec. 5c.1256-3. An individual opting to defer payment must attach a statement to Form 6781 indicating the computation of deferrable tax under income averaging, the number of installments in which the individual opts to pay the deferrable tax under income averaging, and the amount of each such payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deferrable tax under income averaging. The deferrable tax under income averaging is the excess of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tax for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, over</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tax for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, except that pre-transitional year gain or loss (as described in Sec. 5c.1256-2(g)) is omitted for purposes of recomputing the percentage in Step (4). As computed under this subparagraph (2), the sum of the percentage in Step (3) and Step (4) will not equal 100 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rules of application. The provisions of Sec. 5c.1256-3 (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) shall apply in computing the tax and in determining the deferrable tax under income averaging under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). Individual A is a single, calendar year taxpayer with no dependents. A reported the following amounts for the following years on line 34 of Form 1040:</p><p class="depth2">1977--$80,000</p><p class="depth2">1978--$90,000</p><p class="depth2">1979--$100,000</p><p class="depth2">1980--$110,000
A reports the following amounts for the following lines on Form 1040 for 1981:</p><p class="depth2">line 7--$120,000</p><p class="depth2">line 12--$600,000</p><p class="depth2">line 32b--$19,000</p><p class="depth2">line 33--$1,000</p><p class="depth2">The amount on line 12 is computed as follows: $937,500 of gain is attributable to regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a). Of that total, 40 percent is short term capital gain ($375,000) and 60 percent is long term capital gain ($562,500). Of the long term capital gain, 40 percent is taxable ($225,000). Therefore, A reports $600,000 on line 12 ($375,000+$225,000).</p><p class="depth2">The result of Step (1) is $464,013.41. The result of Step (2) is $337,051.52. The result of Step (3) is 17 percent. The result of Step (4) is 83 percent. The result of Step (5) is $78,882.28. The result of Step (6) is $279,752.76. The result of Step (7) is $358,635.04. This is A's tax for 1981 under section 1301.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that $703,125 of the $937,500 gain attributable to regulated futures contracts is pre-transitional year gain or loss (as described in Sec. 5c.1256-2(g)). A's tax for 1981 under section 1301 is $358,635.04. A may opt to pay in installments a maximum of $221,004.68 of the tax due in 1981. If A opts to defer the maximum amount and pay in 5 equal installments, A must pay for 1981 a tax of $181,831.30. Each of the 4 succeeding installments is $44,200.94 plus interest computed in accordance with Sec. 5c.1256-3(g)(3).
