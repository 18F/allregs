Stations have the discretion as to the  form of these notifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stations that lack the technical ability to locally-originate  programming, or find that airing of viewer notifications would pose some  sort of a hardship, may notify their viewers by some other reasonable  means, e.g. publication of a notification in a local newspaper. Stations  have discretion as to the format and time-frame of such local  notification.  [76 FR 44829, July 27, 2011]</p>
