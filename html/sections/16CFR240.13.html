                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and 2(f) of the  Act may be enforced by disfavored customers, among others.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A customer should not induce or receive advertising  allowances for special promotion of the seller's product in connection  with the customer's anniversary sale or new store opening when the  customer knows or should know that such allowances, or suitable  alternatives, are not available on proportionally equal terms to all  other customers competing with it in the distribution of the seller's  product.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: Frequently the employees of sellers or third parties,  such as brokers, perform in-store services for their grocery retailer  customers, such as stocking of shelves, building of displays and  checking or rotating inventory, etc. A customer operating a retail  grocery business should not induce or receive such services when the  customer knows or should know that such services (or usable and suitable  alternative services) are not available on proportionally equal terms to  all other customers competing with it in the distribution of the  seller's product.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: Where a customer has entered into a contract,  understanding, or arrangement for the purchase of advertising with a  newspaper or other advertising medium, such as the Internet, that  provides for a deferred rebate or other reduction in the price of the  advertising, the customer should advise any seller from whom  reimbursement for the advertising is claimed that the claimed rate of  reimbursement is subject to a deferred rebate or other reduction in  price. In the event that any rebate or adjustment in the price is  received, the customer should refund to the seller the amount of any  excess payment or allowance.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4: A customer should not induce or receive an allowance in  excess of that offered in the seller's advertising plan by billing the  seller at ``vendor rates'' or for any other amount in excess of that  authorized in the seller's promotional program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Third party liability. Third parties, such as advertising media,  may violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act through double  or fictitious rates or billing. An advertising medium, such as the  Internet, a newspaper, broadcast station, or printer of catalogues, that  publishes a rate schedule containing fictitious rates (or rates that are  not reasonably expected to be applicable to a representative number of  advertisers), may violate section 5 if the customer uses such deceptive  schedule or invoice for a claim for an advertising allowance, payment or  credit greater than that to which it would be entitled under the  seller's promotional offering. Similarly, an advertising medium that  furnishes a customer with an invoice that does not reflect the  customer's actual net advertising cost may violate section 5 if the  customer uses the invoice to obtain larger payments than it is entitled  to receive.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A newspaper has a ``national'' rate and a lower ``local''  rate. A retailer places an advertisement with the newspaper at the local  rate for a seller's product for which the retailer will seek  reimbursement under the seller's cooperative advertising plan. The  newspaper should not send the retailer two bills, one at the national  rate and another at the local rate actually charged.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A newspaper has several published rates. A large retailer  has in the past earned the lowest rate available. The newspaper should  not submit invoices to the retailer showing a high rate by agreement  between them unless the invoice discloses that the retailer may receive  a rebate and states the amount (or approximate amount) of the rebate, if  known, and if not known, the amount of rebate the retailer could  reasonably anticipate.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: A radio station has a flat rate for spot announcements,  subject to volume discounts. A retailer buys enough spots to qualify for  the discounts. The station should not submit an invoice to the retailer  that does not show either the actual net cost or the discount rate.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4: An advertising agent buys a large volume of newspaper  advertising space at a low, unpublished negotiated rate. Retailers then  buy the space from the agent at a rate lower than they could buy this  space directly from the newspaper. The agent should not furnish the  retailers invoices showing a rate higher than the retailers actually  paid for the space.</p>
