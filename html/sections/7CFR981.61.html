                            <p class="depth0">The Board, on the basis of reports by handlers, shall redetermine the kernel weight of almonds received by each handler for his own account during each crop year through each of the following dates: December 31, March 31, and June 30. Such redetermined kernel weight for each handler shall be the basis for computing his reserve obligation for the crop year through such dates, except that adjustment shall be made for almonds on which the obligation has been assumed by another handler. The redetermined kernel weight of each handler's receipts, as of any date during the crop year, shall be his carryover as of that date plus the weight of almonds delivered or used in products minus the carryover at the beginning of the crop year, the weight on which another handler has assumed the obligations, and the weight delivered to exempt outlets. Weights used in such computations for various classifications of almonds shall be:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For unshelled almonds, the kernelweight based on representative samples reduced to shelled weight;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For shelled almonds, the net weight; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For shelled almonds used in production of almond products, the net weight of such almonds.
