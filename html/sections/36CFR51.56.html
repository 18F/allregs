                            <p class="depth0">After receiving the detailed construction report (and certification,  if requested), from the concessioner, the Director will review the  report, certification and other information as appropriate to determine  that the reported construction cost is consistent with the construction  cost approved by the Director in advance of the construction and that  all costs included in the construction cost are eligible direct or  indirect costs as defined in this part. The construction cost determined  by the Director will be the final determination of construction cost for  purposes of the leasehold surrender interest value in the related  capital improvement unless the concessioner requests arbitration of the  construction cost under Sec. 51.57. The Director may at any time review  a construction cost determination (subject to arbitration under Sec.  51.57) if the Director has reason to believe that it was based on false,  misleading or incomplete information.
