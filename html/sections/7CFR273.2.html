                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Operation of food stamp offices and processing of applications-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Office operations. State agencies must establish procedures  governing the operation of food stamp offices that the State agency  determines best serve households in the State, including households with  special needs, such as, but not limited to, households with elderly or  disabled members, households in rural areas with low-income members,  homeless individuals, households residing on reservations, households  with adult members who are not proficient in English, and households  with earned income (working households). The State agency must provide  timely, accurate, and fair service to applicants for, and participants  in, the Food Stamp Program. The State agency cannot, as a condition of  eligibility, impose additional application or application processing  requirements. The State agency must have a procedure for informing  persons who wish to apply for food stamps about the application process  and their rights and responsibilities. The State agency must base food  stamp eligibility solely on the criteria contained in the Act and this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application processing. The application process includes filing  and completing an application form, being interviewed, and having  certain information verified. The State agency must act promptly on all  applications and provide food stamp benefits retroactive to the month of  application to those households that have completed the application  process and have been determined eligible. The State agency must make  expedited service available to households in immediate need. Specific  responsibilities of households and State agencies in the application  process are detailed below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Food Stamp application form--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Content. Each application form  shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In prominent and boldface lettering and understandable terms a  statement that the information provided by the applicant in connection  with the application for food stamp   benefits will be subject to verification by Federal, State and local  officials to determine if such information is factual; that if any  information is incorrect, food stamps may be denied to the applicant;  and that the applicant may be subject to criminal prosecution for  knowingly providing incorrect information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In prominent and boldface lettering and understandable terms a  description of the civil and criminal provisions and penalties for  violations of the Food Stamp Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement to be signed by one adult household member which  certifies, under penalty of perjury, the truth of the information  contained in the application, including the information concerning  citizenship and alien status of the members applying for benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A place on the front page of the application where the  applicant can write his/her name, address, and signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In plain and prominent language on or near the front page of the  application, notification of the household's right to immediately file  the application as long as it contains the applicant's name and address  and the signature of a responsible household member or the household's  authorized representative. Regardless of the type of system the State  agency uses (paper or electronic), it must provide a means for  households to immediately begin the application process with name,  address and signature;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In plain and prominent language on or near the front page of  the application, a description of the expedited service provisions  described in paragraph (i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> In plain and prominent language on or near the front page of  the application, notification that benefits are provided from the date  of application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The following nondiscrimination statement on the application  itself even if the State agency uses a joint application form:</p><p class="depth0">``In accordance with Federal law and U.S. Department of Agriculture  policy, this institution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis  of race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, political beliefs,  or disability.</p><p class="depth0">``To file a complaint of discrimination, write USDA, Director,  Office of Civil Rights, Room 326-W, Whitten Building, 1400 Independence  Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20250-9410 or call (202) 720-5964 (voice  and TDD). USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer.''; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> For multi-program applications, contain language which clearly  affords applicants the option of answering only those questions relevant  to the program or programs for which they are applying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income and eligibility verification system (IEVS). If the State  agency chooses to use IEVS in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this  section, it must notify all applicants for food stamp benefits at the  time of application and at each recertification through a written  statement on or provided with the application form that information  available through IEVS will be requested, used and may be verified  through collateral contact when discrepancies are found by the State  agency, and that such information may affect the household's eligibility  and level of benefits. The regulations at Sec. 273.2(f)(4)(ii) govern  the use of collateral contacts. The State agency must also notify all  applicants on the application form that the alien status of applicant  household members may be subject to verification by INS through the  submission of information from the application to INS, and that the  submitted information received from INS may affect the household's  eligibility and level of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Jointly processed cases. If a State agency has a procedure that  allows applicants to apply for the food stamp program and another  program at the same time, the State agency shall notify applicants that  they may file a joint application for more than one program or they may  file a separate application for food stamps independent of their  application for benefits from any other program. All food stamp  applications, regardless of whether they are joint applications or  separate applications, must be processed for food stamp purposes in  accordance with food stamp procedural, timeliness, notice, and fair  hearing requirements. No household shall have its food stamp benefits  denied solely on   the basis that its application to participate in another program has  been denied or its benefits under another program have been terminated  without a separate determination by the State agency that the household  failed to satisfy a food stamp eligibility requirement. Households that  file a joint application for food stamps and another program and are  denied benefits for the other program shall not be required to resubmit  the joint application or to file another application for food stamps but  shall have its food stamp eligibility determined based on the joint  application in accordance with the food stamp processing time frames  from the date the joint application was initially accepted by the State  agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Privacy Act statement. As a State agency, you must notify all  households applying and being recertified for food stamp benefits of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The collection of this information, including the social  security number (SSN) of each household member, is authorized under the  Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2011-2036. The information  will be used to determine whether your household is eligible or  continues to be eligible to participate in the Food Stamp Program. We  will verify this information through computer matching programs. This  information will also be used to monitor compliance with program  regulations and for program management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This information may be disclosed to other Federal and State  agencies for official examination, and to law enforcement officials for  the purpose of apprehending persons fleeing to avoid the law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a food stamp claim arises against your household, the  information on this application, including all SSNs, may be referred to  Federal and State agencies, as well as private claims collection  agencies, for claims collection action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Providing the requested information, including the SSN of each  household member, is voluntary. However, failure to provide an SSN will  result in the denial of food stamp benefits to each individual failing  to provide an SSN. Any SSNs provided will be used and disclosed in the  same manner as SSNs of eligible household members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Filing an application--(1) Household's right to file. Households  must file food stamp applications by submitting the forms to the food  stamp office either in person, through an authorized representative, by  fax or other electronic transmission, by mail, or by completing an on- line electronic application. The State agency must provide households  that complete an on-line electronic application in person at the food  stamp office the opportunity to review the information that has been  recorded electronically and must provide them with a copy of that  information for their records. Applications signed through the use of  electronic signature techniques or applications containing a handwritten  signature and then transmitted by fax or other electronic transmission  are acceptable. State agencies must document the date the application  was filed by recording the date of receipt at the food stamp office.  When a resident of an institution is jointly applying for SSI and food  stamps prior to leaving the institution, the filing date of the  application that the State agency must record is the date of release of  the applicant from the institution. The length of time a State agency  has to deliver benefits is calculated from the date the application is  filed in the food stamp office designated by the State agency to accept  the household's application, except when a resident of a public  institution is jointly applying for SSI and food stamps prior to his/her  release from an institution in accordance with Sec. 273.1(e)(2).  Residents of public institutions who apply for foods stamps prior to  their release from the institution shall be certified in accordance with  Sec. 273.2(g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or Sec. 273.2(i)(3)(i), as appropriate. Each household  has the right to file an application form on the same day it contacts  the food stamp office during office hours. The household shall be  advised that it does not have to be interviewed before filing the  application and may file an incomplete application form as long as the  form contains the applicant's name and address, and is signed by a  responsible member of the household or the household's authorized  representative. State agencies shall document the date the application  was filed by recording on   the application the date it was received by the food stamp office. When  a resident of an institution is jointly applying for SSI and food stamps  prior to leaving the institution, the filing date of the application to  be recorded by the State agency on the food stamp application is the  date of release of the applicant from the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contacting the food stamp office. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State agencies shall  encourage households to file an application form the same day the  household or its representative contacts the food stamp office in person  or by telephone and expresses interest in obtaining food stamp  assistance or expresses concerns which indicate food insecurity. If the  State agency attempts to discourage households from applying for cash  assistance, it shall make clear that the disadvantages and requirements  of applying for cash assistance do not apply to food stamps. In  addition, it shall encourage applicants to continue with their  application for food stamps. The State agency shall inform households  that receiving food stamps will have no bearing on any other program's  time limits that may apply to the household. If a household contacting  the food stamp office by telephone does not wish to come to the  appropriate office to file the application that same day and instead  prefers receiving an application through the mail, the State agency  shall mail an application form to the household on the same day the  telephone request is received. An application shall also be mailed on  the same day a written request for food assistance is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where a project area has designated certification offices to  serve specific geographic areas, households may contact an office other  than the one designated to service the area in which they reside. When a  household contacts the wrong certification office within a project area  in person or by telephone, the certification office shall, in addition  to meeting other requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section,  give the household the address and telephone number of the appropriate  office. The certification office shall also offer to forward the  household's application to the appropriate office that same day if the  household has completed enough information on the application to file or  forward it the next day by any means that ensures the application  arrives at the application office the day it is forwarded. The household  shall be informed that its application will not be considered filed and  the processing standards shall not begin until the application is  received by the appropriate office. If the household has mailed its  application to the wrong office within a project area, the certification  office shall mail the application to the appropriate office on the same  day, or forward it the next day by any means that ensures the  application arrives at the application office the day it is forwarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In State agencies that elect to have Statewide residency, as  provided in Sec. 273.3, the application processing timeframes begin when  the application is filed in any food stamp office in the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Availability of the application form. The State agency shall  make application forms readily accessible to potentially eligible  households. The State agency shall also provide an application form to  anyone who requests the form. If the State agency maintains a Web page,  it must make the application available on the Web page in each language  in which the State agency makes a printed application available. The  State agency must provide on the Web page the addresses and phone  numbers of all State food stamp offices and a statement that the  household should return the application form to its nearest local  office. The applications must be accessible to persons with disabilities  in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Public  Law 93-112, as amended by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974,  Public Law 93-516, 29 U.S.C. 794. Regardless of the type of system the  State agency uses (paper or electronic), the State agency must provide a  means for applicants to immediately begin the application process with  name, address and signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notice of right to file. The State agency shall post signs in  the certification office which explain the application processing  standards and the right   to file an application on the day of initial contact. The State agency  shall include similar information about same day filing on the  application form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice of Required Verification. The State agency shall provide  each household at the time of application for certification and  recertification with a notice that informs the household of the  verification requirements the household must meet as part of the  application process. The notice shall also inform the household of the  State agency's responsibility to assist the household in obtaining  required verification provided the household is cooperating with the  State agency as specified in (d)(1) of this section. The notice shall be  written in clear and simple language and shall meet the bilingual  requirements designated in Sec. 272.4(b) of this chapter. At a minimum,  the notice shall contain examples of the types of documents the  household should provide and explain the period of time the documents  should cover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Withdrawing application. The household may voluntarily withdraw  its application at any time prior to the determination of eligibility.  The State agency shall document in the case file the reason for  withdrawal, if any was stated by the household, and that contact was  made with the household to confirm the withdrawal. The household shall  be advised of its right to reapply at any time subsequent to a  withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Household cooperation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To determine eligibility, the  application form must be completed and signed, the household or its  authorized representative must be interviewed, and certain information  on the application must be verified. If the household refuses to  cooperate with the State agency in completing this process, the  application shall be denied at the time of refusal. For a determination  of refusal to be made, the household must be able to cooperate, but  clearly demonstrate that it will not take actions that it can take and  that are required to complete the application process. For example, to  be denied for refusal to cooperate, a household must refuse to be  interviewed not merely failing to appear for the interview. If there is  any question as to whether the household has merely failed to cooperate,  as opposed to refused to cooperate, the household shall not be denied,  and the agency shall provide assistance required by paragraph (c)(5) of  this section. The household shall also be determined ineligible if it  refuses to cooperate in any subsequent review of its eligibility,  including reviews generated by reported changes and applications for  recertification. Once denied or terminated for refusal to cooperate, the  household may reapply but shall not be determined eligible until it  cooperates with the State agency. The State agency shall not determine  the household to be ineligible when a person outside of the household  fails to cooperate with a request for verification. The State agency  shall not consider individuals identified as nonhousehold members under  Sec. 273.1(b)(2) as individuals outside the household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cooperation with QC Reviewer. In addition, the household shall  be determined ineligible if it refuses to cooperate in any subsequent  review of its eligibility as a part of a quality control review. If a  household is terminated for refusal to cooperate with a quality control  reviewer, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 275.3(c)(5) and 275.12(g)(1)(ii)  of this chapter, the household may reapply, but shall not be determined  eligible until it cooperates with the quality control reviewer. If a  household terminated for refusal to cooperate with a State quality  control reviewer reapplies after 125 days from the end of the annual  review period, the household shall not be determined ineligible for its  refusal to cooperate with a State quality control reviewer during the  completed review period, but must provide verification in accordance  with paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section. If a household terminated for  refusal to cooperate with a Federal quality control reviewer reapplies  after nine months from the end of the annual review period, the  household shall not be determined ineligible for its refusal to  cooperate with a Federal quality control reviewer during the completed  review period, but must provide verification in accordance with  paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section. In the event that one or   more household members no longer resides with a household terminated for  refusal to cooperate, the penalty for refusal to cooperate will attach  to household of the person(s) who refused to cooperate. If the State  agency is unable to determine which household member(s) refused to  cooperate, the State agency shall determine the household to which the  penalty shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section,  households must have a face-to-face interview with an eligibility worker  at initial certification and at least once every 12 months thereafter.  State agencies may not require households to report for an in-office  interview during their certification period, though they may request  households to do so. For example, State agencies may not require  households to report en masse for an in-office interview during their  certification periods simply to review their case files, or for any  other reason. Interviews may be conducted at the food stamp office or  other mutually acceptable location, including a household's residence.  If the interview will be conducted at the household's residence, it must  be scheduled in advance with the household. If a household in which all  adult members are elderly or disabled is certified for 24 months in  accordance with Sec. 273.10(f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, or a household residing on a  reservation is required to submit monthly reports and is certified for  24 months in accordance with Sec. 273.10(f)(2), a face-to-face interview  is not required during the certification period. The individual  interviewed may be the head of household, spouse, any other responsible  member of the household, or an authorized representative. The applicant  may bring any person he or she chooses to the interview. The interviewer  must not simply review the information that appears on the application,  but must explore and resolve with the household unclear and incomplete  information. The interviewer must advise households of their rights and  responsibilities during the interview, including the appropriate  application processing standard and the households' responsibility to  report changes. The interviewer must advise households that are also  applying for or receiving PA benefits that time limits and other  requirements that apply to the receipt of PA benefits do not apply to  the receipt of food stamp benefits, and that households which cease  receiving PA benefits because they have reached a time limit, have begun  working, or for other reasons, may still qualify for food stamp  benefits. The interviewer must conduct the interview as an official and  confidential discussion of household circumstances. The State agency  must protect the applicant's right to privacy during the interview.  Facilities must be adequate to preserve the privacy and confidentiality  of the interview.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency must notify the applicant that it will waive  the face-to-face interview required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section  in favor of a telephone interview on a case-by-case basis because of  household hardship situations as determined by the State agency. These  hardship conditions include, but are not limited to: Illness,  transportation difficulties, care of a household member, hardships due  to residency in a rural area, prolonged severe weather, or work or  training hours which prevent the household from participating in an in- office interview. The State agency must document the case file to show  when a waiver was granted because of a hardship. The State agency may  opt to waive the face-to-face interview in favor of a telephone  interview for all households which have no earned income and all members  of the household are elderly or disabled. Regardless of any approved  waivers, the State agency must grant a face-to-face interview to any  household which requests one. The State agency has the option of  conducting a telephone interview or a home visit that is scheduled in  advance with the household if the office interview is waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Waiver of the face-to-face interview does not exempt the  household from the verification requirements, although special  procedures may be used to permit the household to provide verification  and thus obtain its benefits in a timely manner, such as substituting a  collateral contact in cases where documentary verification would  normally be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver of the face-to-face interview may not affect the length  of the household's certification period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency must schedule an interview for all applicant  households who are not interviewed on the day they submit their  applications. To the extent practicable, the State agency must schedule  the interview to accommodate the needs of groups with special  circumstances, including working households. The State agency must  schedule all interviews as promptly as possible to insure eligible  households receive an opportunity to participate within 30 days after  the application is filed. The State agency must notify each household  that misses its interview appointment that it missed the scheduled  interview and that the household is responsible for rescheduling a  missed interview. If the household contacts the State agency within the  30 day application processing period, the State agency must schedule a  second interview. The State agency may not deny a household's  application prior to the 30th day after application if the household  fails to appear for the first scheduled interview. If the household  requests a second interview during the 30-day application processing  period and is determined eligible, the State agency must issue prorated  benefits from the date of application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Verification. Verification is the use of documentation or a  contact with a third party to confirm the accuracy of statements or  information. The State agency must give households at least 10 days to  provide required verification. Paragraph (i)(4) of this section contains  verification procedures for expedited service cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory verification. State agencies shall verify the  following information prior to certification for households initially  applying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross nonexempt income. Gross nonexempt income shall be verified  for all households prior to certification. However, where all attempts  to verify the income have been unsuccessful because the person or  organization providing the income has failed to cooperate with the  household and the State agency, and all other sources of verification  are unavailable, the eligibility worker shall determine an amount to be  used for certification purposes based on the best available information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alien eligibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency must verify the  eligible status of applicant aliens. If an alien does not wish the State  agency to contact INS to verify his or her immigration status, the State  agency must give the household the option of withdrawing its application  or participating without that member. The Department of Justice (DOJ)  Interim Guidance On Verification of Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status  and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Interim Guidance) (62 FR 61344,  November 17, 1997) contains information on acceptable documents and INS  codes. State agencies should use the Interim Guidance until DOJ  publishes a final rule on this issue. Thereafter, State agencies should  consult both the Interim Guidance and the DOJ final rule. Where the  Interim Guidance and the DOJ final rule conflict, the latter should  control the verification of alien eligibility. As provided in  Sec. 273.4, the following information may also be relevant to the  eligibility of some aliens: date of admission or date status was  granted; military connection; battered status; if the alien was lawfully  residing in the United States on August 22, 1996; membership in certain  Indian tribes; if the person was age 65 or older on August 22, 1996; if  a lawful permanent resident can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters  of covered work and if any Federal means-tested public benefits were  received in any quarter after December 31, 1996; or if the alien was a  member of certain Hmong or Highland Laotian tribes during a certain  period of time or is the spouse or unmarried dependent of such a person.  The State agency must also verify these factors, if applicable to the  alien's eligibility. The SSA Quarters of Coverage History System (QCHS)  is available for purposes of verifying whether a lawful permanent  resident has earned or can receive credit for a total of 40 qualifying  quarters. However, the QCHS may not show all qualifying quarters. For  instance, SSA records do not show current year earnings and in some  cases the last year's   earnings, depending on the time of request. Also, in some cases, an  applicant may have work from uncovered employment that is not documented  by SSA, but is countable toward the 40 quarters test. In both these  cases, the individual, rather than SSA, would need to provide the  evidence needed to verify the quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An alien is ineligible until acceptable documentation is  provided unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State agency has submitted a copy of a document provided by  the household to INS for verification. Pending such verification, the  State agency cannot delay, deny, reduce or terminate the individual's  eligibility for benefits on the basis of the individual's immigration  status; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant or the State agency has submitted a request to SSA  for information regarding the number of quarters of work that can be  credited to the individual, SSA has responded that the individual has  fewer than 40 quarters, and the individual provides documentation from  SSA that SSA is conducting an investigation to determine if more  quarters can be credited. If SSA indicates that the number of qualifying  quarters that can be credited is under investigation, the State agency  must certify the individual pending the results of the investigation for  up to 6 months from the date of the original determination of  insufficient quarters; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant or the State agency has submitted a request to a  Federal agency for verification of information which bears on the  individual's eligible alien status. The State agency must certify the  individual pending the results of the investigation for up to 6 months  from the date of the original request for verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The State agency must provide alien applicants with a reasonable  opportunity to submit acceptable documentation of their eligible alien  status as of the 30th day following the date of application. A  reasonable opportunity must be at least 10 days from the date of the  State agency's request for an acceptable document. When the State agency  fails to provide an alien applicant with a reasonable opportunity as of  the 30th day following the date of application, the State agency must  provide the household with benefits no later than 30 days following the  date of application, provided the household is otherwise eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Utility expenses. The State agency shall verify a household's  utility expenses if the household wishes to claim expenses in excess of  the State agency's utility standard and the expense would actually  result in a deduction. If the household's actual utility expenses cannot  be verified before the 30 days allowed to process the application  expire, the State agency shall use the standard utility allowance,  provided the household is entitled to use the standard as specified in  Sec. 273.9(d). If the household wishes to claim expenses for an  unoccupied home, the State agency shall verify the household's actual  utility expenses for the unoccupied home in every case and shall not use  the standard utility allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Medical expenses. The amount of any medical expenses (including  the amount of reimbursements) deductible under Sec. 273.9(d)(3) shall be  verified prior to initial certification. Verification of other factors,  such as the allowability of services provided or the eligibility of the  person incurring the cost, shall be required if questionable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Social security numbers. The State agency shall verify the  social security number(s) (SSN) reported by the household by submitting  them to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for verification  according to procedures established by SSA. The State agency shall not  delay the certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise  eligible household solely to verify the SSN of a household member. Once  an SSN has been verified, the State agency shall make a permanent  annotation to its file to prevent the unnecessary reverification of the  SSN in the future. The State agency shall accept as verified an SSN  which has been verified by another program participating in the IEVS  described in Sec. 272.8. If an individual is unable to provide an SSN or  does not have an SSN, the State agency shall require the individual to  submit Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Number, to the SSA  in accordance with procedures in Sec. 273.6. A   completed SSA Form 2853 shall be considered proof of application for an  SSN for a newborn infant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Residency. The residency requirements of Sec. 273.3 shall be  verified except in unusual cases (such as homeless households, some  migrant farmworker households, or households newly arrived in a project  area) where verification of residency cannot reasonably be accomplished.  Verification of residency should be accomplished to the extent possible  in conjunction with the verification of other information such as, but  not limited to, rent and mortgage payments, utility expenses, and  identity. If verification cannot be accomplished in conjunction with the  verification of other information, then the State agency shall use a  collateral contact or other readily available documentary evidence.  Documents used to verify other factors of eligibility should normally  suffice to verify residency as well. Any documents or collateral contact  which reasonably establish the applicant's residency must be accepted  and no requirement for a specific type of verification may be imposed.  No durational residency requirement shall be established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Identity. The identity of the person making application shall  be verified. Where an authorized representative applies on behalf of a  household, the identity of both the authorized representative and the  head of household shall be verified. Identity may be verified through  readily available documentary evidence, or if this is unavailable,  through a collateral contact. Examples of acceptable documentary  evidence which the applicant may provide include, but are not limited  to, a driver's license, a work or school ID, an ID for health benefits  or for another assistance or social services program, a voter  registration card, wage stubs, or a birth certificate. Any documents  which reasonably establish the applicant's identity must be accepted,  and no requirement for a specific type of document, such as a birth  certificate, may be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Disability. (A) The State agency shall verify disability as  defined in Sec. 271.2 as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraphs (2),  (3) and (4) of the definition, the household shall provide proof that  the disabled individual is receiving benefits under titles I, II, X, XIV  or XVI of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraph (6) of  the definition, the household must present a statement from the Veterans  Administration (VA) which clearly indicates that the disabled individual  is receiving VA disability benefits for a service-connected or non- service-connected disability and that the disability is rated as total  or paid at the total rate by VA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraphs (7)  and (8) of the definition, proof by the household that the disabled  individual is receiving VA disability benefits is sufficient  verification of disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraphs (5)  and (9) of the definition, the State agency shall use the Social  Security Administration's (SSA) most current list of disabilities  considered permanent under the Social Security Act for verifying  disability. If it is obvious to the caseworker that the individual has  one of the listed disabilities, the household shall be considered to  have verified disability. If disability is not obvious to the  caseworker, the household shall provide a statement from a physician or  licensed or certified psychologist certifying that the individual has  one of the nonobvious disabilities listed as the means for verifying  disability under paragraphs (5) and (9) of the definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraph (10)  of the definition, the household shall provide proof that the individual  receives a Railroad Retirement disability annuity from the Railroad  Retirement Board and has been determined to qualify for Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For individuals to be considered disabled under paragraph (11)  of the definition, the household shall provide proof that the individual  receives interim assistance benefits pending the receipt of Supplemental  Security Income; or disability-related medical assistance under title  XIX of the SSA; or   disability-based State general assistance benefits. The State agency  shall verify that the eligibility to receive these benefits is based  upon disability or blindness criteria which are at least as stringent as  those used under title XVI of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For disability determinations which must be made relevant to the  provisions of Sec. 273.1(a)(2)(ii), the State agency shall use the SSA's  most current list of disabilities as the initial step for verifying if  an individual has a disability considered permanent under the Social  Security Act. However, only those individuals who suffer from one of the  disabilities mentioned in the SSA list who are unable to purchase and  prepare meals because of such disability shall be considered disabled  for the purpose of this provision. If it is obvious to the caseworker  that the individual is unable to purchase and prepare meals because he/ she suffers from a severe physical or mental disability, the individual  shall be considered disabled for the purpose of the provision even if  the disability is not specifically mentioned on the SSA list. If the  disability is not obvious to the caseworker, he/she shall verify the  disability by requiring a statement from a physician or licensed or  certified psychologist certifying that the individual (in the  physician's/psychologist's opinion) is unable to purchase and prepare  meals because he/she suffers from one of the nonobvious disabilities  mentioned in the SSA list or is unable to purchase meals because he/she  suffers from some other severe, permanent physical or mental disease or  nondisease-related disability. The elderly and disabled individual (or  his/her authorized representative) shall be responsible for obtaining  the cooperation of the individuals with whom he/she resides in providing  the necessary income information about the others to the State agency  for purposes of this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> State agencies shall verify all factors of eligibility for  households who have been terminated for refusal to cooperate with a  State quality control reviewer, and reapply after 95 days from the end  of the annual review period. State agencies shall verify all factors of  eligibility for households who have been terminated for refusal to  cooperate with a Federal quality control reviewer and reapply after  seven months from the end of the annual review period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Household composition. State agencies shall verify factors  affecting the composition of a household, if questionable. Individuals  who claim to be a separate household from those with whom they reside  shall be responsible for proving that they are a separate household to  the satisfaction of the State agency. Individuals who claim to be a  separate household from those with whom they reside based on the various  age and disability factors for determining separateness shall be  responsible for proving a claim of separateness (at the State agency's  request) in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 273.2(f)(1)(viii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Students. If a person claims to be physically or mentally unfit  for purposes of the student exemption contained in Sec. 273.5(b)(2) and  the unfitness is not evident to the State agency, verification may be  required. Appropriate verification may consist of receipt of temporary  or permanent disability benefits issued by governmental or private  sources, or of a statement from a physician or licensed or certified  psychologist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> must specify in  their State plan of operation that they have selected this option. The  State agency shall give the household an opportunity to resolve any  discrepancy between household verification and CSE records in accordance  with paragraph (f)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Additional verification for able-bodied adults subject to the  time limit. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hours worked. For individuals subject to the food stamp  time limit of Sec. 273.24 who are satisfying the work requirement by  working, by combining work and participation in a work program, or by  participating in a work or workfare program that is not operated or  supervised by the State agency, the individuals' work hours shall be  verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Countable months in another state. For individuals subject to  the food stamp time limit of Sec. 273.24, the State agency must verify  the number of countable months (as defined in Sec. 273.24(b)(1)) an  individual has used in another State if there is an indication that the  individual participated in that State. The normal processing standards  of 7 CFR 273.2(g) apply. The State agency may accept another State  agency's assertion as to the number of countable months an individual  has used in another State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Verification of questionable information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency  shall verify, prior to certification of the household, all other factors  of eligibility which the State agency determines are questionable and  affect the household's eligibility and benefit level. The State agency  shall establish guidelines to be followed in determining what shall be  considered questionable information. These guidelines shall not  prescribe verification based on race, religion, ethnic background, or  national origin. These guidelines shall not target groups such as  migrant farmworkers or American Indians for more intensive verification  under this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a member's citizenship or status as a non-citizen national  is questionable, the State agency must verify the member's citizenship  or non-citizen national status in accordance with attachment 4 of the  DOJ Interim Guidance. After DOJ issues final rules, State agencies  should consult both the Interim Guidance and the final rule. Where the  Interim Guidance and the DOJ final rule conflict, the latter should  control the eligibility determination. The State agency must accept  participation in another program as acceptable verification if  verification of citizenship or non-citizen national status was obtained  for that program. If the household cannot obtain the forms of  verification suggested in attachment 4 of the DOJ Interim Guidance and  the household can provide a reasonable explanation as to why  verification is not available, the State agency must accept a signed  statement, under penalty of perjury, from a third party indicating a  reasonable basis for personal knowledge that the member in question is a  U.S. citizen or non-citizen national. The signed statement must contain  a warning of the penalties for helping someone commit fraud. Absent  verification or third party attestation of U.S. citizenship or non- citizen national status, the member whose citizenship or non-citizen  national status is in question is ineligible to participate until the  issue is resolved. The member whose citizenship or non-citizen national  status is in question will have his or her income and resources  considered available to any remaining household members as set forth in  Sec. 273.11(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State agency options. In addition to the verification required  in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, the State agency may  elect to mandate verification of any other factor which affects  household eligibility or allotment level, including household size where  not questionable. Such verification may be required Statewide   or throughout a project area, but shall not be imposed on a selective,  case-by-case basis on particular households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency may establish its own standards for the use of  verification, provided that, at a minimum, all questionable factors are  verified in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section and that  such standards do not allow for inadvertent discrimination. For example,  no standard may be applied which prescribes variances in verification  based on race, religion, ethnic background or national origin, nor may a  State standard target groups such as migrant farmworkers or American  Indians for more intensive verification than other households. The  options specified in this paragraph, shall not apply in those offices of  the Social Security Administration (SSA) which, in accordance with  paragraph (k) of this section, provide for the food stamp certification  of households containing recipients of Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) and social security benefits. The State agency, however, may  negotiate with those SSA offices with regard to mandating verification  of these options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a State agency opts to verify a deductible expense and  obtaining the verification may delay the household's certification, the  State agency shall advise the household that its eligibility and benefit  level may be determined without providing a deduction for the claimed  but unverified expense. This provision also applies to the allowance of  medical expenses as specified in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.  Shelter costs would be computed without including the unverified  components. The standard utility allowance shall be used if the  household is entitled to claim it and has not verified higher actual  costs. If the expense cannot be verified within 30 days of the date of  application, the State agency shall determine the household's  eligibility and benefit level without providing a deduction of the  unverified expense. If the household subsequently provides the missing  verification, the State agency shall redetermine the household's  benefits, and provide increased benefits, if any, in accordance with the  timeliness standards in Sec. 273.12 on reported changes. If the expense  could not be verified within the 30-day processing standard because the  State agency failed to allow the household sufficient time, as defined  in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, to verify the expense, the  household shall be entitled to the restoration of benefits retroactive  to the month of application, provided that the missing verification is  supplied in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section. If the  household would be ineligible unless the expense is allowed, the  household's application shall be handled as provided in paragraph (h) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sources of verification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Documentary evidence. State  agencies shall use documentary evidence as the primary source of  verification for all items except residency and household size. These  items may be verified either through readily available documentary  evidence or through a collateral contact, without a requirement being  imposed that documentary evidence must be the primary source of  verification. Documentary evidence consists of a written confirmation of  a household's circumstances. Examples of documentary evidence include  wage stubs, rent receipts, and utility bills. Although documentary  evidence shall be the primary source of verification, acceptable  verification shall not be limited to any single type of document and may  be obtained through the household or other source. Whenever documentary  evidence cannot be obtained or is insufficient to make a firm  determination of eligibility or benefit level, the eligibility worker  may require collateral contacts or home visits. For example, documentary  evidence may be considered insufficient when the household presents pay  stubs which do not represent an accurate picture of the household's  income (such as out-dated pay stubs) or identification papers that  appear to be falsified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collateral contacts. A collateral contact is an oral  confirmation of a household's circumstances by a person outside of the  household. The collateral contact may be made either in person or over  the telephone. The State agency may select a collateral contact if the  household fails to designate one or designates one which is unacceptable  to the State agency. Examples of   acceptable collateral contacts may include employers, landlords, social  service agencies, migrant service agencies, and neighbors of the  household who can be expected to provide accurate third-party  verification. When talking with collateral contacts, State agencies  should disclose only the information that is absolutely necessary to get  the information being sought. State agencies should avoid disclosing  that the household has applied for food stamps, nor should they disclose  any information supplied by the household, especially information that  is protected by Sec. 273.1(c), or suggest that the household is  suspected of any wrong doing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Home visits. Home visits may be used as verification only when  documentary evidence is insufficient to make a firm determination of  eligibility or benefit level, or cannot be obtained, and the home visit  is scheduled in advance with the household. Home visits are to be used  on a case-by-case basis where the supplied documentation is  insufficient. Simply because a household fits a profile of an error- prone household does not constitute lack of verification. State agencies  shall assist households in obtaining sufficient verification in  accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Discrepancies. Where unverified information from a source other  than the household contradicts statements made by the household, the  household shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to resolve the  discrepancy prior to a determination of eligibility or benefits. The  State agency may, if it chooses, verify the information directly and  contact the household only if such direct verification efforts are  unsuccessful. If the unverified information is received through the  IEVS, as specified in Sec. 272.8, the State agency may obtain  verification from a third party as specified in paragraph (f)(9)(v) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Homeless households. Homeless households claiming actual shelter  expenses or those with extremely low shelter costs may provide  verification of their shelter expenses to qualify for the homeless  shelter deduction if the State agency has such a deduction. If a  homeless household has difficulty in obtaining traditional types of  verification of shelter costs, the caseworker shall use prudent judgment  in determining if the verification obtained is adequate. For example, if  a homeless individual claims to have incurred shelter costs for several  nights and the costs are comparable to costs typically incurred by  homeless people for shelter, the caseworker may decide to accept this  information as adequate information and not require further  verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Responsibility of obtaining verification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The household has  primary responsibility for providing documentary evidence to support  statements on the application and to resolve any questionable  information. The State agency must assist the household in obtaining  this verification provided the household is cooperating with the State  agency as specified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Households  may supply documentary evidence in person, through the mail, by  facsimile or other electronic device, or through an authorized  representative. The State agency must not require the household to  present verification in person at the food stamp office. The State  agency must accept any reasonable documentary evidence provided by the  household and must be primarily concerned with how adequately the  verification proves the statements on the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever documentary evidence is insufficient to make a firm  determination of eligibility or benefit level, or cannot be obtained,  the State agency may require a collateral contact or a home visit in  accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. The State agency,  generally, shall rely on the household to provide the name of any  collateral contact. The household may request assistance in designating  a collateral contact. The State agency is not required to use a  collateral contact designated by the household if the collateral contact  cannot be expected to provide an accurate third-party verification. When  the collateral contact designated by the household is unacceptable, the  State agency shall either designate another collateral contact, ask the  household to designate   another collateral contact or to provide an alternative form of  verification, or substitute a home visit. The State agency is  responsible for obtaining verification from acceptable collateral  contacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Documentation. Case files must be documented to support  eligibility, ineligibility, and benefit level determinations.  Documentation shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reviewer to  determine the reasonableness and accuracy of the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> State Data Exchange and Beneficiary Data Exchange. The State  agency may verify SSI benefits through the State Data Exchange (SDX),  and Social Security benefit information through the Beneficiary Data  Exchange (BENDEX), or through verification provided by the household.  The State agency may use SDX and BENDEX data to verify other food stamp  eligibility criteria. The State agency may access SDX and BENDEX data  without release statements from households, provided the State agency  makes the appropriate data request to SSA and executes the necessary  data exchange agreements with SSA. The household shall be given an  opportunity to verify the information from another source if the SDX or  BENDEX information is contradictory to the information provided by the  household or is unavailable. Determination of the household's  eligibility and benefit level shall not be delayed past the application  processing time standards of paragraph (g) of this section if SDX or  BENDEX data is unavailable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> must specify  in their State plan of operation that they have selected this option.  For all other households eligible for the child support deduction or  exclusion, the State agency shall require the household to verify any  changes in the legal obligation to pay child support, the obligated  amount, and the amount of legally obligated child support a household  member pays to a nonhousehold member. The State agency shall verify  reportedly unchanged child support information only if the information  is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Newly obtained social security numbers shall be verified at  recertification in accordance with verification procedures outlined in  Sec. 273.2(f)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For individuals subject to the food stamp time limit of  Sec. 273.24 who are satisfying the work requirement by working, by  combining work and participation in a work program, or by participating  in a work program that is not operated or supervised by the State  agency, the individuals' work hours shall be verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other information which has changed may be verified at  recertification. Unchanged information shall not be verified unless the  information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated.  Verification under this   paragraph shall be subject to the same verification procedures as apply  during initial verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes. Changes reported during the certification period shall  be subject to the same verification procedures as apply at initial  certification, except that the State agency shall not verify changes in  income if the source has not changed and if the amount has changed by  $50 or less, unless the information is incomplete, inaccurate,  inconsistent or outdated. The State agency shall also not verify total  medical expenses or actual utility expenses which are unchanged or have  changed by $25 or less, unless the information is incomplete,  inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Optional use of IEVS. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency may obtain  information through IEVS in accordance with procedures specified in  Sec. 272.8 of this chapter and use it to verify the eligibility and  benefit levels of applicants and participating households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency may access data through the IEVS provided the  disclosure safeguards and data exchange agreements required by part 272  are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency shall take action, including proper notices  to households, to terminate, deny, or reduce benefits based on  information obtain through the IEVS which is considered verified upon  receipt. This information is social security and SSI benefit information  obtained from SSA, and TANF benefit information and UIB information  obtained from the agencies administering those programs. If the State  agency has information that the IEVS-obtained information about a  particular household is questionable, this information shall be  considered unverified upon receipt and the State agency shall take  action as specified in paragraph (f)(9)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except as noted in this paragraph, prior to taking action to  terminate, deny, or reduce benefits based on information obtained  through the IEVS which is considered unverified upon receipt, State  agencies shall independently verify the information. Such unverified  information is unearned income information from IRS, wage information  from SSA and SWICAs, and questionable IEVS information discussed in  paragraph (f)(9)(iii) of this section. Independent verification shall  include verification of the amount of the asset or income involved,  whether the household actually has or had access to such asset or income  such that it would be countable income or resources for food stamp  purposes, and the period during which such access occurred. Except with  respect to unearned income information from IRS, if a State agency has  information which indicates that independent verification is not needed,  such verification is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The State agency shall obtain independent verification of  unverified information obtained from IEVS by means of contacting the  household and/or the appropriate income, resource or benefit source. If  the State agency chooses to contact the household, it must do so in  writing, informing the household of the information which it has  received, and requesting that the household respond within 10 days. If  the household fails to respond in a timely manner, the State agency  shall send it a notice of adverse action as specified in Sec. 273.13.  The State agency may contact the appropriate source by the means best  suited to the situation. When the household or appropriate source  provides the independent verification, the State agency shall properly  notify the household of the action it intends to take and provide the  household with an opportunity to request a fair hearing prior to any  adverse action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Optional use of SAVE. Households are required to submit  documents to verify the immigration status of applicant aliens. State  agencies that verify the validity of such documents through the INS SAVE  system in accordance with Sec. 272.11 of this chapter must use the  following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall provide an applicant alien with a  reasonable opportunity to submit acceptable documentation of their  eligible alien status prior to the 30th day following the date of  application. A reasonable opportunity shall be at least 10 days from the  date of the State agency's request for an acceptable document. An alien   who has been given a reasonable opportunity to submit acceptable  documentation and has not done so as of the 30th day following the date  of application shall not be certified for benefits until acceptable  documentation has been submitted. However, if the 10-day reasonable  opportunity period provided by the State agency does not lapse before  the 30th day following the date of application, the State agency shall  provide the household with benefits no later than 30 days following the  date of application Provided the household is otherwise eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The written consent of the alien applicant shall not be  required as a condition for the State agency to contact INS to verify  the validity of documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State agencies which access the ASVI database through an  automated access shall also submit INS Form G-845, with an attached  photocopy of the alien's document, to INS whenever the initial automated  access does not confirm the validity of the alien's documentation or a  significant discrepancy exists between the data provided by the ASVI and  the information provided by the applicant. Pending such responses from  either the ASVI or INS Form G-845, the State agency shall not delay,  deny, reduce, or terminate the alien's eligibility for benefits on the  basis of the individual's alien status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the State agency determines, after complying with the  requirements of this section, that the alien is not in an eligible alien  status, the State agency shall take action, including proper notices to  the household, to terminate, deny or reduce benefits. The State agency  shall provide households the opportunity to request a fair hearing under  Sec. 273.15 prior to any adverse action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The use of SAVE shall be documented in the casefile or other  agency records. When the State agency is waiting for a response from  SAVE, agency records shall contain either a notation showing the date of  the State agency's transmission or a copy of the INS Form G-845 sent to  INS. Once the SAVE response is received, agency records shall show  documentation of the ASVI Query Verification Number or contain a copy of  the INS-annotated Form G-845. Whenever the response from automated  access to the ASVI directs the eligibility worker to initiate secondary  verification, agency records shall show documentation of the ASVI Query  Verification Number and contain a copy of the INS Form G-845.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Use of disqualification data. (i) Pursuant to Sec. 273.16</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>,  information in the disqualified recipient database will be available for  use by any State agency that executes a computer matching agreement with  FNS. The State agency shall use the disqualified recipient database for  the following purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ascertain the appropriate penalty to impose based on past  disqualifications in a case under consideration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conduct matches as specified in Sec. 273.16 on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Program application information prior to certification and for a  newly added household member whenever that might occur; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The current recipient caseload at the time of recertification  for a period of 1 year after the implementation date of this match.  State agencies do not need to include minors, as that term is defined by  each State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> States having the ability to conduct a one-time match of their  entire active caseload against active cases from the disqualified  recipient database may do so and be exempted from the 1-year requirement  to conduct matches at recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies shall not take any adverse action to terminate,  deny, suspend, or reduce benefits to an applicant, or SNAP recipient,  based on disqualified recipient match results unless the match  information has been independently verified. The State agency shall  provide to an applicant, or recipient, an opportunity to contest any  adverse disqualified recipient match result pursuant to the provisions  of Sec. 273.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Independent verification shall take place separate from and  prior to issuing a notice of adverse action--a two-step process.  Independent verification for disqualification purposes means contacting  the applicant or recipient household and/or the State agency that  originated the disqualification record immediately to obtain   corroborating information or documentation to support the reported  disqualification information in the intentional Program violation  database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Documentation may be in any form deemed appropriate and legally  sufficient by the State agency considering the adverse action. Such  documentation may include, but shall not be limited to, electronic or  hard copies of court decisions, administrative disqualification hearing  determinations, signed disqualification consent agreements or  administrative disqualification hearing waivers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A State may accept a verbal or written statement from another  State agency attesting to the existence of the documentation listed in  paragraph (f)(11)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A State may accept a verbal or written statement from the  household affirming the accuracy of the disqualification information if  such a statement is properly documented and included in the case record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If a State agency is not able to provide independent  verification because of a lack of supporting documentation, the State  agency shall so advise the requesting State agency or FNS, as  appropriate, and shall take immediate action to remove the unsupported  record from the disqualified recipient database in accordance with  Sec. 273.16(i)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Once independent verification has been received, the requesting  State agency shall review and immediately enter the information into the  case record and send the appropriate notice(s) to the record subject and  any remaining members of the record subject's SNAP household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Information from the disqualified recipient database is subject  to the disclosure provisions in Sec. 272.1(c) of this chapter and the  routine uses described in the most recent ``Notice of Revision of  Privacy Act System of Records'' published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Normal processing standard--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Thirty-day processing. The State  agency shall provide eligible households that complete the initial  application process an opportunity to participate (as defined in  Sec. 274.2(b)) as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days  following the date the application was filed, except for residents of  public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits  prior to release from the institution in accordance with  Sec. 273.1(e)(2). An application is filed the day the appropriate food  stamp office receives an application containing the applicant's name and  address, which is signed by either a responsible member of the household  or the household's authorized representative. Households entitled to  expedited processing are specified in paragraph (i) of this section. For  residents of public institutions who apply for food stamps prior to  their release from the institution in accordance with Sec. 273.1(e)(2),  the State agency shall provide an opportunity to participate as soon as  possible, but not later than 30 calendar days from the date of release  of the applicant from the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Combined allotments. Households which apply for initial month  benefits (as described in Sec. 273.10(a)) after the 15th of the month,  are processed under normal processing timeframes, have completed the  application process within 30 days of the date of application, and have  been determined eligible to receive benefits for the initial month of  application and the next subsequent month, may be issued a combined  allotment at State agency option which includes prorated benefits for  the month of application and benefits for the first full month of  participation. The benefits shall be issued in accordance with  Sec. 274.2(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denying the application. Households that are found to be  ineligible shall be sent a notice of denial as soon as possible but not  later than 30 days following the date the application was filed. If the  household has failed to appear for a scheduled interviewand has made no  subsequent contact with the State agency to express interest in pursuing  the application, the State agency shall send the household a notice of  denial on the 30th day following the date of application. The household  must file a new application if it wishes to participate in the program.  In cases where the State agency was able to conduct an interview and  request all of the necessary verification on the same day the  application was filed, and no subsequent requests for verification have   been made, the State agency may also deny the application on the 30th  day if the State agency provided assistance to the household in  obtaining verification as specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this section,  but the household failed to provide the requested verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Delays in processing. If the State agency does not determine a  household's eligibility and provide an opportunity to participate within  30 days following the date the application was filed, the State agency  shall take the following action:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determining cause. The State agency shall first determine the  cause of the delay using the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A delay shall be considered the fault of the household if the  household has failed to complete the application process even though the  State agency has taken all the action it is required to take to assist  the household. The State agency must have taken the following actions  before a delay can be considered the fault of the household:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For households that have failed to complete the application  form, the State agency must have offered, or attempted to offer,  assistance in its completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If one or more members of the household have failed to register  for work, as required in Sec. 273.7, the State agency must have informed  the household of the need to register for work, determined if the  household members are exempt from work registration, and given the  household at least 10 days from the date of notification to register  these members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In cases where verification is incomplete, the State agency must  have provided the household with a statement of required verification  and offered to assist the household in obtaining required verification  and allowed the household sufficient time to provide the missing  verification. Sufficient time shall be at least 10 days from the date of  the State agency's initial request for the particular verification that  was missing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For households that have failed to appear for an interview, the  State agency must notify the household that it missed the scheduled  interview and that the household is responsible for rescheduling a  missed interview. If the household contacts the State agency within the  30 day processing period, the State agency must schedule a second  interview. If the household fails to schedule a second interview, or the  subsequent interview is postponed at the household's request or cannot  otherwise be rescheduled until after the 20th day but before the 30th  day following the date the application was filed, the household must  appear for the interview, bring verification, and register members for  work by the 30th day; otherwise, the delay shall be the fault of the  household. If the household has failed to appear for the first  interview, fails to schedule a second interview, and/or the subsequent  interview is postponed at the household's request until after the 30th  day following the date the application was filed, the delay shall be the  fault of the household. If the household has missed both scheduled  interviews and requests another interview, any delay shall be the fault  of the household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Delays that are the fault of the State agency include, but are  not limited to, those cases where the State agency failed to take the  actions described in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Delays caused by the household. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If by the 30th day the State  agency cannot take any further action on the application due to the  fault of the household, the household shall lose its entitlement to  benefits for the month of application. However, the State agency shall  give the household an additional 30 days to take the required action,  except that, if verification is lacking, the State agency has the option  of holding the application pending for only 30 days following the date  of the initial request for the particular verification that was missing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency has the option of sending the household either  a notice of denial or a notice of pending status on the 30th day. The  option chosen may vary from one project area to another, provided the  same procedures apply to all households within a project area. However,  if a notice of denial is sent and the household takes the required  action within 60 days following the date the application was   filed, the State agency shall reopen the case without requiring a new  application. No further action by the State agency is required after the  notice of denial or pending status is sent if the household failed to  take the required action within 60 days following the date the  application was filed, or if the State agency chooses the option of  holding the application pending for only 30 days following the date of  the initial request for the particular verification that was missing,  and the household fails to provide the necessary verification by this  30th day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> State agencies may include in the notice a request that the  household report all changes in circumstances since it filed its  application. The information that must be contained on the notice of  denial or pending status is explained in Sec. 273.10(g)(1) (ii) and  (iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the household was at fault for the delay in the first 30-day  period, but is found to be eligible during the second 30-day period, the  State agency shall provide benefits only from the month following the  month of application. The household is not entitled to benefits for the  month of application when the delay was the fault of the household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Delays caused by the State agency. (i) Whenever a delay in the  initial 30-day period is the fault of the State agency, the State agency  shall take immediate corrective action. Except as specified in  Sec. Sec. 273.2(f)(1)(ii)(F) and 273.2(f)(10)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, the State agency shall  not deny the application if it caused the delay, but shall instead  notify the household by the 30th day following the date the application  was filed that its application is being held pending. The State agency  shall also notify the household of any action it must take to complete  the application process. If verification is lacking the State agency has  the option of holding the application pending for only 30 days following  the date of the initial request for the particular verification that was  missing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the household is found to be eligible during the second 30- day period, the household shall be entitled to benefits retroactive to  the month of application. If, however, the household is found to be  ineligible, the State agency shall deny the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Delays beyond 60 days. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the State agency is at fault for  not completing the application process by the end of the second 30-day  period, and the case file is otherwise complete, the State agency shall  continue to process the original application until an eligibility  determination is reached. If the household is determined eligible, and  the State agency was at fault for the delay in the initial 30 days, the  household shall receive benefits retroactive to the month of  application. However, if the initial delay was the household's fault,  the household shall receive benefits retroactive only to the month  following the month of application. The State agency may use the  original application to determine the household's eligibility in the  months following the 60-day period, or it may require the household to  file a new application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the State agency is at fault for not completing the  application process by the end of the second 30-day period, but the case  file is not complete enough to reach an eligibility determination, the  State agency may continue to process the original application, or deny  the case and notify the household to file a new application. If the case  is denied, the household shall also be advised of its possible  entitlement to benefits lost as a result of State agency caused delays  in accordance with Sec. 273.17. If the State agency was also at fault  for the delay in the initial 30 days, the amount of benefits lost would  be calculated from the month of application. If, however, the household  was at fault for the initial delay, the amount of benefits lost would be  calculated from the month following the month of application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the household is at fault for not completing the  application process by the end of the second 30-day period, the State  agency shall deny the application and require the household to file a  new application if it wishes to participate. If however, the State  agency has chosen the option of holding the application pending only  until 30 days following the date of the initial request for the  particular verification that was missing, and verification is not  received by that 30th day, the State   agency may immediately close the application. A notice of denial need  not be sent if the notice of pending status informed the household that  it would have to file a new application if verification was not received  within 30 days of the initial request. The household shall not be  entitled to any lost benefits, even if the delay in the initial 30 days  was the fault of the State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Expedited service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Entitlement to expedited service. The  following households are entitled to expedited service:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Households with less than $150 in monthly gross income, as  computed in Sec. 273.10 provided their liquid resources (i.e., cash on  hand, checking or savings accounts, savings certificates, and lump sum  payments as specified in Sec. 273.9(c)(8)) do not exceed $100;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Migrant or seasonal farmworker households who are destitute as  defined in Sec. 273.10(e)(3) provided their liquid resources (i.e., cash  on hand, checking or savings accounts, savings certificates, and lump  sum payments as specified in Sec. 273.9(c)(8)) do not exceed $100;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Households whose combined monthly gross income and liquid  resources are less than the household's monthly rent or mortgage, and  utilities (including entitlement to a SUA, as appropriate, in accordance  with Sec. 273.9(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifying households needing expedited service. The State  agency's application procedures shall be designed to identify households  eligible for expedited service at the time the household requests  assistance. For example, a receptionist, volunteer, or other employee  shall be responsible for screening applications as they are filed or as  individuals come in to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Processing standards. All households receiving expedited  service, except those receiving it during months in which allotments are  suspended or cancelled, shall have their cases processed in accordance  with the following provisions. Those households receiving expedited  service during suspensions or cancellations shall have their cases  processed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 271.7(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. For households entitled to expedited service, the State  agency shall make available to the recipient coupons or an ATP card not  later than the seventh calendar day following the date an application  was filed. For a resident of a public institution who applies for  benefits prior to his/her release from the institution in accordance  with Sec. 273.1(e)(2) and who is entitled to expedited service, the date  of filing of his/her food stamp application is the date of release of  the applicant from the institution. Whatever system a State agency uses  to ensure meeting this delivery standard shall be designed to allow a  reasonable opportunity for redemption of ATPs no later than the seventh  calendar day following the day the application was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Drug addicts and alcoholics, group living arrangement  facilities. For residents of drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and  rehabilitation centers and residents of group living arrangements who  are entitled to expedited service, the State agency shall make available  to the recipient coupons or an ATP card not later than the 7 calendar  days following the date an application was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Out-of-office interviews. If a household is entitled to  expedited service and is also entitled to a waiver of the office  interview, the State agency shall conduct the interview (unless the  household cannot be reached) and complete the application process within  the expedited service standards. The first day of this count is the  calendar day following application filing. If the State agency conducts  a telephone interview and must mail the application to the household for  signature, the mailing time involved will not be calculated in the  expedited service standards. Mailing time shall only include the days  the application is in the mail to and from the household and the days  the application is in the household's possession pending signature and  mailing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Late determinations. If the prescreening required in paragraph  (i)(2) of this section fails to identify a household as being entitled  to expedited service and the State agency subsequently discovers that  the household is entitled to expedited service, the State agency shall  provide expedited   service to households within the processing standards described in  paragraphs (i)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, except that the  processing standard shall be calculated from the date the State agency  discovers the household is entitled to expedited service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Residents of shelters for battered women and children. Residents  of shelters for battered women and children who are otherwise entitled  to expedited service shall be handled in accordance with the time limits  in paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special procedures for expediting service. The State agency  shall use the following procedures when expediting certification and  issuance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order to expedite the certification process, the State agency  shall use the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In all cases, the applicant's identity (i.e., the identity of  the person making the application) shall be verified through a  collateral contact or readily available documentary evidence as  specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All reasonable efforts shall be made to verify within the  expedited processing standards, the household's residency in accordance  with Sec. 273.2(f)(1)(vi), income statement (including a statement that  the household has no income), liquid resources and all other factors  required by Sec. 273.2(f), through collateral contacts or readily  available documentary evidence. However, benefits shall not be delayed  beyond the delivery standards prescribed in paragraph (i)(3) of this  section, solely because these eligibility factors have not been  verified.  State agencies also may verify factors other than identity, residency,  and income provided that verification can be accomplished within  expedited processing standards. State agencies should attempt to obtain  as much additional verification as possible during the interview, but  should not delay the certification of households entitled to expedited  service for the full timeframes specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this  section when the State agency has determined it is unlikely that other  verification can be obtained within these timeframes. Households  entitled to expedited service will be asked to furnish a social security  number for each person applying for benefts or apply for one for each  person applying for benefits before the second full month of  participation. Those household members unable to provide the required  SSN's or who do not have one prior to the second full month of  participation shall be allowed to continue to participate only if they  satisfy the good cause requirements with respect to SSN's specified in  Sec. 273.6(d), except that households with a newborn may have up to 6  months following the month the baby was born to supply an SSN or proof  of an application for an SSN for the newborn in accordance with  Sec. 273.6(b)(4). The State agency may attempt to register other  household members but shall postpone the registration of other household  members if it cannot be accomplished within the expedited service  timeframes. With regard to the work registration requirements specified  in Sec. 273.7, the State agency shall, at a minimum, require the  applicant to register (unless exempt or unless the household has  designated an authorized representative to apply on its behalf in  accordance with Sec. 273.1(f)). The State agency may attempt  registration of other household members by requesting that the applicant  complete the work registration forms for other household members to the  best of his or her ability. The State agency may also attempt to  accomplish work registration for other household members in a timely  manner through other means, such as calling the household. The State  agency may attempt to verify questionable work registration exemptions,  but such verification shall be postponed if the expedited service  timeframes cannot be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.  Although the household has the primary responsibility for providing  other types of verification, the State agency shall assist the household  in promptly obtaining the necessary verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Households that are certified on an expedited basis and have  provided   all necessary verification required in paragraph (f) of this section  prior to certification shall be assigned normal certification periods.  If verification was postponed, the State agency may certify these  households for the month of application (the month of application and  the subsequent month for those households applying after the 15th of the  month) or, at the State agency's option, may assign normal certification  periods to those households whose circumstances would otherwise warrant  longer certification periods. State agencies, at their option, may  request any household eligible for expedited service which applies after  the 15th of the month and is certified for the month of application and  the subsequent month only to submit a second application (at the time of  the initial certification) if the household's verification is postponed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For households applying on or before the 15th of the month, the  State agency may assign a one-month certification period or assign a  normal certification period. Satisfaction of the verification  requirements may be postponed until the second month of participation.  If a one-month certification period is assigned, the notice of  eligibility may be combined with the notice of expiration or a separate  notice may be sent. The notice of eligibility must explain that the  household has to satisfy all verification requirements that were  postponed. For subsequent months, the household must reapply and satisfy  all verification requirements which were postponed or be certified under  normal processing standards. If the household does not satisfy the  postponed verification requirements and does not appear for the  interview, the State agency does not need to contact the household  again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For households applying after the 15th of the month, the State  agency may assign a 2-month certification period or a normal  certification period of no more than 12 months. Verification may be  postponed until the third month of participation, if necessary, to meet  the expedited timeframe. If a two-month certification period is  assigned, the notice of eligibility may be combined with the notice of  expiration or a separate notice may be sent. The notice of eligibility  must explain that the household is obligated to satisfy the verification  requirements that were postponed. For subsequent months, the household  must reapply and satisfy the verification requirements which were  postponed or be certified under normal processing standards. If the  household does not satisfy the postponed verification requirements and  does not attend the interview, the State agency does not need to contact  the household again. When a certification period of longer than 2 months  is assigned and verification is postponed, households must be sent a  notice of eligibility advising that no benefits for the third month will  be issued until the postponed verification requirements are satisfied.  The notice must also advise the household that if the verification  process results in changes in the household's eligibility or level of  benefits, the State agency will act on those changes without advance  notice of adverse action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Households which apply for initial benefits (as described in  Sec. 273.10(a)) after the 15th of the month, are entitled to expedited  service, have completed the application process, and have been  determined eligible to receive benefits for the initial month and the  next subsequent month, shall receive a combined allotment consisting of  prorated benefits for the initial month of application and benefits for  the first full month of participation within the expedited service  timeframe. If necessary, verification shall be postponed to meet the  expedited timeframe. The benefits shall be issued in accordance with  Sec. 274.2(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The provisions of paragraph (i)(4)(iii)(C) of this section do  not apply to households which have been determined ineligible to receive  benefits for the month of application or the following month, or to  households which have not satisfied the postponed verification  requirements. However, households eligible for expedited service may  receive benefits for the initial month and next subsequent month under  the verification standards of paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the State agency chooses to exercise the option to require a  second   application in accordance with paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section and  receives the application before the third month, it shall not deny the  application but hold it pending until the third month. The State agency  will issue the third month's benefits within 5 working days from receipt  of the necessary verification information but not before the first day  of the month. If the postponed verification requirements are not  completed before the end of the third month, the State agency shall  terminate the household's participation and shall issue no further  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is no limit to the number of times a household can be  certified under expedited procedures, as long as prior to each expedited  certification, the household either completes the verification  requirements that were postponed at the last expedited certification or  was certified under normal processing standards since the last expedited  certification. The provisions of this section shall not apply at  recertification if a household reapplies before the end of its current  certification period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Households requesting, but not entitled to, expedited service  shall have their applications processed according to normal standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(4)</em> of  this section. The State agency must base the benefit levels of all  households solely on food stamp criteria. The State agency must certify  jointly processed and categorically eligible households in accordance  with food stamp procedural, timeliness, and notice requirements,  including the 7-day expedited service provisions of paragraph (i) of  this section and normal 30-day application processing standards of  paragraph (g) of this section. Individuals authorized to receive PA,  SSI, or GA benefits but who have not yet received payment are considered  recipients of benefits from those programs. In addition, individuals are  considered recipients of PA, SSI, or GA if their PA, SSI, or GA benefits  are suspended or recouped. Individuals entitled to PA, SSI, or GA  benefits but who are not paid such benefits because the grant is less  than a minimum benefit are also considered recipients. The State agency  may not consider as recipients those individuals not receiving GA, PA,  or SSI benefits who are entitled to Medicaid only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicant PA households. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a joint PA/food stamp  application is used, the application may contain all   the information necessary to determine a household's food stamp  eligibility and level of benefits. Information relevant only to food  stamp eligibility must be contained in the PA form or must be an  attachment to it. The joint PA/food stamp application must clearly  indicate that the household is providing information for both programs,  is subject to the criminal penalties of both programs for making false  statements, and waives the notice of adverse action as specified in  paragraph (j)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency may conduct a single interview at initial  application for both public assistance and food stamp purposes. A  household's eligibility for food stamp out-of-office interview  provisions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section does not relieve the  household of any responsibility for a face-to-face interview to be  certified for PA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For households applying for both PA and food stamps, the State  agency must follow the verification procedures described in paragraphs  (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section for those factors of eligibility  which are needed solely for purposes of determining the household's  eligibility for food stamps. For those factors of eligibility which are  needed to determine both PA eligibility and food stamp eligibility, the  State agency may use the PA verification rules. However, if the  household has provided the State agency sufficient verification to meet  the verification requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of  this section, but has failed to provide sufficient verification to meet  the PA verification rules, the State agency may not use such failure as  a basis for denying the household's food stamp application or failing to  comply with processing requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.  Under these circumstances, the State agency must process the household's  food stamp application and determine eligibility based on its compliance  with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In order to determine if a household will be eligible due to  its status as a recipient PA/SSI household, the State agency may  temporarily postpone, within the 30-day processing standard, the food  stamp eligibility determination if the household is not entitled to  expedited service and appears to be categorically eligible. However, the  State agency shall postpone denying a potentially categorically eligible  household until the 30th day in case the household is determined  eligible to receive PA benefits. Once the PA application is approved,  the household is to be considered categorically eligible if it meets all  the criteria concerning categorical eligibility in Sec. 273.2(j)(2). If  the State agency can anticipate the amount and the date of receipt of  the initial PA payment, but the payment will not be received until a  subsequent month, the State agency shall vary the household's food stamp  benefit level according to the anticipated receipt of the payment and  notify the household. Portions of initial PA payments intended to  retroactively cover a previous month shall be disregarded as lump sum  payments under Sec. 273.9(c)(8). If the amount or date of receipt of the  initial PA payment cannot be reasonably anticipated at the time of the  food stamp eligibility determination, the PA payments shall be handled  as a change in circumstances. However, the State agency is not required  to send a notice of adverse action if the receipt of the PA grant  reduces, suspends or terminates the household's food stamp benefits,  provided the household is notified in advance that its benefits may be  reduced, suspended, or terminated when the grant is received. The case  may be terminated if the household is not categorically eligible in  accordance with Sec. 273.12(c). The State agency shall ensure that the  denied application of a potentially categorically eligible household is  easily retrievable. For a household filing a joint application for food  stamps and PA benefits or a household that has a PA application pending  and is denied food stamps but is later determined eligible to receive PA  benefits and is otherwise categorically eligible, the State agency shall  provide benefits using the original application and any other pertinent  information occurring subsequent to that application. Except for  residents of public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food  stamp benefits prior   to their release from a public institution in accordance with  Sec. 273.1(e)(2), benefits shall be paid from the beginning of the  period for which PA or SSI benefits are paid, the original food stamp  application date, or December 23, 1985 whichever is later. Residents of  public institutions who apply jointly for SSI and food stamp benefits  prior to their release from the institution shall be paid benefits from  the date of their release from the institution. In situations where the  State agency must update and reevaluate the original application of a  denied case, the State agency shall not reinterview the household, but  shall use any available information to update the application. The State  agency shall then contact the household by phone or mail to explain and  confirm changes made by the State agency and to determine if other  changes in household circumstances have occurred. If any information  obtained from the household differs from that which the State agency  obtained from available information or the household provided additional  changes in information, the State agency shall arrange for the household  or it authorized representative to initial all changes, re-sign and date  the updated application and provide necessary verification. In no event  can benefits be provided prior to the date of the original food stamp  application filed on or after December 23, 1985. Any household that is  determined to be eligible to receive PA benefits for a period of time  within the 30-day food stamp processing time, shall be provided food  stamp benefits back to the date of the food stamp application. However,  in no event shall food stamp benefits be paid for a month for which such  household is ineligible for receipt of any PA benefits for the month,  unless the household is eligible for food stamp benefits and an NPA  case. Benefits shall be prorated in accordance with  Sec. 273.10(a)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii)(B). Household that file joint  applications that are found categorically eligible after being denied  NPA food stamps shall have their benefits for the initial month prorated  from the date from which the PA benefits are payable, or the date of the  original food stamp application, whichever is later. The State agency  shall act on reevaluating the original application either at the  household's request or when it becomes otherwise aware of the  household's PA and/or SSI eligibility. The household shall be informed  on the notice of denial required by Sec. 273.10(g)(1)(ii) to notify the  State agency if its PA or SSI benefits are approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The State agency may not require households which file a joint  PA/food stamp application and whose PA applications are denied to file  new food stamp applications. Rather, the State agency must determine or  continue their food stamp eligibility on the basis of the original  applications filed jointly for PA and food stamp purposes.

The State agency shall restore to  the household benefits which were lost whenever the loss was caused by  an error by the State agency or by the Social Security Administration  through joint processing. Such an error shall include, but not be  limited to, the loss of an applicant's food stamp application after it  has been filed with SSA or with a State agency's outstationed worker.  Lost benefits shall be restored in accordance with Sec. 273.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recertification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall complete the  application process and approve or deny timely applications for  recertification in accordance with Sec. 273.14 of the food stamp  regulations. A face-to-face interview shall be waived if requested by a  household consisting entirely of SSI participants unable to appoint an  authorized representative. The State agency shall provide SSI households  with a notice of expiration in accordance with Sec. 273.14(b), except  that such notification shall inform households consisting entirely of  SSI recipients that they are entitled to a waiver of a face-to-face  interview if the household is unable to appoint an authorized  representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Households shall be entitled to make a timely application (in  accordance with Sec. 273.14(b)(3)) for food stamp recertification at an  SSA office under the following conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In SSA offices where Sec. 273.2(k)(1)(i) is in effect, SSA shall  accept the application of a pure SSI household and forward the completed  application, transmittal form and any available verification to the  designated food stamp office. Where SSA accepts and refers the  application in such situations, the household shall not be required to  appear at a second office interview, although the State agency may  conduct an out-of-office interview, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In SSA offices where Sec. 273.2(k)(1)(ii) is in effect, the  outstationed worker shall accept the application and interview the  recipient and the State agency shall process the application according  to Sec. 273.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Households applying for or receiving social security benefits.  An applicant for or recipient of social security benefits under title II  of the Social Security Act shall be informed at the SSA office of the  availability of benefits under the Food Stamp Program and the  availability of a Food Stamp Program application at the SSA office. The  SSA office is not required to accept applications and conduct interviews  for title II applicants/recipients in the manner prescribed in  Sec. 273.2(k) for SSI applicants/recipients unless the State agency has  chosen to outstation eligibility   workers at the SSA office and has an agreement with SSA to allow the  processing of such households at SSA offices. In these cases, processing  shall be in accordance with Sec. 273.2(k)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Households where not all members are applying for or receiving  SSI. An applicant for or recipient of SSI shall be informed at the SSA  office of the availability of benefits under the Food Stamp Program and  the availability of a food stamp application at the SSA office. The SSA  office is not required to accept applications or to conduct interviews  for SSI applicants or recipients who are not members of households in  which all are SSI applicants or recipients unless the State agency has  chosen to outstation eligibility workers at the SSA office. In this  case, processing shall be in accordance with Sec. 273.2(k)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Authorized representatives. Representatives may be authorized to  act on behalf of a household in the application process, in obtaining  food stamp benefits, and in using food stamp benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application processing and reporting. The State agency shall  inform applicants and prospective applicants that indicate that they may  have difficulty completing the application process, that a nonhousehold  member may be designated as the authorized representative for  application processing purposes. The household member or the authorized  representative may complete work registration forms for those household  members required to register for work. The authorized representative  designated for application processing purposes may also carry out  household responsibilities during the certification period, such as  reporting changes in the household's income or other household  circumstances in accordance with Sec. Sec. 273.12(a) and 273.21. Except  for those situations in which a drug and alcohol treatment center or  other group living arrangement acts as the authorized representative,  the State agency must inform the household that the household will be  held liable for any overissuance that results from erroneous information  given by the authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A nonhousehold member may be designated as an authorized  representative for the application process provided that the person is  an adult who is sufficiently aware of relevant household circumstances  and the authorized representative designation has been made in writing  by the head of the household, the spouse, or another responsible member  of the household. Paragraph (n)(4) of this section contains further  restrictions on who can be designated an authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers must apply and  be certified through the use of authorized representatives in accordance  with Sec. 273.11(e). Residents of group living arrangements have the  option to apply and be certified through the use of authorized  representatives in accordance with Sec. 273.11(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Obtaining food stamp benefits. An authorized representative may  be designated to obtain benefits. Even if the household is able to  obtain benefits, it should be encouraged to name an authorized  representative for obtaining benefits in case of illness or other  circumstances which might result in an inability to obtain benefits. The  name of the authorized representative must be recorded in the  household's case record and on the food stamp identification (ID) card,  as provided in Sec. 274.10(a)(1) of this chapter. The authorized  representative for obtaining benefits may or may not be the same  individual designated as an authorized representative for the  application process or for meeting reporting requirements during the  certification period. The State agency must develop a system by which a  household may designate an emergency authorized representative in  accordance with Sec. 274.10(c) of this chapter to obtain the household's  benefits for a particular month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Using benefits. A household may allow any household member or  nonmember to use its ID card and benefits to purchase food or meals, if  authorized, for the household. Drug or alcohol treatment centers and  group living arrangements which act as authorized representatives for  residents of the facilities must use food stamp benefits   for food prepared and served to those residents participating in the  Food Stamp Program (except when residents leave the facility as provided  in Sec. 273.11(e) and (f)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Restrictions on designations of authorized representatives. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  The State agency must restrict the use of authorized representatives for  purposes of application processing and obtaining food stamp benefits as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> State agency employees who are involved in the certification or  issuance processes and retailers who are authorized to accept food stamp  benefits may not act as authorized representatives without the specific  written approval of a designated State agency official and only if that  official determines that no one else is available to serve as an  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An individual disqualified for an intentional Program violation  cannot act as an authorized representative during the disqualification  period, unless the State agency has determined that no one else is  available to serve as an authorized representative. The State agency  must separately determine whether the individual is needed to apply on  behalf of the household, or to obtain benefits on behalf of the  household.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a State agency has determined that an authorized  representative has knowingly provided false information about household  circumstances or has made improper use of coupons, it may disqualify  that person from being an authorized representative for up to one year.  The State agency must send written notification to the affected  household(s) and the authorized representative 30 days prior to the date  of disqualification. The notification must specify the reason for the  proposed action and the household's right to request a fair hearing.  This provision is not applicable in the case of drug and alcoholic  treatment centers and those group homes which act as authorized  representatives for their residents. However, drug and alcohol treatment  centers and the heads of group living arrangements that act as  authorized representatives for their residents, and which intentionally  misrepresent households circumstances, may be prosecuted under  applicable Federal and State statutes for their acts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Homeless meal providers, as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this  chapter, may not act as authorized representatives for homeless food  stamp recipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In order to prevent abuse of the program, the State agency may  set a limit on the number of households an authorized representative may  represent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event employers, such as those that employ migrant or  seasonal farmworkers, are designated as authorized representatives or  that a single authorized representative has access to a large number of  authorization documents or coupons, the State agency should exercise  caution to assure that each household has freely requested the  assistance of the authorized representative, the household's  circumstances are correctly represented, the household is receiving the  correct amount of benefits and that the authorized representative is  properly using the benefits.
