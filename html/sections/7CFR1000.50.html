                            <p class="depth0">Class prices per hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat, component prices, and advanced pricing factors shall be as follows. The prices and pricing factors described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (q) of this section shall be based on a weighted average of the most recent 2 weekly prices announced by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) before the 24th day of the

month. These prices shall be announced on or before the 23rd day of the month and shall apply to milk received during the following month. The prices described in paragraphs (g) through (p) of this section shall be based on a weighted average for the preceding month of weekly prices announced by NASS on or before the 5th day of the month and shall apply to milk received during the preceding month. The price described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be derived from the Class II skim milk price announced on or before the 23rd day of the month preceding the month to which it applies and the butterfat price announced on or before the 5th day of the month following the month to which it applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class I price. The Class I price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be 0.965 times the Class I skim milk price plus 3.5 times the Class I butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class I skim milk price. The Class I skim milk price per hundredweight shall be the adjusted Class I differential specified in Sec. 1000.52, plus the adjustment to Class I prices specified in Sec. Sec. 1005.51(b), 1006.51(b) and 1007.51(b), plus the higher of the advanced pricing factors computed in paragraph (q)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class I butterfat price. The Class I butterfat price per pound shall be the adjusted Class I differential specified in Sec. 1000.52 divided by 100, plus the adjustments to Class I prices specified in Sec. Sec. 1005.51(b), 1006.51(b) and 1007.51(b) divided by 100, plus the advanced butterfat price computed in paragraph (q)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Class II price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be .965 times the Class II skim milk price plus 3.5 times the Class II butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Class II skim milk price. The Class II skim milk price per hundredweight shall be the advanced Class IV skim milk price computed in paragraph (q)(2) of this section plus 70 cents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Class II nonfat solids price. The Class II nonfat solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class II skim milk price divided by 9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Class II butterfat price. The Class II butterfat price per pound shall be the butterfat price plus $0.007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Class III price. The Class III price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be 0.965 times the Class III skim milk price plus 3.5 times the butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Class III skim milk price. The Class III skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the protein price per pound times 3.1 plus the other solids price per pound times 5.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Class IV price. The Class IV price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be 0.965 times the Class IV skim milk price plus 3.5 times the butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Class IV skim milk price. The Class IV skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the nonfat solids price per pound times 9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS AA Butter survey price reported by the Department for the month, less 17.15 cents, with the result multiplied by 1.211.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Nonfat solids price. The nonfat solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS nonfat dry milk survey price reported by the Department for the month, less 16.78 cents and multiplying the result by 0.99.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compute a weighted average of the amounts described in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The U.S. average NASS survey price for 40-lb. block cheese reported by the Department for the month; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The U.S. average NASS survey price for 500-pound barrel cheddar cheese (38 percent moisture) reported by the Department for the month plus 3 cents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subtract 20.03 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section and multiply the result by 1.383;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add to the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(2) of this section an amount computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subtract 20.03 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section and multiply the result by 1.572; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subtract 0.9 times the butterfat price computed pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section from the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiply the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section by 1.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Other solids price.
