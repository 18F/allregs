                            <p class="depth0">The Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement Provisions for the 2008 and succeeding crop years are as follows:
FCIC policies</p><p class="depth0">United States Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</p><p class="depth0">Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Percentage factor. The historical average percentage of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better, by type, determined from your records. If at least 4 continuous years of records are available, the percentage factor will be the simple average of the available records not to exceed 10 years. If less than 4 years of records are available, the percentage factor will be determined based on a combination of your records and the percentage factor contained in the Special Provisions so that such a combination would be

the functional equivalent of 4 years of records.</p><p class="depth0">2. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.</p><p class="depth0">3. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0">4. All acreage of potatoes insured under the Northern Potato Crop Provisions will be insured under this endorsement except:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any acreage specifically excluded by the actuarial documents; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any acreage grown for seed.</p><p class="depth0">5. We will adjust the production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions for potatoes that do not meet U.S. No. 2 grade requirements from unharvested acreage or harvested acreage that is stored or is marketed after a grade inspection due to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Internal defects as long as the number of potatoes with such defects are in excess of the tolerances allowed for the U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes on a lot basis and are not separable from undamaged production using methods used by the packers or processors to whom you normally deliver your potato production as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, or the production is delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by (adjustment under section 5(a)(1) or 5(a)(2)(i) will not be performed if it already has been performed under the terms of section 11(g) of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dividing the price received or that will be received per hundredweight by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a price is not agreed upon between you and a buyer and the production is not delivered within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, and the potatoes remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or more days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be the greater of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of production determined by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Dividing the price per hundredweight that is received, or will be received after the end of the applicable insurance period, by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Multiplying the result of section 5(a)(2)(i)(A) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of production determined as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The combined weight of sampled potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better (the amount of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 will be based on a grade inspection completed no later than 21 days after the end of the insurance period (if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and a grade inspection completed within 21 days of sampling) and are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by the total sample weight;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The percentage determined in section 5(a)(2)(ii)(A) will be divided by the applicable percentage factor; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The result of section 5(a)(2)(ii)(B) will be multiplied by the amount of production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Factors other than those specified in section 5(a), in accordance with section 5(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. For any production that qualifies for adjustment in accordance with section 5(a) and that is discarded:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Zero if we determine the production could not have been sold; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determined in accordance with section 5(a)(2)(ii) if we determine the production could have been sold; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Later than 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be adjusted in accordance with section 5(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">7. Potatoes harvested or appraised prior to full maturity that do not grade U.S. No. 2 due solely to size will be considered to have met U.S. No. 2 standards unless the potatoes are damaged by an insurable cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would either reduce production or decrease quality.</p><p class="depth0">8. Production to count for potatoes destroyed, stored or marketed without a grade inspection will be 100 percent of the gross weight of such potatoes.</p><p class="depth0">9. All determinations must be based upon a grade inspection.</p><p class="depth0">10. The actuarial documents may provide ``U.S. No. 1 grade'' in place of ``U.S. No. 2 grade'' as used in this endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If both U.S. No.1 and U.S. No. 2 grades are available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 grade by potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If both fresh and processing types are specified in the actuarial documents, you cannot elect the fresh type for any potatoes grown for processing or chipping.
