However, when there are compelling reasons to grant access to classified  information to an immigrant alien or a foreign national in furtherance  of the mission of the Department of Defense, such individuals may be  granted a ``Limited Access Authorization'' (LAA) under the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> LAAs will be limited to Secret and Confidential level only; LAAs  for Top Secret are prohibited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Access to classified information is not inconsistent with that  determined releasable by designated disclosure authorities, in  accordance with DoD Directive 5230.11 \1\ to the country of which the  individual is a citizen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Access to classified information must be limited to  information relating to a specific program or project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Favorable completion of an BI (scoped for 10 years); where the  full investigative coverage cannot be completed, a counterintelligence  scope polygraph examination will be required in accordance with the  provisions of DoD Directive 5210.48.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Security clearances previously issued to immigrant aliens will  be reissued as LAAs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Limited Access Authorization determination shall be made  only by an authority designated in paragraph B, Appendix E.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> LAAs issued by the Unified and Specified Commands shall be  reported to the central adjudicative facility of the appropriate  military department in accordance with the assigned responsibilities in  DoD Directive 5100.3 \1\ for inclusion in the Defense Central Index of  Investigation (DCII).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In each case of granting a Limited Access Authorization, a  record shall be maintained as to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity (including current citizenship) of the individual  to whom the Limited Access Authorization is granted, to include name and  date and place of birth;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Date and type of most recent investigation to include the  identity of the investigating agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nature of the specific program material(s) to which access  is authorized (delineated as precisely as possible);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The classification level to which access is authorized; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The compelling reasons for granting access to the materials  cited in (iii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Status of the individual (i.e., immigrant alien or foreign  national).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individuals granted LAAs under the foregoing provisions shall be  the subject of a 5-year periodic reinvestigation as set forth in  paragraph 5, Appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foreign nationals who are LAA candidates must agree to submit to  a counterintelligence-scope polygraph examination prior to being granted  access in accordance with DoD Directive 5210.48.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If geographical and political situations prevent the full  completion of the BI (and/or counterintelligence-scope polygraph)  issuance of an LAA shall not be authorized; exceptions to the policy may  only be authorized by the DUSD(P).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A report on all LAAs in effect, including the data required in  paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section shall be furnished to  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy within 60 days after  the end of each fiscal year. (See Sec. 154.77).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access by persons outside the Executive Branch. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Access to  classified information by persons outside the Executive Branch shall be  accomplished in accordance with 32 CFR part 159. The investigative  requirement shall be the same as for the appropriate level of security  clearance, except as indicated below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives do not  require personnel security clearances. They may be granted access to DoD  classified information which relates to matters under the jurisdiction  of the respective Committees to which they are assigned and is needed to  perform their duties in connection with such assignments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Congressional staff members requiring access to DoD classified  information shall be processed for a security clearance in accordance  with 32 CFR part 353 and the provisions of this part. The Director,  Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) will initiate the required  investigation (initial or reinvestigation) to DIS, adjudicate the  results and grant, deny or revoke the security clearance, as  appropriate. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs)  will be notified by WHS of the completed clearance action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State governors do not require personnel security clearances.  They may be granted access to specifically designated classified  information, on a ``need-to-know'' basis, based upon affirmation by the  Secretary of Defense or the head of a DoD Component or single designee,  that access, under the circumstances, serves the national interest.  Staff personnel of a governor's office requiring access to classified  information shall be investigated and cleared in accordance with the  prescribed procedures of this part when the head of a DoD Component, or  single designee, affirms that such clearance serves the national  interest. Access shall also be limited to specifically designated  classified information on a ``need-to-know'' basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Federal judiciary and the  Supreme Courts of the individual States do not require personnel  security clearances. They may be granted access to DoD classified  information to the extent necessary to adjudicate cases being heard  before these individual courts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Attorneys representing DoD military, civilian or contractor  personnel, requiring access to DoD classified information to properly  represent their clients, shall normally be investigated by DIS and  cleared in accordance with the prescribed procedures in paragraph (b) of  this section. This shall be done upon certification of the General  Counsel of the DoD Component involved in the litigation that access to  specified classified information, on the part of the attorney concerned,  is necessary to adequately represent his or her client. In exceptional  instances, when the exigencies of a given situation do not permit timely  compliance with the provisions of Sec. 154.16(b), access may be granted  with the written approval of an authority designated in Appendix E  provided that as a minimum: a favorable name check of the FBI and the  DCII has been completed, and a DoD Non-   Disclosure Agreement has been executed. In post-indictment cases, after  a judge has invoked the security procedures of the Classified  Information Procedures Act (CIPA) the Department of Justice may elect to  conduct the necessary background investigation and issue the required  security clearance, in coordination with the affected DoD Component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions on issuance of personnel security clearances.  Personnel security clearances must be kept to the absolute minimum  necessary to meet mission requirements. Personnel security clearances  shall not be issued:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To persons in nonsensitive positions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To persons whose regular duties do not require authorized access  to classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For ease of movement of persons within a restricted, controlled,  or industrial area, whose duties do not require access to classified  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To persons who may only have inadvertent access to sensitive  information or areas, such as guards, emergency service personnel,  firemen, doctors, nurses, police, ambulance drivers, or similar  personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To persons working in shipyards whose duties do not require  access to classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To persons who can be prevented from accessing classified  information by being escorted by cleared personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To food service personnel, vendors and similar commercial sales  or service personnel whose duties do not require access to classified  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To maintenance or cleaning personnel who may only have  inadvertent access to classified information unless such access cannot  be reasonably prevented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To persons who perform maintenance on office equipment,  computers, typewriters, and similar equipment who can be denied  classified access by physical security measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> To perimeter security personnel who have no access to  classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> To drivers, chauffeurs and food service personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Dual citizenship. Persons claiming both U.S. and foreign  citizenship shall be processed under Sec. 154.16(b) and adjudicated in  accordance with the ``Foreign Preference'' standard in Appendix I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> One-time access. Circumstances may arise where an urgent  operational or contractual exigency exists for cleared DoD personnel to  have one-time or short duration access to classified information at a  higher level than is authorized by the existing security clearance. In  many instances, the processing time required to upgrade the clearance  would preclude timely access to the information. In such situations, and  only for compelling reasons in furtherance of the DoD mission, an  authority referred to in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, may grant  higher level access on a temporary basis subject to the terms and  conditions prescribed below. This special authority may be revoked for  abuse, inadequate record keeping, or inadequate security oversight.  These procedures do not apply when circumstances exist which would  permit the routine processing of an individual for the higher level  clearance. Procedures and conditions for effecting emergency one-time  access to the next higher classification level are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorization for such one-time access shall be granted by a  flag or general officer, a general court-martial convening authority or  equivalent Senior Executive Service member, after coordination with  appropriate security officials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient of the one-time access authorization must be a  U.S. citizen, possess a current DoD security clearance, and the access  required shall be limited to classified information one level higher  than the current clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such access, once granted, shall be cancelled promptly when no  longer required, at the conclusion of the authorized period of access,  or upon notification from the granting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employee to be afforded the higher level access shall have  been continuously employed by a DoD Component or a cleared DoD  contractor for the preceding 24-month period. Higher level access is not  authorized for part-time employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pertinent local records concerning the employee concerned shall  be reviewed with favorable results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whenever possible, access shall be confined to a single instance  or at most, a few occasions. The approval for access shall automatically  expire 30 calendar days from date access commenced. If the need for  access is expected to continue for a period in excess of 30 days,  written approval of the granting authority is required. At such time as  it is determined that the need for access is expected to extend beyond  90 days, the individual concerned shall be promptly processed for the  level of clearance required. When extended access has been approved,  such access shall be cancelled at or before 90 days from original date  of access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Access at the higher level shall be limited to information under  the control and custody of the authorizing official and shall be  afforded under the general supervision of a properly cleared employee.  The employee charged with providing such supervision shall be  responsible for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recording the higher-level information actually revealed,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date(s) such access is afforded; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The daily retrieval of the material accessed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Access at the next higher level shall not be authorized for  COMSEC, SCI, NATO, or foreign government information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The exercise of this provision shall be used sparingly and  repeat use within any 12 month period on behalf of the same individual  is prohibited. The approving authority shall maintain a record  containing the following data with respect to each such access approved:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, and SSN of the employee afforded higher level access.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The level of access authorized.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Justification for the access, to include an explanation of the  compelling reason to grant the higher level access and specifically how  the DoD mission would be furthered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An unclassified description of the specific information to  which access was authorized and the duration of access along with the  date(s) access was afforded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A listing of the local records reviewed and a statement that no  significant adverse information concerning the employee is known to  exist.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The approving authority's signature certifying (h)(9) (i)  through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Copies of any pertinent briefing/debriefings administered to  the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Access by retired flag/general officers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon determination  by an active duty flag/general officer that there are compelling  reasons, in furtherance of the Department of Defense mission, to grant a  retired flag/general officer access to classified information in  connection with a specific DoD program or mission, for a period not  greater than 90 days, the investigative requirements of this part may be  waived. The access shall be limited to classified information at a level  commensurate with the security clearance held at the time of  retirement--not including access to SCI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The flag/general officer approving issuance of the clearance  shall, provide the appropriate DoD Component central clearance facility  a written record to be incorporated into the DCII detailing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full identifying data pertaining to the cleared subject;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The classification of the information to which access was  authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such access may be granted only after the compelling reason and  the specific aspect of the DoD mission which is served by granting such  access has been detailed and under the condition that the classified  materials involved are not removed from the confines of a government  installation or other area approved for storage of DoD classified  information.
