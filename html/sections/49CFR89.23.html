                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DOT shall charge interest on an outstanding debt at the Treasury  Current Value of Funds Rate published by the Secretary of the Treasury  in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR 102.13(c), unless DOT  determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of  the United States. DOT shall charge a late payment penalty at a rate of  six percent a year on any portion of a debt that is more than 90 days  past due. DOT shall also assess administrative charges to cover  additional cost incurred in processing and handling the debt beyond the  payment due date. The imposition of interest, collection charges, and  late payment penalty charges shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C.  3717, 4 CFR 102.13 (see Sec. 89.3(c) regarding payment of such charges  by Federal, state and local government agencies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest on debt shall begin to accrue on the date on which the  debtor is mailed or delivered notice of the debt and the interest  requirements or, in the case of advance billings, on the calendar day  following the specified due date of the debt, provided the advance  billing gives notice of the interest requirements for late payment.  Interest on the debt shall continue to accrue until payment is received.  Interest shall be calculated only on the principal of the debt (simple  interest). The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate in effect on  the date from which interest begins to accrue, and will remain fixed for  the duration of the indebtedness. The rate of interest assessed will  generally be the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department shall waive interest on debt that is paid within  30 calendar days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collection charges on debt shall be computed to cover the cost  of processing and handling the delinquent debt. It shall be either the  actual cost to process the particular delinquent debt to which it is  applied, or operating elements may set the amount of such monthly charge  by cost analysis establishing the average of actual additional costs  incurred by the operating element in processing similar debts.  Collection charges may also include the expense of obtaining credit  reports and of using a professional debt collection contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DOT may waive interest, collection charges, or late payment  penalty charges if it finds that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor would be eligible for compromise under standards set  forth   in 4 CFR 103.2 with regard to the amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Collection of interest, administrative charges, or penalties  will jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is otherwise in the best interests of the United States,  including the situation in which an offset or installment payment  agreement is in effect.</p>
