                                Sec. 780.12  Work exempt under another section of the Act.

                            <p class="depth0">The combination (tacking) of exempt work under one exemption with  exempt   work under another exemption is permitted. For instance, the overtime  pay requirements are not considered applicable to an employee who does  work within section 13(b)(12) for only part of a workweek if all of the  covered work done by him during the remainder of the workweek is within  one or more equivalent exemptions under other provisions of the Act. If  the scope of such exemptions is not the same, however, the exemption  applicable to the employee is equivalent to that provided by whichever  exemption provision is more limited in scope. For instance, an employee  who devotes part of a workweek to work within section 13(b)(12) and the  remainder to work exempt under section 7(c) must receive the minimum  wage and must be paid time and one-half for his overtime work during  that week for hours over 10 a day or 50 a week, whichever provides the  greater compensation. Each activity is tested separately under the  applicable exemption as though it were the sole activity of the employee  for the whole workweek in question. The availability of a combination  exemption depends on whether the employee meets all the requirements of  each exemption which is sought to combine.</p>
