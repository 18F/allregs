                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discretionary referrals. The Copyright Royalty Judges may seek  guidance from the Register of Copyrights with respect to a material  question of substantive law, concerning an interpretation or  construction of those provisions of the Copyright Act, that arises in  the course of their proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How presented. A question of substantive law may be referred to  the Register of Copyrights at the request of one or more of the  Copyright Royalty Judges. A question of substantive   law may also be referred to the Register of Copyrights as a request  submitted by motion of a participant, provided that one or more of the  Copyright Royalty Judges agrees with the participant's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referral by Judges. One or more of the Copyright Royalty Judges  may refer what he or she believes to be a material question of  substantive law to the Register of Copyrights at any time during a  proceeding by issuing a written referral that is made part of the record  of that proceeding. The referral will state the issue(s) to be referred  and the schedule for the filing of briefs by the parties of the  issue(s). After the briefs and other relevant materials are received,  they will be transmitted to the Register of Copyrights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Motion by participant. Any participant may submit a motion to  the Copyright Royalty Judges (but not to the Register of Copyrights)  requesting their referral to the Register of Copyrights a question that  the participant believes would be suitable for referral under paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Content. The motion should be captioned ``Motion of  [Participant(s)] Requesting Referral of Material Question of Substantive  Law.'' The motion should set forth, at the outset, the precise legal  question for which the moving party is seeking interlocutory referral to  the Register of Copyrights. The motion should then proceed to explain,  with brevity, why the issue meets the criteria for potential referral  under paragraph (a) of this section and why the interests of fair and  efficient adjudication would be best served by obtaining interlocutory  guidance from the Register of Copyrights. The motion should not include  argument on the merits of the issue, but may include a suggested  schedule of briefing that would make reasonable provision for comments  and legal arguments, in such a way as to avoid delay and duplication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time of motion. A motion for referral of a material question of  substantive law to the Register of Copyrights should be filed as soon as  possible in the relevant proceeding, but no later than any deadline set  by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Action on motion--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Referral granted. Upon consideration of  a Motion Requesting Referral of Material Question of Substantive Law, if  one or more of the Copyright Royalty Judges agrees with the request, the  Chief Judge shall issue an appropriate referral. The referral will state  the issue(s) to be referred and the schedule for the filing of briefs by  the parties of the issue(s). After the briefs and other relevant  materials are received, they will be transmitted to the Register of  Copyrights.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Referral denied. If none of the Copyright Royalty Judges agrees  with the request, the Board will issue an order denying the request  which will provide the basis for the decision. A copy of any order  denying a Motion Requesting Referral of Material Question of Substantive  Law will be transmitted to the Register of Copyrights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No effect on proceedings. The issuance of a request to the  Register of Copyrights for an interpretive ruling under this part does  not delay or otherwise affect the schedule of the participants'  obligations in the relevant ongoing proceeding, unless that schedule or  those obligations are expressly changed by order of the Copyright  Royalty Judges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Binding effect; time limit. The Copyright Royalty Judges will  not issue a final determination in a proceeding where the discretionary  referral of a question to the Register of Copyrights under this part is  pending, unless the Register has not delivered the decision to the  Copyright Royalty Judges within 14 days after the Register receives all  of the briefs of the participants. If the decision of the Register of  Copyrights is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges, the  decision will be included in the record of the proceeding. The legal  interpretation embodied in the timely delivered response of the Register  of Copyrights in resolving material questions of substantive law is  binding upon the Copyright Royalty Judges and will be applied by them in  their final determination in the relevant proceeding.
