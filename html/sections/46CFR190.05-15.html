                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a compartment containing the emergency source of electric power, or vital components thereof, adjoins a space containing either the ship's service generators or machinery necessary for the operation of the ship's service generators, all common bulkheads and/or decks shall be protected by approved ``structural insulation'' or other approved material. This protection shall be such as to be capable of preventing an excessive temperature rise in the space containing the emergency source of electric power, or vital components thereof, for a period of at least 1 hour in the event of fire in the adjoining space. Bulkheads or decks meeting Class A-60 requirements, as defined by Sec. 72.05-10 of Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) of this chapter, will be considered as meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
