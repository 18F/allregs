                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary concerned may transfer real property and personal  property to the LRA for purposes of job generation on the former  installation. Such a transfer is an Economic Development Conveyance  (EDC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An LRA is the only entity eligible to receive property under an  EDC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary concerned shall use the completed application,  along with other relevant information, to decide whether to enter into  an EDC with an LRA. An LRA may submit an EDC application only after it  adopts a redevelopment plan. The Secretary concerned shall establish a  reasonable time period for submission of an EDC application after  consultation with the LRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The application shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the adopted redevelopment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A project narrative including the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A general description of the property requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the intended uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the economic impact of closure or realignment  on the local community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the economic condition of the community and  the prospects for redevelopment of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement of how the EDC is consistent with the overall  redevelopment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of how the EDC will contribute to short- and long- term job generation on the installation, including the projected number  and type of new jobs it will assist in generating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A business/operational plan for development of the EDC parcel,  including at least the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A development timetable, phasing schedule, and cash flow  analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A market and financial feasibility analysis describing the  economic viability of the project, including an estimate of net proceeds  over the planned life of the redevelopment project, but in no event for  less than fifteen years after the initial transfer of property, and the  proposed consideration or payment to the Department of Defense. The  proposed consideration should describe the methodology for payment and  include draft documents or instruments proposed to secure such payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A cost estimate and justification for infrastructure and other  investments needed for redevelopment of the EDC parcel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A proposed local investment and financing plan for the  development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A statement describing why an EDC will more effectively enable  achievement of the job generation objectives of the redevelopment plan  regarding the parcel requested for conveyance than other federal real  property disposal authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Evidence of the LRA's legal authority to acquire and dispose of  the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Evidence that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The LRA has authority to perform the actions required of it,  pursuant to the terms of the EDC, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the officers submitting the application and making the  representations contained therein on behalf of the LRA have the  authority to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A commitment from the LRA that the proceeds from any sale or  lease of the EDC parcel (or any portion thereof) received by the LRA  during at least the first seven years after the date of the initial  transfer of property, except   proceeds that are used to pay consideration to the Secretary concerned  under paragraph (h) of this section, shall be used to support economic  redevelopment of, or related to, the installation. In the case of phased  transfers, the Secretary concerned shall require that this commitment  apply during at least the first seven years after the date of the last  transfer of property to the LRA. For the purposes of calculating this  reinvestment period, a lease in furtherance of conveyance shall  constitute a transfer. The use of proceeds to pay for, or offset the  costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any of  the following purposes shall be considered a use to support the economic  redevelopment of, or related to, the installation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Road construction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transportation management facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Storm and sanitary sewer construction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Police and fire protection facilities and other public  facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Utility construction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Building rehabilitation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Historic property preservation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Pollution prevention equipment or facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vix)</em> Demolition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous waste generated by  demolition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Landscaping, grading, and other site or public improvements;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Planning for or the marketing of the development and reuse of  the installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A commitment from the LRA to execute the agreement for transfer  of the property and accept control of the property within a reasonable  time, as determined by the Secretary concerned after consultation with  the LRA, after the date of the property disposal record of decision. The  determination of reasonable time should take account of the ability of  the Secretary concerned to provide the deed covenants, or covenant  deferral, provided for under section 120(h)(3) and (4) of the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of  1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3) and (4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary concerned shall review the application and, to the  extent practicable, provide a preliminary determination within 30 days  of receipt as to whether the Military Department can accept the  application for negotiation of terms and conditions, subject to the  following findings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The LRA submitting the application has been duly recognized by  the DoD Office of Economic Adjustment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The application is complete. With respect to the elements of the  application specified in paragraph (d)(6) and (d)(7)(i) of this section,  the Secretary concerned may accept the application for negotiation of  terms and conditions without this element, provided the Secretary  concerned is satisfied that the LRA has a reasonable plan in place to  provide the element prior to transfer of the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The proposed EDC will more effectively enable achievement of the  job generation objectives of the redevelopment plan regarding the parcel  requested than the application of other federal real property disposal  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Upon acceptance of an EDC application, the Secretary concerned  shall determine if the proposed terms and conditions are fair and  reasonable. The Secretary concerned may propose and negotiate any  alternative terms or conditions that the Secretary considers necessary.  The following factors shall be considered, as appropriate, in evaluating  the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including price, time  of payment, and other relevant methods of compensation to the Federal  government:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Local economic conditions and adverse impact of closure or  realignment on the region and potential for economic recovery through an  EDC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extent of short- and long-term job generation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consistency with the entire redevelopment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Financial feasibility of the development and proposed  consideration, including financial and market analysis and the need and  extent of proposed infrastructure and other investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Extent of state and local investment, level of risk incurred,  and the LRA's ability to implement the redevelopment plan. Higher risk  assumed and investment made by the LRA   should be recognized with more favorable terms and conditions, to  encourage local investment to support job generation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Current local and regional real estate market conditions,  including market demand for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Incorporation of other Federal agency interests and concerns,  including the applicability of other Federal surplus property disposal  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Economic benefit to the Federal Government, including protection  and maintenance cost savings, environmental clean-up savings, and  anticipated consideration from the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Compliance with applicable Federal, state, interstate, and local  laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Secretary concerned shall negotiate the terms and conditions  of each transaction with the LRA. The Secretary concerned shall have the  discretion and flexibility to enter into agreements that specify the  form of payment and the schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary concerned may accept, as consideration, any  combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cash, including a share of the revenues that the local  redevelopment authority receives from third-party buyers or lessees from  sales and leases of the conveyed property (i.e., a share of the revenues  generated from the redevelopment project);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Goods and services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Real property and improvements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Such other consideration as the Secretary considers  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consideration may be accepted over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All cash consideration for property at a military installation  where the date of approval of closure or realignment is before January  1, 2005, shall be deposited in the account established under Section  2906(a) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A  of title XXIX of Pub. L. 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note). All cash  consideration for property at a military installation where the date of  approval of closure or realignment is after January 1, 2005, shall be  deposited in the account established under Section 2906A(a) of the  Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX  of Pub. L. 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary concerned may use in-kind consideration received  from an LRA at any location under control of the Secretary concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The LRA and the Secretary concerned may agree on a schedule for  sale of parcels and payment participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Additional provisions shall be incorporated in the conveyance  documents to protect the Department's interest in obtaining the agreed  upon consideration, which may include such items as predetermined  release prices, accounting standards, or other appropriate clauses  designed to ensure payment and protect against fraudulent transactions.  Every agreement for an EDC shall contain provisions allowing the  Secretary concerned to recoup from the LRA such portion of the proceeds  from a sale or lease by the LRA as the Secretary concerned determines  appropriate if the LRA does not use the proceeds to support economic  redevelopment of or related to the installation during the period  specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. The Secretary concerned  and an LRA may enter into a mutually agreed participation agreement  which may include input by the Secretary concerned on the LRA's disposal  of EDC parcels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The Secretary concerned should take account of property value  but is not required to formally determine the estimated fair market  value of the property for any EDC. The consideration negotiated should  be based on a business plan and development pro-forma that assumes the  uses in the redevelopment plan. The Secretary concerned may determine  the nature and extent of any additional information needed for purposes  of an informed negotiation. This may include, but is not limited to, an  economic and market analysis, construction estimates, a real estate pro  forrma analysis, or an appraisal. To the extent not prohibited by law,  information used should be shared with the LRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> After evaluating the application based upon the criteria  specified in   paragraph (f) of this section, and negotiating terms and conditions, the  Secretary concerned shall present the proposed EDC to the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) for formal  coordination before announcing approval of the application.
