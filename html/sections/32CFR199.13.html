                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General provisions--(1) Purpose. This section prescribes guidelines and

policies for the delivery and administration of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) of the Uniformed Services of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps. The TDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage plan that is available to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven (7) Uniformed Services and their voluntary decision to accept enrollment in the plan and cost share (when applicable) with the Government in the premium cost of the benefits. The TDP is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076a, TRICARE dental program, and this section was previously titled the ``Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan''. The TDP incorporates the former 10 U.S.C. 1076b, Selected Reserve dental insurance, and the section previously titled the ``TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program'', Sec. 199.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. This section prescribes guidelines and

policies for the delivery and administration of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) of the Uniformed Services of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps. The TDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage plan that is available to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven (7) Uniformed Services and their voluntary decision to accept enrollment in the plan and cost share (when applicable) with the Government in the premium cost of the benefits.

The TDP incorporates the former 10 U.S.C. 1076b, Selected Reserve dental insurance, and the section previously titled the ``TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program'', Sec. 199.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability--(i) Geographic scope. (A) The TDP is applicable geographically within the fifty (50) States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``CONUS (or Continental United States) service area''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Geographic scope. (A) The TDP is applicable geographically within the fifty (50) States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``CONUS (or Continental United States) service area''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The TDP is applicable geographically within the fifty (50) States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``CONUS (or Continental United States) service area''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Extension of the TDP to areas outside the CONUS service area. In accordance with the authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 1076a(h), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) may extend the TDP to areas other than those areas specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the eligible members and eligible dependents of members of the Uniformed Services. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``OCONUS (or outside the Continental United States) service area''. In extending the TDP outside the CONUS service area, the ASD(HA), or designee, is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration and payment rates and procedures to providers that are different from those in effect for the CONUS service area to the extent the ASD(HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the TDP. This includes provisions for preauthorization of care if the needed services are not available in a Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and payment by the Department of certain cost-shares (or co-payments) and other portions of a provider's billed charges for certain beneficiary categories. Other differences may occur based on limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. These differences include varying licensure and certification requirements of OCONUS providers, Uniformed Service provider selection criteria and local results of provider selection, referral, beneficiary pre-authorization and marketing procedures, and care for beneficiaries residing in distant areas. The Director, Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) shall issue guidance, as necessary, to implement the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B). Beneficiaries will be eligible for the same TDP benefits in the OCONUS service area although services may not be available or accessible in all OCONUS countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Agency. The provisions of this section apply throughout the Department of Defense (DoD), the United States Coast Guard, the USPHS and NOAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusion of benefit services performed in military dental care facilities. Except for emergency treatment, dental care provided outside the United States, services incidental to noncovered services, and services provided under paragraph (a)(2)(iv), dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members enrolled in the TDP may not obtain those services that are benefits of the TDP in military dental care facilities, as long as those covered benefits are available for cost-sharing under the TDP. Enrolled dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members may continue to obtain noncovered services from military dental care facilities subject to the provisions for space available care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exception to the exclusion of services performed in military dental care facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dependents who are 12 years of age or younger and are covered by a dental plan established under this section may be treated by postgraduate dental residents in a dental treatment facility of the uniformed services under a graduate dental education program accredited by the American Dental Association if</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of pediatric dental patients is necessary in order to satisfy an accreditation standard of the American Dental Association that is applicable to such program, or training in pediatric dental care is necessary for the residents to be professionally qualified to provide dental care for dependent children accompanying members of the uniformed services outside the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of pediatric patients at such facility is insufficient to support satisfaction of the accreditation or professional requirements in pediatric dental care that apply to such programs or students.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total number of dependents treated in all facilities of the uniformed services under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) in a fiscal year may not exceed 2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Authority and responsibility--(i) Legislative authority--(A) Joint regulations. 10 U.S.C. 1076a authorized the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Transportation, to prescribe regulations for the administration of the TDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Legislative authority--(A) Joint regulations. 10 U.S.C. 1076a authorized the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Transportation, to prescribe regulations for the administration of the TDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Joint regulations. 10 U.S.C. 1076a authorized the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Transportation, to prescribe regulations for the administration of the TDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Administration. 10 U.S.C. 1073 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to administer the TDP for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under DoD jurisdiction, the Secretary of Transportation to administer the TDP for the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer the TDP for the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS and the NOAA Corps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Organizational delegations and assignments--(A) Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)). The Secretary of Defense, by 32 CFR part 367, delegated authority to the ASD(HA) to provide policy guidance, management control, and coordination as required for all DoD health and medical resources and functional areas including health benefit programs. Implementing authority is contained in 32 CFR part 367. For additional implementing authority see Sec. 199.1. Any guidelines or policy necessary for implementation of this Sec. 199.13 shall be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)).

Any guidelines or policy necessary for implementation of this Sec. 199.13 shall be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Evidence of eligibility. DoD, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under the TDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Preemption of State and local laws. (i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, DoD has determined that, in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including, but not limited to, the assurance of uniform national health programs for Uniformed Service beneficiaries and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to DoD, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, DoD has determined that, in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including, but not limited to, the assurance of uniform national health programs for Uniformed Service beneficiaries and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to DoD, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health or dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or dental care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with the TDP contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TDP contract. (However, DoD may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of the dental plan contractor to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees, or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plan funds--(i) Funding sources. The funds used by the TDP are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation and funds collected by the Uniformed Services or contractor through payroll deductions or through direct billing as premium shares from beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Funding sources. The funds used by the TDP are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation and funds collected by the Uniformed Services or contractor through payroll deductions or through direct billing as premium shares from beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disposition of funds. TDP funds are paid by the Government (or in the case of direct billing, by the beneficiary) as premiums to an insurer, service, or prepaid dental care organization under a contract negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plan. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee provides an insurance policy, service plan, or prepaid contract of benefits in accordance with those prescribed by law and regulation; as interpreted and adjudicated in accord with the policy, service plan, or contract and a dental benefits brochure; and as prescribed by requirements of the dental plan contractor's contract with the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Contracting out. The method of delivery of the TDP is through a competitively procured contract. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for negotiating, under provisions of the FAR, a contract for dental benefits insurance or prepayment that includes responsibility for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Development, publication, and enforcement of benefit policy, exclusions, and limitations in compliance with the law, regulation, and the contract provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjudicating and processing claims; and conducting related supporting activities, such as enrollment, disenrollment, collection of premiums, eligibility verification, provider relations, and beneficiary communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Role of Health Benefits Advisor (HBA). The HBA is appointed (generally by the commander of an Uniformed Services medical treatment facility) to serve as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving the TDP. The HBA may assist beneficiaries in applying for benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relations with OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor. However, the HBA is not responsible for the TDP's policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate the TDP's funds. Advice given to beneficiaries by HBAs as to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or the dental plan contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Right to information. As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall be entitled to receive information from an authorized provider or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, State, or United States Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims for benefits are submitted. While establishing enrollment and eligibility, benefits, and benefit utilization and performance reporting information standards, the Government has established and does maintain a system of records for dental information under the TDP. By contract, the Government audits the adequacy and accuracy of

the dental plan contractor's system of records and requires access to information and records to meet plan accountabilities, to assist in contractor surveillance and program integrity investigations and to audit OCONUS financial transactions where the Department has a financial stake. Such information and records may relate to attendance, testing, monitoring, examination, or diagnosis of dental disease or conditions; or treatment rendered; or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary; and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration and payment of benefits under this plan. To assist in claims adjudication, grievance and fraud investigations, and the appeals process, and before an interim or final determination can be made on a claim of benefits, a beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or individual Ready Reserve member must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim and inability to effectively investigate the grievance or fraud or process the appeal. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure of such information is necessary to the determination by a provider or the dental plan contractor of beneficiary enrollment or eligibility for coverage of specific services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized Government officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disclosure constitutes a routine use of a routine use of a record which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. This includes a standard and acceptable business practice commonly used among dental insurers which is consistent with the principle of preserving confidentiality of personal information and detailed clinical data. For example, the release of utilization information for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain services, such as the number of dental prophylaxis procedures performed for a beneficiary, is authorized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Disclosure is pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Disclosure by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is for the purpose of determining the applicability of, and implementing the provisions of, other dental benefits coverage or entitlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Utilization review and quality assurance. Claims submitted for benefits under the TDP are subject to review by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, for quality of care and appropriate utilization. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is responsible for appropriate utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria consistent with the level of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For most definitions applicable to the provisions of this section, refer to Sec. 199.2. The following definitions apply only to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assignment of benefits. Acceptance by a nonparticipating provider of payment directly from the insurer while reserving the right to charge the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for any remaining amount of the fees for services which exceeds the prevailing fee allowance of the insurer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorized provider. A dentist, dental hygienist, or certified and licensed anesthetist specifically authorized to provide benefits under the TDP in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beneficiary. A dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, who has been enrolled in the TDP, and has been determined to be eligible for benefits, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Beneficiary liability. The legal obligation of a beneficiary, his or her estate, or responsible family member to pay for the costs of dental care or treatment received. Specifically, for the purposes of services and supplies covered by the TDP, beneficiary liability includes cost-sharing amounts or any amount above the prevailing fee determination by the insurer where the provider selected by the beneficiary is

not a participating provider or a provider within an approved alternative delivery system. In cases where a nonparticipating provider does not accept assignment of benefits, beneficiaries may have to pay the nonparticipating provider in full at the time of treatment and seek reimbursement directly from the insurer for all or a portion of the nonparticipating provider's fee. Beneficiary liability also includes any expenses for services and supplies not covered by the TDP, less any available discount provided as a part of the insurer's agreement with an approved alternative delivery system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> By report. Dental procedures which are authorized as benefits only in unusual circumstances requiring justification of exceptional conditions related to otherwise authorized procedures. These services are further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Contingency operation. Defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) as a military operation designated as a contingency operation by the Secretary of Defense or a military operation that results in the exercise of authorities for ordering Reserve Component members to active duty without their consent and is therefore automatically a contingency operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cost-share. The amount of money for which the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) is responsible in connection with otherwise covered dental services (other than disallowed amounts) as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A cost-share may also be referred to as a ``co-payment.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). The automated system that is composed of two (2) phases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enrolling all active duty, Reserve and retired service members, their dependents, and the dependents of deceased service members; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Verifying their eligibility for health care benefits in the direct care facilities and through the TDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Dental hygienist. Practitioner in rendering complete oral prophylaxis services, applying medication, performing dental radiography, and providing dental education services with a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree in the field, and licensed by an appropriate authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Dentist. Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) or Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) who is licensed to practice dentistry by an appropriate authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Diagnostic services. Category of dental services including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clinical oral examinations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Radiographic examinations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Diagnostic laboratory tests and examinations provided in connection with other dental procedures authorized as benefits of the TDP and further defined in paragraph (e) of the section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Endodontics. The etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries affecting the dental pulp, tooth root, and periapical tissue as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Initial determination. A formal written decision on a TDP claim, a request for TDP benefit pre-determination, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized provider, or a decision suspending, excluding or terminating a provider as an authorized provider under the TDP. Rejection of a claim or pre-determination, or of a request for benefit or provider authorization for failure to comply with administrative requirements, including failure to submit reasonably requested information, is not an initial determination. Responses to general or specific inquiries regarding TDP benefits are not initial determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Nonparticipating provider. A dentist or dental hygienist that furnished dental services to a TDP beneficiary, but who has not agreed to participate or to accept the insurer's fee allowances and applicable cost-share as the total charge for the services. A nonparticipating provider looks to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for final responsibility for payment of his or her charge, but may accept payment (assignment of benefits) directly from the insurer or assist the beneficiary in filing the claim for reimbursement by the dental plan contractor. Where the nonparticipating provider does not accept payment directly from the insurer, the insurer

pays the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, not the provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Oral and maxillofacial surgery. Surgical procedures performed in the oral cavity as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Orthodontics. The supervision, guidance, and correction of the growing or mature dentofacial structures, including those conditions that require movement of teeth or correction of malrelationships and malformations of their related structures and adjustment of relationships between and among teeth and facial bones by the application of forces and/or the stimulation and redirection of functional forces within the craniofacial complex as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Participating provider. A dentist or dental hygienist who has agreed to accept the insurer's reasonable fee allowances or other fee arrangements as the total charge (even though less than the actual billed amount), including provision for payment to the provider by the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) or any cost-share for covered services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Party to the initial determination. Includes the TDP, a beneficiary of the TDP and a participating provider of services whose interests have been adjudicated by the initial determination. In addition, provider who has been denied approval as an authorized TDP provider is a party to the initial determination, as is a provider who is suspended, excluded or terminated as an authorized provider, unless the provider is excluded or suspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Periodontics. The examination, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting the supporting structures of the teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Preventive services. Traditional prophylaxis including scaling deposits from teeth, polishing teeth, and topical application of fluoride to teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Prosthodontics.

A dentist, dental hygienist, or certified and licensed anesthetist as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. This term, when used in relation to OCONUS service area providers, may include other recognized professions authorized to furnish care under laws of that particular country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> Restorative services. Restoration of teeth including those procedures commonly described as amalgam restorations, resin restorations, pin retention, and stainless steel crowns for primary teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(24)</em> Sealants. A material designed for application on specified teeth to seal the surface irregularities to prevent ingress of oral fluids, food, and debris in order to prevent tooth decay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility and enrollment--(1) General. 10 U.S.C. 1076a, 1072(2)(A), (D), or (I), 1072(6), 10143 and 10144 set forth those persons who are eligible for voluntary enrollment in the TDP. A determination that a person is eligible for voluntary enrollment does not automatically entitle that person to benefit payments. The person must be enrolled in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section and meet any additional eligibility requirements in this part in order for dental benefits to be extended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. 10 U.S.C. 1076a, 1072(2)(A), (D), or (I), 1072(6), 10143 and 10144 set forth those persons who are eligible for voluntary enrollment in the TDP.

Procedures for the determination of eligibility are identified in Sec. 199.3(f)(2), except that Uniformed Service identification cards do not provide evidence of eligibility for the TDP. Although OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor must make determinations concerning a member or dependent's eligibility in order to ensure proper enrollment and proper disbursement of appropriated funds, ultimate responsibility for resolving a member or dependent's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Evidence of eligibility required. Eligibility and enrollment in the TDP will be verified through the DEERS. Eligibility and enrollment information established and maintained in the DEERS file is the only acceptable evidence of TDP eligibility and enrollment. It is the responsibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or TDP beneficiary, parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide adequate evidence for entry into the DEERS file to establish eligibility for the TDP, and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility are reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action. Ineligibility for benefits is presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Enrollment--(i) Previous plans--(A) Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan.

Enrollment of eligible dependents or members is for a period of one (1) year followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member chooses to continue enrollment. Active duty members may enroll their eligible dependents and eligible members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may enroll themselves or their eligible dependents in the TDP provided there is an intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year by the service member and their parent Uniformed Service. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TDP must remain enrolled for a minimum period of one (1) year unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special enrollment period for Reserve component members ordered to active duty in support of contingency operations. The mandatory twelve (12) month enrollment period does not apply to Reserve component members ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support of a contingency operation as designated by the Secretary of Defense. Affected Reserve component members may enroll in the TDP only if their orders specify that they are ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation, as defined by 10 U.S.C., for a period of thirty-one (31) days or more. An affected Reserve component member must elect to enroll in the TDP and complete the enrollment application within thirty (30) days following entry on active duty or within sixty (60) days following implementation of the TDP. Following enrollment, beneficiaries must remain enrolled, with the member paying premiums, until the end of the member's active duty period in support of the contingency operation or twelve (12) months, whichever occurs first unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continuation of enrollment from Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan.

A new one (1) year enrollment period will only be incurred if the active duty member disenrolls and attempts to reenroll in the TDP at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continuation of enrollment from TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program at the time when TDP coverage begins must complete their one (1) year enrollment period established under this former program except if one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met.

A new one (1) year enrollment period will only be incurred if the Selected Reserve member disenrolls and attempts to reenroll in the TDP at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Beginning dates of eligibility. The beginning date of eligibility for TDP benefits is the first day of the month following the month in which the election of enrollment is completed, signed, and the enrollment and premium is received by the dental plan contractor, subject to a predetermined and publicized dental plan contractor monthly cut-off date, except that the date of eligibility shall not be earlier than the first day of the month in which the TDP is implemented. This includes any changes between single and family member premium coverage and coverage of newly eligible or enrolled dependents or members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Changes in and termination of enrollment--(1) Changes in status of active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member. When the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is separated, discharged, retired, transferred to the Standby or Retired Reserve, his or her enrolled dependents and/or the enrolled Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member loses eligibility and enrollment as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month in which the change in status takes place. When the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days without a break in service, the member loses eligibility and is disenrolled, if previously enrolled; however, their enrolled dependents maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described in this section and in the TDP contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reserve component members separated from active duty in support of a contingency operation.

Thus the member has no requirement for the TDP and is not eligible to purchase the TDP. Upon the termination of Transitional Health Care eligibility, the member regains TDP eligibility and is reenrolled, if previously enrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dependents of members separated from active duty in support of a contingency operation.

During the member's Transitional Health Care eligibility, the dependents are considered family members of Reserve Component members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Members separated from active duty and not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1145(a)(2)(B). When the previously enrolled active duty member is transferred back to the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, and is not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1145(a)(2)(B), without a break in service, the member regains TDP eligibility and is reenrolled; however, enrolled dependents maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described

in this section and in the TDP contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Eligible dependents of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with a sentence of punitive discharge are still eligible for the TDP until such time as the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's discharge is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuation of eligibility. Eligible dependents of active duty members who die while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and eligible dependents of members of the Ready Reserve (i.e., Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143 and 10144(b) respectively) who die, shall be eligible for continued enrollment in the TDP. This continued enrollment shall be up to (3) three years from the date of the member's death, except that, in the case of a dependent of the deceased who is described in 10 U.S.C. section 1072(2) by subparagraph (D) or (I), the period of continued enrollment shall be the longer of the following periods beginning on the date of the member's death:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period ending on the date on which such dependent attains 21 years of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of such dependent who, at 21 years of age, is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the administering Secretary and was, at the time of the member's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support, the period ending on the earlier of the following dates: The date on which such dependent ceases to pursue such a course of study, as determined by the administering Secretary; or the date on which such dependent attains 23 years of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes in status of dependent--(i) Divorce. A spouse separated from an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member by a final divorce decree loses all eligibility based on his or her former marital relationship as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. The eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the divorce. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the termination of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Divorce. A spouse separated from an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member by a final divorce decree loses all eligibility based on his or her former marital relationship as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. The eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the divorce. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the termination of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annulment. A spouse whose marriage to an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is dissolved by annulment loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order. The fact that the annulment legally declares the entire marriage void from its inception does not affect the termination date of eligibility. When there are children, the eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the annulment. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the annulment of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adoption. A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who is adopted by a person, other than a person whose dependents are eligible for TDP benefits while the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is living, thereby severing the legal relationship between the child and the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the adoption becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Marriage of child. A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who marries a person whose dependents are not eligible for the TDP, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month in which the marriage takes place. However, should the marriage be terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is twenty-one (21) years old, the child again become eligible for enrollment as a dependent as of

12:00 a.m. of the first day of the month following the month in which the occurrence takes place that terminates the marriage and continues up to age twenty-one (21) if the child does not remarry before that time. If the marriage terminates after the child's 21st birthday, there is no reinstatement of eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Disabling illness or injury of child age 21 or 22 who has eligibility based on his or her student status. A child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old who is pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffers a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remains eligible for the TDP for six (6) months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, the TDP can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in full-time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in student status does not have eligibility related to mental or physical incapacity as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(C)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other--(i) Disenrollment because of no eligible beneficiaries.

When an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member ceases to have any eligible beneficiaries, enrollment is terminated for those enrolled dependents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Option to disenroll as a result of a change in active duty station. When an active duty member transfers with enrolled dependents to a duty station where space-available dental care for the enrolled dependents is readily available at the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the transfer, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP. If the active duty member is later transferred to a duty station where dental care for the dependents is not available in the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may reenroll their eligible dependents in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one (1) year. This disenrollment provision does not apply to enrolled dependents of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve or to enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Option to disenroll due to transfer to OCONUS service area. When an enrolled dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or an enrolled Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member relocates to locations within the OCONUS service area, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the relocation, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, to disenroll themselves from the TDP. The active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, may reenroll themselves in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Option to disenroll after an initial one (1) year enrollment. When a dependent's enrollment under an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or a Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own enrollment has been in effect for a continuous period of one (1) year, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may

disenroll their dependents, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may disenroll themselves at any time following procedures as set up by the dental plan contractor. Subsequent to the disenrollment, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may reenroll themselves, for another minimum period of one (1) year. If, during any one (1) year enrollment period, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member disenrolls their dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve disenrolls themselves, for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments, dependents enrolled under the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or enrolled members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve, will be subject to a lock-out period of twelve (12) months. Following this period of time, active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members will be able to reenroll their eligible dependents, or members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve will be able to reenroll themselves, if they so choose. The twelve (12) month lock-out period applies to enrolled dependents of a Reserve component member who disenrolls for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments after the member has enrolled pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Premium sharing--(1) General.

The following table lists maximum active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member and dependent cost-shares for covered services for participating and nonparticipating providers of care (see paragraph (f)(6) of this section for additional active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve costs). These are percentages of the dental plan contractor's determined allowable amount that the active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member or beneficiary must pay to these providers. For care received in the OCONUS service area, the ASD(HA), or designee,

may pay certain cost-shares and other portions of a provider's billed charge for enrolled dependents of active duty members (under a call or order that does not specify a period of thirty (30) days or less), and for members of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143) and Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(b)) enrolled on their own behalf.</p><p class="depth0">[In percent]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Cost-share</p><p class="depth0">for pay     Cost-share</p><p class="depth0">Covered services                 grades E-1,    for all</p><p class="depth0">E-2, E-3    other pay</p><p class="depth0">and E-4       grades------------------------------------------------------------------------Diagnostic....................................            0            0Preventive, except Sealants...................            0            0Emergency Services............................            0            0Sealants......................................           20           20Professional Consultations....................           20           20Professional Visits...........................           20           20Post Surgical Services........................           20           20Basic Restorative (example: amalgams, resins,            20           20</p><p class="depth0">stainless steel crowns)......................Endodontic....................................           30           40Periodontic...................................           30           40Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery................           30           40General Anesthesia............................           40           40Intravenous Sedation..........................           50           50Other Restorative (example: crowns, onlays,              50           50</p><p class="depth0">casts).......................................Prosthodontics................................           50           50Medications...................................           50           50Orthodontic...................................           50           50Miscellaneous.................................           50           50------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dental plan contractor liability. When more than twenty-five (25) percent or more than two hundred (200) enrollees in a specific five (5) digit zip code area are unable to obtain a periodic or initial (non-emergency) dentistry appointment with a network provider within twenty-one (21) calendar days and within thirty-five (35) miles of the enrollee's place of residence, then the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) will designate that area as ``non-compliant with the access standard.'' Once so designated, the dental program contractor will reimburse the beneficiary, or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or the nonparticipating provider selected by enrollees in that area (or a subset of the area or nearby zip codes in other five (5) digit zip code areas as determined by TMA) at the level of the provider's usual fees less the applicable enrollee cost-share, if any. TMA shall determine when such area becomes compliant with the access standards. This access standard and associated liability does not apply to care received in the OCONUS service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maximum coverage amounts. Beneficiaries are subject to an annual maximum coverage amount for non-orthodontic dental benefits and a lifetime maximum coverage amount for orthodontics as established by the ASD (HA) or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Authorized providers--(1) General. Beneficiaries may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care or covered anesthesia benefits in the state where the provider is located. This includes licensed dental hygienists, practicing within the scope of their licensure, subject to any restrictions a state licensure or legislative body imposes regarding their status as independent providers of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Beneficiaries may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care or covered anesthesia benefits in the state where the provider is located. This includes licensed dental hygienists, practicing within the scope of their licensure, subject to any restrictions a state licensure or legislative body imposes regarding their status as independent providers of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorized provider status does not guarantee payment of benefits. The fact that a provider is ``authorized'' is not to be construed to mean that the TDP will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, also must determine if the patient is an eligible beneficiary, whether the services or supplies billed are authorized and medically necessary, and whether any of the authorized exclusions of otherwise qualified providers presented in this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Utilization review and quality assurance. Services and supplies furnished by providers of care shall be subject to utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria established under the TDP. Utilization review and quality assurance assessments shall be performed under the TDP consistent with the nature and level of benefits of the plan, and shall include analysis of the data and findings by the dental plan contractor from other dental accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provider required. In order to be considered benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a TDP authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Participating provider. An authorized provider may elect to participate for all TDP beneficiaries and accept the fee or charge determinations as established and made known to the provider by the dental plan contractor. The fee or charge determinations are binding upon the provider in accordance with the dental plan contractor's procedures for participation. The authorized provider may not participate on a claim-by-claim basis. The participating provider must agree to accept, within one (1) day of a request for appointment, beneficiaries in need of emergency palliative treatment. Payment to the participating provider is based on the lower of the actual charge or the dental plan contractor's determination of the allowable charge; however, payments to participating providers shall be in accordance with the methodology specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. Payment is made directly to the participating provider, and the participating provider may only charge the beneficiary the percent cost-share of the dental plan contractor's allowable charge for those benefit categories as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in addition to the full charges for any services not authorized as benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Nonparticipating provider. An authorized provider may elect to not participate for all TDP beneficiaries and request the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member to pay any amount of the provider's billed charge in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges (to include the appropriate cost-share). Neither the Government nor the dental plan contractor shall have any responsibility for any amounts over the allowable charges as determined by the dental plan contractor, except where the dental plan contractor is unable to identify a participating provider of care within thirty-five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence with appointment availability within twenty-one (21) calendar days. In such instances of the nonavailability of a participating provider and in accordance with the provisions of the dental contract, the nonparticipating provider located within thirty-five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence shall be paid his or her usual fees (either by the beneficiary or the dental plan contractor if the beneficiary elected assignment of benefits), less the percent cost-share as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assignment of benefits. A nonparticipating provider may accept assignment of benefits for claims (for beneficiaries certifying their willingness to make such assignment of benefits) by filing the claims completed with the assistance of the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the dental plan contractor to the provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No assignment of benefits. A nonparticipating provider for all beneficiaries may request that the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member file the claim directly with the dental plan contractor, making arrangements with the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Alternative delivery system--(i) General. Alternative delivery systems may be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, as authorized providers. Only dentists, dental hygienists and licensed anesthetists shall be authorized to provide or direct the provision of authorized services and supplies in an approved alternative delivery system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Alternative delivery systems may be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, as authorized providers. Only dentists, dental hygienists and licensed anesthetists shall be authorized to provide or direct the provision of authorized services and supplies in an approved alternative delivery system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Defined. An alternative delivery system may be any approved arrangement for a preferred provider organization, capitation plan, dental health maintenance or clinic organization, or other contracted arrangement which is approved by OCHAMPUS in accordance with requirements and guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Elective or exclusive arrangement. Alternative delivery systems may be established by contract or other arrangement on either an elective or exclusive basis for beneficiary selection of participating and authorized providers in accordance with contractual requirements and guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provider election of participation. Otherwise authorized providers must

be provided with the opportunity of applying for participation in an alternative delivery system and of achieving participation status based on reasonable criteria for timeliness of application, quality of care, cost containment, geographic location, patient availability, and acceptance of reimbursement allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Limitation on authorized providers. Where exclusive alternative delivery systems are established, only providers participating in the alternative delivery system are authorized providers of care. In such instances, the TDP shall continue to pay beneficiary claims for services rendered by otherwise authorized providers in accordance with established rules for reimbursement of nonparticipating providers where the beneficiary has established a patient relationship with the nonparticipating provider prior to the TDP's proposal to subcontract with the alternative delivery system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Charge agreements. Where the alternative delivery system employs a discounted fee-for-service reimbursement methodology or schedule of charges or rates which includes all or most dental services and procedures recognized by the American Dental Association's Council on Dental Care Program's Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature, the discounts or schedule of charges or rates for all dental services and procedures shall be extended by its participating providers to beneficiaries of the TDP as an incentive for beneficiary participation in the alternative delivery system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Benefit payment--(1) General. TDP benefits payments are made either directly to the provider or to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, depending on the manner in which the claim is submitted or the terms of the subcontract of an alternative delivery system with the dental plan contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. TDP benefits payments are made either directly to the provider or to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, depending on the manner in which the claim is submitted or the terms of the subcontract of an alternative delivery system with the dental plan contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefit payment. Beneficiaries are not required to utilize participating providers. For beneficiaries who do use these participating providers, however, these providers shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment allowed by the dental plan contractor for covered services. Beneficiaries using nonparticipating providers may be balance-billed amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges. The following general requirements for the TDP benefit payment methodology shall be met, subject to modifications and exceptions approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonparticipating providers (or the Beneficiaries or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members for unassigned claims) shall be reimbursed at the equivalent of not less than the 50th percentile of prevailing charges made for similar services in the same locality (region) or state, or the provider's actual charge, whichever is lower, subject to the exception listed in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participating providers shall be reimbursed in accordance with the contractor's network agreements, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest. The provisions of Sec. 199.9 shall apply except for Sec. 199.9(e). All references to ``CHAMPUS contractors'', ``CHAMPUS beneficiaries'' and ``CHAMPUS providers'' in Sec. 199.9 shall be construed to mean the ``dental plan contractor'', ``TDP beneficiaries'' and ``TPD providers'' respectively for the purposes of this section. Examples of fraud include situations in which ineligible persons not enrolled in the TDP obtain care and file claims for benefits under the name and identification of a beneficiary; or when providers submit claims for services and supplies not rendered to Beneficiaries; or when a participating provider bills the beneficiary for amounts over the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges; or when a provider fails to collect the specified patient cost-share amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Appeal and hearing procedures. The provisions of Sec. 199.10 shall apply except where noted in this section. All references to ``CHAMPUS contractors'', ``CHAMPUS beneficiaries'', ``CHAMPUS participating providers'' and ``CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits'' in Sec. 199.10 shall be construed to

mean the ``dental plan contractor'', ``TDP beneficiaries'', ``TDP participating providers'' and ``Dental Explanation of Benefits or DEOB'' respectively for the purposes of this section. References to ``OCHAMPUSEUR'' in Sec. 199.10 are not applicable to the TDP or this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

Participation in an appeal is limited to any party to the initial determination, including OCHAMPUS, the dental plan contractor, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any party to the initial determination, except OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor, may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party who actually files the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Parties to the initial determination. See Secs. 199.10(a)(2)(i) and 199.10(a)(2)(i) (A), (B), (C) and (E).

See Sec. 199.10(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Late filing. If a request for reconsideration, formal review, or hearing is filed after the time permitted in this section, written notice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted only if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the dental plan contractor, or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, that timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exception to the filing requirement shall be final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Appealable issue. See Secs. 199.10(a)(6), 199.10(a)(6)(i), 199.10(a)(6)(iv), including Secs. 199.10(a)(6)(iv) (A) and (C), and 199.10(a)(6)(v) for an explanation and examples of non-appealable issues. Other examples of issues that are not appealable under this section include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the dental plan contractor-determined allowable charge since the methodology constitutes a limitation on benefits under the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain other issues on the basis that the authority for the initial determination is not vested in OCHAMPUS. Such issues include but are not limited to the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A determination of a person's enrollment in the TDP is the responsibility of the dental plan contractor and ultimate responsibility for resolving a beneficiary's enrollment rests with the dental plan contractor. Accordingly, a disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's enrollment will not be considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall be resolved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and the dental plan contractor's enrollment policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Decisions relating to the issuance of a nonavailability statement (NAS) in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for an NAS or a refusal to issue an NAS are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a dental emergency for which an NAS is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to include a provider in their network or to designate a provider as participating is not appealable under this section. Similarly, any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to exclude a provider from their network or to deny participating provider status is not appealable under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Amount in dispute--(A) General.

under the provisions of this section, except as set forth or further explained in Sec. 199.10(a)(7)(ii), (iii) and (iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Calculated amount. The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money the dental plan contractor would pay if the services involved in the dispute were determined to be authorized benefits of the TDP. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by this section from payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's--determined allowable charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The beneficiary's cost-share amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts that the beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or other responsible person has no legal obligation to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts excluded under the provisions of Sec. 199.8 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Levels of appeal.
