                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> with respect to  exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an  election under section 615(e) if the taxpayer files the notice described  in paragraph (c) of this section or the taxpayer revokes his election  under section 615(e) before the date prescribed for the filing of notice  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing of notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The notice not to have a  section 615(e) election treated as a section 617(a) election shall be  made in a statement filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue  service center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to  be filed. If the election is made within the time period prescribed for  filing an income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first  taxable year during which the taxpayer pays or incurs, after December  31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by the taxpayer under  section 617(a) if he made a valid election to deduct exploration  expenditures under such section, the statement shall be attached to the  taxpayer's income tax return for such year. If the statement is filed  after the time prescribed for filing such return but before the  expiration of the period (described in paragraph (e) of this section)  for filing the notice, the statement must be signed by the taxpayer or  his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed even though  the taxpayer charges to capital account all such expenditures paid or  incurred by him after December 31, 1969. If the taxpayer desires, he may  file this statement by attaching it to his return for a taxable year  prior to the first taxable year in which he pays or incurs after  December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by him under  section 617(a) if at such time he had in effect a valid election under  such section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information to be furnished. The notice shall clearly state that  the taxpayer elects not to have his section 615(e) election treated as  an election under section 617(a). The notice shall state the first  taxable year for which the section 615(e) election was effective   and with whom and where the election was filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of notification. A taxpayer who has filed notice pursuant  to this section may make an election under section 617(a) with respect  to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969,  without revoking either his section 615(e) election or his notice under  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time for filing notice. A taxpayer may not file the notice  described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section after the expiration of  the 3-year period beginning with the date prescribed by section 6072 or  other provision of law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for  the first taxable year in which the taxpayer pays or incurs after  December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by him if he  made the election under section 617(a). This 3-year period shall be  determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the  taxpayer's income tax return.  [T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12941, June 30, 1972]</p>
