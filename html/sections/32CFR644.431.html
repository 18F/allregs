Pursuant to the provisions of section 13(d) of the  Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended (50 U.S.C., App. 1622(d)), any  state, or political subdivision thereof, or any state or Government  agency or instrumentality may certify to the disposal agency that a  surplus power transmission line and the right of way acquired for its  construction is needed for or adaptable to the requirements of a public  or cooperative power project. Whenever any property is reported to GSA  for screening, it will be assumed that GSA has screened Federal agencies  for such purpose and no further screening with such agencies is  necessary. Property not reported to GSA for screening will be screened  in accordance with Sec. Sec. 644.333 through 644.339. Screening with  the appropriate state agencies will be conducted in all cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. Whenever a State, or political subdivision thereof,  or state or Federal agency or instrumentality certifies that such  property is needed for or adaptable to the requirements of a public or  cooperative power project, the property may be sold for such utilization  at its appraised fair market value. In the event that a sale cannot be  consummated and the certification is not withdrawn, such facts will be  reported to DAEN-REM in order that a determination of the action to be  taken may be obtained from the Administrator, GSA. If no certification  from a state or Federal instrumentality as outlined above is received  after proper notice is given, the property may be disposed of in the  same manner as other excess or surplus real property.</p>
