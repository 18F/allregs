                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction. An auxiliary exhaust gas boiler must meet the  applicable construction requirements of part 52 or part 53 of this  chapter as determined from Sec. 54.01-5, Table 54.01-5(A) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Controls. Each drum type exhaust gas steam boiler must have a  feed water control system. The system must automatically supply the  required amount of feed water and maintain it at the proper level. For  boilers without a fixed water level, the control system must supply the  feed water at a rate sufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. The  system must adequately fill the boiler when cold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alarms. When a condition arises which results in inadequate heat  transfer, a high temperature alarm or low flow alarm must be activated.  An audible alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must  indicate when the fluid temperature exceeds the maximum operating  temperature or when the fluid/steam flowing through the heat exchanger  is insufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. Additionally, an audible  alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must indicate  when a soot fire is present in the exhaust gas boiler's uptake.</p>
