However, aid, benefits and services, to be equally effective, need not produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate in its regular aid, benefits, or services, despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services which are established in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, use criteria or methods of administration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped individuals to discrimination on the basis of handicap;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In determining the geographic site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That have the effect of excluding handicapped individuals from, denying them the benefit of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased, rented or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)(i)</em> In providing services, recipients to which this subpart applies, except

small recipients, shall ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of auxiliary aids for participants with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills. A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this subpart applies so that, when viewed in its entirety, auxiliary aids are readily available. The Secretary may require small recipients to provide auxiliary aids in order to ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by small recipients, when this would not significantly impair the ability of the small recipient to provide benefits or services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In providing services, recipients to which this subpart applies, except

small recipients, shall ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of auxiliary aids for participants with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills.

Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal law. The exclusion of non-handicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or Executive order to handicapped individuals, or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped individuals from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of handicapped individuals is not prohibited by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Integrated setting.
