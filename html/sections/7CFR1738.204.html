                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Agency will publish a public notice of each application. The application must provide a summary of the information required for such public notice including all of the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identity of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A map of each service area showing the rural area boundaries and the unserved areas using the Agency's Mapping Tool;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount and type of support requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The status of the review of the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The estimated number of unserved households in each service area exclusive of satellite broadband service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of all the types of services that the applicant proposes to offer in each service area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A list of the census block groups proposed to be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Agency will publish the public notice on an Agency Web page after the application has been received in the Agency's National Office and will remain on the Web page for a period of 30 calendar days. The notice will ask existing service providers to submit to the Agency, within this notice period, the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of residential and business customers within the applicant's service area that are currently offered broadband service by the existing service provider;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of residential and business customers within the applicant's service area currently purchasing the existing service provider's broadband service, the rates of data transmission being offered, and the cost of each level of broadband service charged by the existing service provider;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of residential and business customers within the applicant's service area receiving the existing service provider's non-broadband services and the associated rates for these other services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A map showing where the existing service provider's services coincide with the applicant's service area using the Agency's Mapping Tool; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the existing service provider is an existing RUS borrower or grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Agency will use the information submitted to determine if the existing service provider will be classified as an incumbent service provider. Notwithstanding non-responses by existing providers, the Agency will use all information available to it in evaluating the feasibility of the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Agency will determine whether the service areas included in the application are eligible for funding based on all available information. If part or parts of the applicant's proposed funded service area are ineligible, the Agency will contact the applicant and require that those ineligible areas be removed from the proposed funded service area or that other funding be provided. If the ineligible service areas are not removed from the funding request or additional funds are not provided, the Agency will reject the application. Given that applications may need to be revised to reflect modified service areas, applicants are encouraged to re-submit their applications as soon as possible to avoid that their applications will not be considered for the current evaluation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The information submitted by an existing service provider will be treated as proprietary and confidential to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an application is approved, an additional notice will be published on the agency's Web site that will include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the entity receiving the financial assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of assistance being received; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The purpose of the assistance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The semiannual reports submitted under Sec. 1738.254(e).</p>
