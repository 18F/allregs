                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A service provider that contributes to the universal service  support mechanisms under subpart H of this part and also provides  services eligible for support under this subpart to eligible health care  providers may, at the election of the contributor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treat the amount eligible for support under this subpart as an  offset against the contributor's universal service support obligation  for the year in which the costs for providing eligible services were  incurred; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receive direct reimbursement from the Administrator for that  amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service providers that are contributors shall elect in January  of each year the method by which they will be reimbursed and shall  remain subject to that method for the duration of the calendar year. Any  support amount that is owed a service provider that fails to remit its  monthly universal service contribution obligation, however, shall first  be applied as an offset to that contributor's contribution obligation.  Such a service provider shall remain subject to the offsetting method  for the remainder of the calendar year in which it failed to remit its  monthly universal service obligation. A service provider that continues  to be in arrears on its universal service contribution obligations at  the end of a calendar year shall remain subject to the offsetting method  for the next calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a service provider providing services eligible for support  under this subpart elects to treat that support amount as an offset  against its universal service contribution obligation and the total  amount of support owed exceeds its universal service obligation,  calculated on an annual basis, the service provider shall receive a  direct reimbursement in the amount of the difference. Any such  reimbursement due a service provider shall be provided by the  Administrator no later than the end of the first quarter of the calendar  year following the year in which the costs were incurred and the offset  against the contributor's universal service obligation was applied.
