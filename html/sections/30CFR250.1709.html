To obtain approval, you must submit with your APM, your reasons for displacing the kill-weight fluid and provide detailed step-by-step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Number and type of independent barriers, as described in Sec.  250.420(b)(3), that are in place for each flow path that requires such barriers,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent barriers,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill weight fluids, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures you will use to monitor the volumes and rates of fluids entering and leaving the wellbore.
