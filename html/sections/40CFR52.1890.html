                            <p class="depth0">On the dates listed below, Ohio requested that the indicated control measures be removed from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On February 21, 1997, the State of Ohio requested that the following rules

and rule paragraphs be removed from the SIP because they have been amended or revoked by the State subsequent to their incorporation in the SIP: OAC 3745-21-02(C), OAC 3745-21-03(D), OAC 3745-21-05, OAC 3745-22-01, OAC 3745-22-02, OAC 3745-22-03, OAC 3745-22-04, OAC 3745-22-05, OAC 3745-22-06, OAC 3745-22-07, OAC 3745-22-08, OAC 3745-23-03, OAC 3745-23-04, OAC 3745-23-05, and OAC 3745-102-07.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On April 11, 2005, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted a request to revise the State's plan controlling nitrogen oxide emissions from stationary sources in the State. The request included the results of the action taken by Ohio EPA to rescind OAC 3745-23-06, which affected emissions of oxides of nitrogen from combustion sources and nitric acid plants. This action was preceded by a negative declaration regarding nitric acid plants dated April 11, 1994, and rule approvals (NOX SIP Call, NSPS, budget trading program, etc.) affecting large fossil-fueled utility and industrial boilers. OAC 3745-23-06, Control of nitrogen oxide emissions from stationary sources, also known as AP-7-06 in its original form, is therefore removed from the Ohio SIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On August 22, 2008, Ohio requested that Ohio Administrative Code 3745-17-05 ``Non-degradation Policy.'' be removed from the Ohio SIP. The rule was rescinded statewide on February 1, 2008.
