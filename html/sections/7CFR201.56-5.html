Secondary or adventitious roots may develop within the test period. In certain kinds (e.g. bermudagrass) the primary root may not be readily visible because it is coiled inside the tightly fitting lemma and palea. At the time of evaluation, the glumes should be removed and the root observed. Such seedlings are classified as normal if the primary root has developed. For Kentucky bluegrass, a primary root \1/16\ inch (1.6 mm) or more in length is classified as normal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Abnormal seedling description.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shoot:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Missing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Short, thick, and grainy.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> No leaf.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Leaf extending less than halfway up into the coleoptile.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Leaf extensively shredded or split.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Spindly or watery.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Deep open cracks in the mesocotyl.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Root:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Missing or defective primary root even if other roots are present.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Spindly, stubby, or watery primary root.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Seedling:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Decayed at point of attachment to the scutellum.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> One or more essential structures impaired as a result of decay from primary infection.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Albino.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Yellow (when grown in light).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Endosperm obviously detached from the root-shoot axis (e.g. kernel lifted away by the growing shoot).
