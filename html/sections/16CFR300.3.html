The information required to be shown  and displayed upon the product in the stamp, tag, label, or other mark  of identification, shall be that which is required by the Act and the  rules and regulations thereunder, including the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fiber content of the product specified in section 4(a)(2)(A)  of the Act. The generic names and percentages by weight of the  constituent fibers present in the wool product, exclusive of permissive  ornamentation, shall appear on such label with any percentage of fiber  or fibers designated as ``other fiber'' or ``other fibers'' as provided  by section 4(a)(2)(A)(4) of the Act appearing last</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name or registered identification number issued by the  Commission of the manufacturer of the wool product or the name or  registered identification number of one or more persons subject to  section 3 of the Act with respect to such wool product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name of the country where the wool product was processed or  manufactured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In disclosing the constituent fibers in information required by  the Act and regulations in this part or in any non-required information,  no fiber present in the amount of less than 5 percent shall be  designated by its generic name or fiber trademark but shall be  designated as ``other fiber,'' except that the percentage of wool or  recycled wool shall always be stated, in accordance with section  4(a)(2)(A) of the Act. When more than one of such fibers, other than  wool or recycled wool, are present in amounts of less than 5 percent,  they shall be designated in the aggregate as ``other fibers.'' Provided,  however, that nothing in this section shall prevent the disclosure of  any fiber present in the product which has a clearly established and  definite functional significance when present in the amount stated, as  for example:  ``98% wool 2% nylon.''
