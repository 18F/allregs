The provisions of this section shall apply separately for each refinery owned or operated by a NRLM diesel fuel small refiner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Other provisions. From June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010, a refiner who is an approved motor vehicle diesel fuel small refiner under Sec. 80.550(a) but does not qualify as a NRLM diesel fuel small refiner under Sec. 80.550(b) may produce NRLM diesel fuel that is exempt from the per-gallon sulfur standard and the cetane or aromatics standard of Sec. 80.510(a). This exemption does not apply to diesel fuel sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in Sec. 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2). From June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2012, NR and LM diesel fuel

produced by such refiners is subject to the standards under Sec. 80.510(b) and beginning June 1, 2012, all NRLM diesel fuel is subject to the standards under Sec. 80.510(c).
