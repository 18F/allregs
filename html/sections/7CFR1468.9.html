                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The conservation farm plan forms the basis of the CFO contract.  Prior to contract approval, a conservation farm plan must be written and  approved. In deciding whether to approve a conservation farm plan, CCC  may consider whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participant will use conservation practices to solve the  natural resource concerns that will maximize environmental benefits per  dollar expended, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conservation practice would have been eligible for  enrollment in the CRP, EQIP, or under the WRP cost-share agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The conservation farm plan for the farm or ranch unit of concern  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe any resource conserving crop rotation, and all other  conservation practices, to be implemented and maintained on the acreage  that is subject to contract during the contact period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Address the resource concerns identified in the CFO pilot  project area proposal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contain a schedule for the implementation and maintenance of the  practices described in the conservation farm plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ensure that net environmental benefits under a CRP contract are  maintained or exceeded for the whole farm, as constituted by FSA, when  terminating a CRP contract and enrolling in a CFO contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Meet the objectives of the pilot project area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The conservation farm plan is part of the CFO contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The conservation farm plan must allow the participant to achieve  a cost-effective resource management system, or some appropriate portion  of that system, identified in the applicable NRCS field office technical  guide or as approved by the State Conservationist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Participants are responsible for implementing the conservation  farm plan in compliance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon a participant's request, the NRCS may provide technical  assistance to a participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participants may, at their own cost, use qualified  professionals, other than NRCS personnel, to provide technical  assistance. NRCS retains approval authority over the technical adequacy  of work done by non-NRCS personnel for the purpose of determining CFO  contract compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical and other assistance provided by qualified personnel  not affiliated with NRCS may include, but not limited to: conservation  planning; conservation practice survey, layout, design, and  installation; information, education, and training for producers; and  training and quality assurance for professional conservationists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All conservation practices scheduled in the conservation farm  plan are to be carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS Field  Office Technical Guide. The State Conservationist may approve use of  innovative conservation measures that are not contained in the NRCS  Field Office Technical Guide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To simplify the conservation planning process for the  participant, the conservation farm plan may be developed, at the request  of the participant, as a single plan that incorporates, other Federal,  state, Tribal, or local government program or regulatory requirements.  CCC development or approval of a conservation farm plan shall not  constitute compliance with program, statutory and regulatory  requirements administered or enforced by a non-USDA agency, except as  agreed to by the participant and the relevant Federal, state, local or  tribal entities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CCC may accept an existing conservation plan developed and  required for participation in any other CCC or USDA program if the  conservation plan otherwise meets the requirements of this part. When a  participant develops a single conservation farm plan for more than one  program, the participant shall clearly identify the portions of the plan  that are applicable to the CFO contract. It is the responsibility of the  participant to ascertain and comply with all applicable statutory and  regulatory requirements.</p>
