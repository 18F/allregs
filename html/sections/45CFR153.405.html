                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The reinsurance contribution required from a  contributing entity for its reinsurance contribution enrollees during a  benefit year is calculated by multiplying:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the contributing entity; by</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contribution rate for the applicable benefit year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual enrollment count. No later than November 15 of benefit  year 2014, 2015, or 2016, as applicable, or, if such date is not a  business day, the next business day, a contributing entity must submit  an annual enrollment count of the number of covered lives of reinsurance  contribution enrollees for the applicable benefit year to HHS. The count  must be determined as specified in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this  section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification and payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following submission of the annual  enrollment count described in paragraph (b) of this section, HHS will  notify the contributing entity of the reinsurance contribution amount  allocated to reinsurance payments, administrative expenses, and the U.S.  Treasury to be paid for the applicable benefit year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contributing entity must remit reinsurance contributions to  HHS no later than January 15, 2015, 2016, or 2017, as applicable, or, if  such date is not a business day, the next business day, if making a  combined contribution or the first payment of the bifurcated  contribution, and no later than November 15, 2015, 2016, or 2017, as  applicable, or, if such date is not a business day, the next business  day, if   making the second payment of the bifurcated contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for counting covered lives for health insurance  issuers. A health insurance issuer must use the same method in a benefit  year for all of its health insurance plans in the State (including both  the individual and group markets) for which reinsurance contributions  are required. To determine the number of covered lives of reinsurance  contribution enrollees under all health insurance plans in a State for a  benefit year, a health insurance issuer must use one of the following  methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adding the total number of lives covered for each day of the  first nine months of the benefit year and dividing that total by the  number of days in the first nine months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adding the total number of lives covered on any date (or more  dates, if an equal number of dates are used for each quarter) during the  same corresponding month in each of the first three quarters of the  benefit year, and dividing that total by the number of dates on which a  count was made. For this purpose, the same months must be used for each  quarter (for example January, April and July) and the date used for the  second and third quarter must fall within the same week of the quarter  as the corresponding date used for the first quarter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiplying the average number of policies in effect for the  first nine months of the benefit year by the ratio of covered lives per  policy in effect, calculated using the prior National Association of  Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Supplemental Health Care Exhibit (or a  form filed with the issuer's State of domicile for the most recent time  period).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures for counting covered lives for self-insured group  health plans. To determine the number of covered lives of reinsurance  contribution enrollees under a self-insured group health plan for a  benefit year, a plan must use one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or  paragraph (d)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adding the total number of lives covered on any date (or more  dates, if an equal number of dates are used for each quarter) during the  same corresponding month in each of the first three quarters of the  benefit year (provided that the date used for the second and third  quarters must fall within the same week of the quarter as the  corresponding date used for the first quarter), and dividing that total  by the number of dates on which a count was made, except that the number  of lives covered on a date is calculated by adding the number of  participants with self-only coverage on the date to the product of the  number of participants with coverage other than self-only coverage on  the date and a factor of 2.35. For this purpose, the same months must be  used for each quarter (for example, January, April, and July); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, the  number of lives covered for the plan year for a plan offering only self- only coverage equals the sum of the total participants covered at the  beginning and end of the plan year, as reported on the Form 5500,  divided by 2, and the number of lives covered for the plan year for a  plan offering self-only coverage and coverage other than self-only  coverage equals the sum of the total participants covered at the  beginning and the end of the plan year, as reported on the Form 5500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures for counting covered lives for group health plans  with a self-insured coverage option and an insured coverage option. (1)  To determine the number of covered lives of reinsurance contribution  enrollees under a group health plan with a self-insured coverage option  and an insured coverage option for a benefit year, a plan must use one  of the methods specified in either paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or paragraph (d)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1), a plan with multiple coverage  options may use any of the counting methods specified for self-insured  coverage or insured coverage, as applicable to each option, if it  determines the number of   covered lives under each option separately as if each coverage option  provided major medical coverage (not including any coverage option that  consists solely of excepted benefits as defined by section 2791(c) of  the PHS Act, that only provides benefits related to prescription drugs,  or that is a health reimbursement arrangement, health savings account,  or health flexible spending arrangement).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple group health plans maintained by the same plan  sponsor--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If a plan sponsor maintains two or more group  health plans (including one or more group health plans that provide  health insurance coverage) that collectively provide major medical  coverage for the same covered lives simultaneously, then those multiple  plans must be treated as a single group health plan for purposes of  calculating any reinsurance contribution amount due under this section.  However, a plan sponsor may treat the multiple plans as separate group  health plans for purposes of calculating any reinsurance contribution  due under this section if it determines the number of covered lives  under each separate group health plan as if the separate group health  plan provided major medical coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plan sponsor. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term  ``plan sponsor'' means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer, in the case of a plan established or maintained by  a single employer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee organization, in the case of a plan established or  maintained by an employee organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The joint board of trustees, in the case of a multiemployer  plan (as defined in section 414(f) of the Code);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The committee, in the case of a multiple employer welfare  arrangement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The cooperative or association that establishes or maintains a  plan established or maintained by a rural electric cooperative or rural  cooperative association (as such terms are defined in section 3(40)(B)  of ERISA);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The trustee, in the case of a plan established or maintained by  a voluntary employees' beneficiary association (meaning that the  association is not merely serving as a funding vehicle for a plan that  is established or maintained by an employer or other person);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In the case of a plan, the sponsor of which is not described  in paragraph (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(vi) of this section, the person  identified by the terms of the document under which the plan is operated  as the plan sponsor, or the person designated by the terms of the  document under which the plan is operated as the plan sponsor, provided  that designation is made, and that person has consented to the  designation, by no later than the date by which the count of covered  lives for that benefit year is required to be provided, after which date  that designation for that benefit year may not be changed or revoked,  and provided further that a person may be designated as the plan sponsor  only if the person is one of the persons maintaining the plan (for  example, one of the employers that is maintaining the plan with one or  more other employers or employee organizations); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> In the case of a plan, the sponsor of which is not described  in paragraph (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(vi) of this section, and for which  no identification or designation of a plan sponsor has been made under  paragraph (g)(2)(i)(vii) of this section, each employer that maintains  the plan (with respect to employees of that employer), each employee  organization that maintains the plan (with respect to members of that  employee organization), and each board of trustees, cooperative or  association that maintains the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception. A plan sponsor is not required to include as part of  a single group health plan as determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this  section any group health plan that consists solely of excepted benefits  as defined by section 2791(c) of the PHS Act, that only provides  benefits related to prescription drugs, or that is a health  reimbursement arrangement, health savings account, or health flexible  spending arrangement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> govern the determination of the average number of covered lives  in a benefit year for any set of multiple self-insured group health  plans or health insurance plans (or a   combination of one or more self-insured group health plans and one or  more health insurance plans) that are treated as a single group health  plan under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Multiple group health plans including an insured plan. If at  least one of the multiple plans is an insured plan, the average number  of covered lives of reinsurance contribution enrollees must be  calculated using one of the methods specified in either paragraph (d)(1)  or (2) of this section, applied across the multiple plans as a whole.  The following information must be determined by the plan sponsor:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The average number of covered lives calculated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The counting method used; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The names of the multiple plans being treated as a single group  health plan as determined by the plan sponsor and reported to HHS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple group health plans not including an insured plan. If  each of the multiple plans is a self-insured group health plan, the  average number of covered lives of reinsurance contribution enrollees  must be calculated using one of the methods specified either in  paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, applied across the multiple  plans as a whole. The following information must be determined by the  plan sponsor:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The average number of covered lives calculated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The counting method used; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The names of the multiple plans being treated as a single group  health plan as determined by the plan sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Maintenance of records. A contributing entity must maintain  documents and records, whether paper, electronic, or in other media,  sufficient to substantiate the enrollment count submitted pursuant to  this section for a period of at least 10 years, and must make those  documents and records available upon request from HHS, the OIG, the  Comptroller General, or their designees, to any such entity, for  purposes of verification, investigation, audit, or other review of  reinsurance contribution amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Audits. HHS or its designee may audit a contributing entity to  assess its compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
