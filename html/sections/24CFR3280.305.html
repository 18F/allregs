Each manufactured home shall be designed and  constructed as a completely integrated structure capable of sustaining  the design load requirements of this standard, and shall be capable of  transmitting these loads to stabilizing devices without exceeding the  allowable stresses or deflections. Roof framing shall be securely  fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor structure  to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and  chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as  imposed by design loads in this part. Uncompressed finished flooring  greater than \1/8\ inch in thickness shall not extend beneath load- bearing walls that are fastened to the floor structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Design loads--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Design dead loads.

The design live loads and wind and snow loads  shall be as specified in this section and shall be considered to be  uniformly distributed. The roof live load or snow load shall not be  considered as acting simultaneously with the wind load and the roof live  or snow load and floor live loads shall not be considered as resisting  the overturning moment due to wind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When engineering calculations are performed, allowable unit  stresses may be increased as provided in the documents referenced in  Sec. 3280.304 except as otherwise indicated in Sec.

The vertical edges of  penetrations for plumbing shall be covered with a moisture-resistant  adhesive or sealant. The vertical penetrations located under the bottom  plates of perimeter walls of rooms, areas, or compartments are not  required to be sealed; this does not include walls or partitions within  the rooms or areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wood panel products used as floor or subfloor materials on the  exterior of the home, such as in recessed entryways, must be rated for  exterior exposure and protected from moisture by sealing or applying  nonabsorbent overlay with water resistant adhesive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carpet or carpet pads shall not be installed under concealed  spaces subject to excessive moisture, such as plumbing fixture spaces,  floor areas under installed laundry equipment.
