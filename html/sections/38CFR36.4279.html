                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit risk(s), as  determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's (s')  creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s) on  the debtor(s), the terms of repayment of any loan may, by written  agreement between the holder and debtor(s), be extended in the event of  default, to avoid imminent default, or in any other case where the prior  approval of the Secretary is obtained. Except with the prior approval of  the Secretary, no such extension shall set a rate of amortization less  than that sufficient to fully amortize at least 80 percent of the loan  balance so extended within the maximum maturity prescribed for loans of  its class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of a partial prepayment pursuant to Sec. 36.4211,  the balance of the indebtedness may, by written agreement between the  holder and the debtor(s), be reamortized, provided the reamortization  schedule will result in full repayment of the loan within the original  maturity, and provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit   risk(s), as determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's  (s') creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s)  on the debtor(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless the prior approval of the Secretary has been obtained,  any extension or reamortization agreed to by a holder which relieves any  obligor from liability will release the liability of the Secretary under  the guaranty on the entire loan. However, if such release of liability  of an obligor results through operation of law by reason of an extension  or other act of forbearance, the liability of the Secretary as guarantor  will not be affected thereby, Provided, The required lien is maintained  and the title holder is and will remain liable for the payment of the  indebtedness: And further provided, That if such extension or act of  forbearance will result in the release of the veteran, all delinquent  installments, plus any foreclosure expenses which may have been  incurred, shall have been fully paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The holder shall promptly forward to the Secretary an advice of  the terms of any agreement effecting a reamortization or extension of a  guaranteed loan, together with cop(y)(ies) of the credit report(s)  obtained on the debtor(s).
