                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who will be sent a statement. Unless one of the conditions in  paragraph (b) of this section applies to you, we will send you, without  request, a statement of earnings and benefit estimates if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have a social security account number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You have wages or net earnings from self-employment on your  social security record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We can determine your current mailing address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who will not be sent a statement. We will not send you an  unrequested statement if any of the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You do not meet one or more of the conditions of paragraph (a)  of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Our records contain a notation of your death;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are entitled to benefits under title II of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We have already sent you a statement, based on your request, in  the fiscal year we selected you to receive an unrequested statement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We cannot obtain your address (see paragraph (c)(2) of this  section); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> We are correcting your social security earnings record when we  select you to receive a statement of earnings and benefit estimates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The selection and mailing process. Subject to the provisions of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, we will use the following  process for sending statements without requests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Selection. We will use our records of assigned social security  account numbers to identify individuals to whom we will send statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Addresses. If you are living in one of the 50 States or the  District of Columbia, our current procedure is to get your address from  individual taxpayer files of the Internal Revenue Service, as authorized  by section 6103(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.  6103(m)(7)). If you live in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam, we  will get your address from the taxpayer records of the place in which  you live.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Age. If you have attained age 60 on or before September 30,  1995, we will send you a statement by that date. If you attain age 60 on  or after October 1, 1995 but no later than September 30, 1999, we will  send you a statement in the fiscal year in which you attain age 60, or  in an earlier year as resources allow. Also, we will inform you that an  annually updated statement is available on request. Beginning October 1,  1999, we will send you a statement each year in which you are age 25 or  older.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ineligible. If we do not send you a statement because one or  more conditions in paragraph (b) of this section apply when you are  selected, we will send a statement in the first appropriate fiscal year  thereafter in which you do qualify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Undeliverable. If the statement we send you is returned by the  Post Office as undeliverable, we will not remail it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of statement of earnings and benefit estimates. To  prepare your statement and estimate your benefits, we will use the  earnings in our records. If there are earnings recorded for you in  either of the two years before the year in which you are selected to get  a statement, we will use the later of these earnings as your earnings  for the current year and future years when we estimate your benefits. In  addition, if you do not already have the required credits (quarters of  coverage) to be eligible to receive benefits, we will use that last  recorded earnings amount to estimate up to eight additional credits  (four per year) for last year and the current year if they are not yet  entered on your record. If there are no earnings entered on your record  in either of the two years preceding the year of selection, we will not  estimate current and future earnings or additional credits for you. Your  earnings and benefit estimates statement will contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your social security taxed earnings as shown by our records as  of the date we select you to receive a statement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An estimate of the social security and medicare hospital  insurance taxes paid on your earnings (although we do not maintain such  tax information);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of credits, i.e., quarters of coverage, not exceeding  40 (as described in paragraph (d) of this section), that you have for  both social security and medicare hospital insurance purposes, and the  number you need to be eligible for social security benefits and also for  medicare hospital insurance coverage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement as to whether you meet the credit (quarters of  coverage) requirements, as described in subpart B of this part, for each  type of social security benefit when we prepare the benefit estimates,  and also whether you are eligible for medicare hospital insurance  coverage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Estimates of the monthly retirement (old-age), disability,  dependents' and survivors' insurance benefits potentially payable on  your record if you meet the credits (quarters of coverage) requirements.  If you are age 50 or older, the estimates will include the retirement  (old-age) insurance benefits you could receive at age 62 (or your  current age if you are already over age 62), at full retirement age  (currently age 65 to 67, depending on your year of birth) or at your  current age if you are already over full retirement age, and at age 70.  If you are under age 50, instead of estimates, we may provide a general  description of the benefits (including auxiliary benefits) that are  available upon retirement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of the coverage provided under the medicare  program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A reminder of your right to request a correction of your  earnings record; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A remark that an annually updated statement is available on  request.
