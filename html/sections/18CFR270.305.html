A jurisdictional agency determination designating a portion of a formation as a tight formation must be made in the form and manner prescribed in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Guidelines for designating tight formations. A jurisdictional agency determination designating a portion of a formation as a tight formation must be made in accordance with the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the estimated in situ gas permeability, throughout the pay section, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. The expected in situ permeability is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known permeabilities obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the stabilized production rate of natural gas, against atmospheric pressure, of wells completed for production in such portion of such formation, without stimulation, is not expected to exceed the production rate determined in accordance with the table in this paragraph (b)(2). Such expected stabilized, pre-stimulation production rate is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known stabilized, pre-stimulation production rates obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.
