Selection  for occupancy of a project or unit is the function of the Section 8  owner. However, selection is subject to the income-eligibility and  income-targeting requirements in Sec. 5.653.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tenant selection plan. The owner must adopt a written tenant  selection plan in accordance with HUD requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of income. The owner may not select a family for  occupancy of a project or unit in an order different from the order on  the owner's waiting list for the purpose of selecting a relatively  higher income family. However, an owner may select a family for  occupancy of a project or unit based on its income in order to satisfy  the targeting requirements of Sec. 5.653(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Selection for particular unit. In selecting a family to occupy a  particular unit, the owner may match family characteristics with the  type of unit available, for example, number of bedrooms. If a unit has  special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the owner  must first offer the unit to families which include persons with  disabilities who require such features (see Sec. Sec. 8.27 and 100.202  of this title).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Housing assistance limitation for single persons. A single  person who is not an elderly or displaced person, a person with  disabilities, or the remaining member of a resident family may not be  provided a housing unit with two or more bedrooms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Particular owner preferences. The owner must inform all  applicants about available preferences and must give applicants an  opportunity to show that they qualify for available preferences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Residency requirements or preferences. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Residency  requirements are   prohibited. Although the owner is not prohibited from adopting a  residency preference, the owner may only adopt or implement residency  preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity  requirements listed at Sec. 5.105(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons  who reside in a specified geographic area (``residency preference  area'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An owner's residency preference must be approved by HUD in one  of the following methods:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Prior approval of the housing market area in the Affirmative  Fair Housing Marketing plan (in accordance with Sec. 108.25 of this  title) as a residency preference area;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Prior approval of the residency preference area in the PHA plan  of the jurisdiction in which the project is located;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Modification of the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, in  accordance with Sec. 108.25 of this title,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use of a residency preference may not have the purpose or  effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to a project or unit  based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability,  or age of any member of an applicant family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A residency preference must not be based on how long an  applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they  are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as  residents of the residency preference area. The owner may treat  graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs  in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference  area if the education or training program is designed to prepare  individuals for the job market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preference for working families. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner may adopt a  preference for admission of working families (families where the head,  spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given  the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or  sole member, is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the owner adopts a preference for admission of working  families, the owner must not give a preference based on the amount of  earned income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preference for person with disabilities. The owner may adopt a  preference for admission of families that include a person with  disabilities. However, the owner may not adopt a preference for  admission of persons with a specific disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Preference for victims of domestic violence. The owner should  consider whether to adopt a preference for admission of families that  include victims of domestic violence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced,  homeless or persons with disabilities over other single persons. The  owner may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age  62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over  other single persons.
