The State agency  shall publish the formula for review and comment by older persons, other  appropriate agencies and organizations and the general public. The  formula shall reflect the proportion among the planning and service  areas of persons age 60 and over in greatest economic or social need  with particular attention to low-income minority individuals. The State  agency shall review and update its formula as often as a new State plan  is submitted for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The intrastate funding formula shall provide for a separate  allocation of funds received under section 303(f) for preventive health  services. In the award of such funds to selected planning and service  areas, the State agency shall give priority to areas of the State:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which are medically underserved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In which there are large numbers of individuals who have the  greatest economic and social need for such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State agency shall submit its intrastate formula to the  Commissioner for review and comment. The intrastate formula shall be  submitted separately from the State plan.</p>
