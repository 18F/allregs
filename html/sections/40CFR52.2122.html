The two provisions vacated from the federal rules pertain to Pollution Control Projects (PCPs) and clean units. The PCP and clean unit references are severable from the remainder of the

NNSR program. Specifically, the following sections of South Carolina Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7.1 are being disapproved: (b)(5); (b)(6)--Second sentence only; (b)(8); (c)(4); (c)(6)(C)(viii); (c)(8)(C)(iii); (c)(8)(E)(v); (c)(10); (d)(1)(C)(ix); (d)(1)(C)(x); (d)(3)--Only the reference to the term ``clean unit'' is being disapproved.
