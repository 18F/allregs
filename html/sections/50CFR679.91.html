The amount of CQ for BSAI Atka mackerel that is assigned to each Amendment 80 cooperative in each management area is determined by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determine the amount of non-mackerel ITAC in each management area using the following equation:
Non-mackerel ITAC in a management area = (Amendment 80 non-mackerel QS units designated for that management area/Total Atka mackerel QS pool) x Amendment 80 sector ITAC in all management areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determine the amount of mackerel ITAC in each management area using the following equation:
Mackerel ITAC in a management area = Amendment 80 sector ITAC in that management area - Non-mackerel ITAC in that management area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determine the amount of non-mackerel CQ assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative using the following equation:
Non-mackerel CQ assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative = (Amendment 80 non-mackerel QS units designated for that management area assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative/Amendment 80 non-mackerel QS pool in that management area) x Non-mackerel ITAC for that management area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determine the amount of mackerel CQ assigned to the Amendment 80 cooperative using the following equation:
Mackerel CQ in a management area = (Mackerel QS units assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative/Mackerel QS pool) x Mackerel ITAC in that management area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total amount of Atka mackerel CQ assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative for a management area is equal to the sum of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(C) and (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amendment 80 limited access fishery. The amount of ITAC in a management area for each Amendment 80 species assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the Amendment 80 sector ITAC remaining after subtracting all CQ issued to all Amendment 80 cooperatives for that Amendment 80 species in that management area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocations of halibut PSC--(1) Amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector. The amount of halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector for each calendar year is specified in Table 35 to this part. That amount of halibut PSC is then assigned to Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative. For each calendar year, the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned as CQ to an Amendment 80 cooperative is determined by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiply the amount of halibut PSC established in Table 35 to this part by the percentage of the Amendment 80 halibut PSC apportioned to each Amendment 80 species as established in Table 36 to this part. This yields the halibut PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each Amendment 80 species, divide the amount of Amendment 80 QS units assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative by the Amendment 80 QS pool. This yields the percentage of Amendment 80 QS units held by that Amendment 80 cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each Amendment 80 species, multiply the halibut PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the percentage of the Amendment 80 QS pool assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative for that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. This yields the amount of halibut PSC apportioned to that cooperative for that Amendment 80 species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each Amendment 80 cooperative, sum the results of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section for all Amendment 80 species. This yields the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative as CQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. The amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the amount of halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector specified in Table 35 to this part subtracting the amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned as CQ to all Amendment 80 cooperatives as determined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of Amendment 80 halibut PSC in the Amendment 80 sector--(i) Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to a Amendment 80 cooperative. An amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC is assigned to the CQ permit issued to an Amendment 80 cooperative for use while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any halibut PSC used by an Amendment 80 cooperative must be deducted from the amount of halibut PSC CQ on its CQ permit. Amendment 80 halibut PSC on a CQ permit may only

be used by the members of the Amendment 80 cooperative to which it is assigned. Halibut PSC assigned as CQ is not subject to seasonal apportionment under Sec. 679.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. An amount of Amendment 80 halibut PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for use by all Amendment 80 vessels in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any halibut PSC used by Amendment 80 vessels assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery must be deducted from the amount of halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is subject to seasonal apportionment under Sec. 679.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector. Halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector for groundfish fishing in the BSAI may only be used by the members of the BSAI trawl limited access sector unless modified by reallocation to Amendment 80 cooperatives according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. Halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is subject to seasonal apportionment under Sec. 679.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allocations of crab PSC--(1) Amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector. The amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector for each Amendment 80 crab PSC in a calendar year is specified in Table 35 to this part. That amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is then assigned to Amendment 80 cooperatives and the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative. For each calendar year, for each Amendment 80 crab PSC, the amount assigned as CQ to an Amendment 80 cooperative is determined by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiply the amount of an Amendment 80 crab PSC established in Table 35 to this part by the percentage of the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportioned to each Amendment 80 species as established in Table 36 to this part. This yields the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportionment for that Amendment 80 species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each Amendment 80 species, divide the amount of Amendment 80 QS units assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative by the Amendment 80 QS pool. This yields the percentage of Amendment 80 QS units held by that Amendment 80 cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each Amendment 80 species, multiply the Amendment 80 crab PSC apportionment to that Amendment 80 species established in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section by the percentage of the Amendment 80 QS pool held by an Amendment 80 cooperative as established in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. This yields the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC apportioned to that Amendment 80 cooperative for that Amendment 80 species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each Amendment 80 crab PSC, sum the results of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) for all Amendment 80 species. This yields the amount of that Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. The amount of each Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery is equal to the amount of that Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 sector specified in Table 35 to this part subtracting the amount of that crab PSC that has been assigned as CQ to all Amendment 80 cooperatives as determined in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of Amendment 80 crab PSC in the Amendment 80 sector--(i) Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to an Amendment 80 cooperative. An amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is assigned to the CQ permit issued to an Amendment 80 cooperative for use while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any Amendment 80 crab PSC used by an Amendment 80 cooperative must be deducted from the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC CQ on its CQ permit. Amendment 80 crab PSC on a

CQ permit may only be used by the members of the Amendment 80 cooperative to which it is assigned. Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned as CQ is not subject to seasonal apportionment under Sec. 679.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amendment 80 halibut PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. An amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC is assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery for use by all Amendment 80 vessels in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery while fishing for all groundfish species in the BSAI or adjacent waters open by the State of Alaska for which it adopts a Federal fishing season. Any Amendment 80 crab PSC used by Amendment 80 vessels assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery must be deducted from the amount of Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the Amendment 80 limited access fishery.

Amendment 80 crab PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is subject to seasonal apportionment under Sec. 679.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rollover--Annual reallocation of an Amendment 80 species ICA or ITAC, crab PSC, and halibut PSC from the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives--(1) General. The Regional Administrator may reallocate a portion of an ICA or ITAC of an Amendment 80 species, crab PSC, or halibut PSC amount assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives if the amount assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector is projected not to be harvested or used. Any reallocation will result in an amended CQ permit for each Amendment 80 cooperative. The timing of a reallocation will be at the discretion of the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Factors considered. The Regional Administrator may consider the following factors when reallocating an ICA, a directed fishing allowance of an Amendment 80 species, or crab PSC, or halibut PSC amounts from the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The risk of biological harm to a groundfish species or species group;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The risk of socioeconomic harm to other domestic fishery participants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The impact that the allocation might have on the socioeconomic well-being of Amendment 80 cooperatives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Current catch and PSC use in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Historic catch and PSC use in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Harvest capacity and any stated intent on the future harvesting patterns of vessels in the BSAI trawl limited access sector;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Administrative requirements to reissue CQ permits; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any other relevant biological, socioeconomic, or administrative factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rollover of Amendment 80 species. If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a reallocation of a portion of the ITAC or ICA of an Amendment 80 species assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to Amendment 80 cooperatives is appropriate, the Regional Administrator will issue a revised CQ permit to reallocate that amount of Amendment 80 species to each Amendment 80 cooperative according to the following formula:
Amount of additional CQ issued to an Amendment 80 cooperative = Amount of Amendment 80 species available for reallocation to Amendment 80 cooperatives x (Amount of CQ for that Amendment 80 species initially assigned to that Amendment 80 cooperative / [Sigma] CQ for that Amendment 80 species initially assigned to all Amendment 80 cooperatives).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rollover of halibut PSC.
