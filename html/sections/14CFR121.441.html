If a pilot proficiency check is conducted in  accordance with this paragraph, the next required proficiency check for  that pilot must be conducted in the same manner, or in accordance with  appendix F of this part, or a course of training in an airplane visual  simulator under Sec. 121.409 may be substituted therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deviation authority based upon designation of related aircraft  in accordance with Sec. 121.418(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section based  upon a designation of related aircraft in accordance with Sec.  121.418(b) of this part and a determination that the certificate holder  can demonstrate an equivalent level of safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for deviation from paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this  section must be submitted to the Administrator.
