When testing or adjusting an energized circuit a rubber mat, duck board, or other suitable insulation shall be used underfoot where an insulated deck does not exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> De-energizing the circuit shall be accomplished by opening the circuit breaker, opening the switch, or removing the fuse, whichever method is appropriate. The circuit breaker, switch, or fuse location shall then be locked out or tagged in accordance with Sec. 1915.89.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When work is performed immediately adjacent to an open-front energized board or in back of an energized board, the board shall be covered or some other equally safe means shall be used to prevent contact with any of the energized parts.
