The symbol for DNL is Ldn.</p><p class="depth0">Noise exposure map means a scaled, geographic depiction of an airport, its noise contours, and surrounding area developed in accordance with section A150.1 of Appendix A of this part, including the accompanying documentation setting forth the required descriptions of forecast aircraft operations at that airport during the fifth calendar year (or later) beginning after submission of the map, together with the ways, if any, those operations will affect the map (including noise contours and the forecast land uses).</p><p class="depth0">Noise level reduction (NLR) means the amount of noise level reduction in decibels achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation (between outdoor and indoor levels) in the design and construction of a structure.</p><p class="depth0">Noncompatible land use means the use of land that is identified under this part as normally not compatible with the outdoor noise environment (or an adequately attenuated noise reduction level for the indoor activities involved at the location) because the yearly day-night average sound level is above that identified for that or similar use under appendix A (Table 1) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Regional Airports Division Manager means the Airports Division Manager having responsibility for the geographic area in which the airport in question is located.</p><p class="depth0">Restriction affecting flight procedures means any requirement, limitation, or other action affecting the operation of aircraft, in the air or on the ground.</p><p class="depth0">Sound exposure level means the level, in decibels, of the time integral of squared A-weighted sound pressure during a specified period or event, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20

micropascals and a duration of one second.</p><p class="depth0">Yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) means the 365-day average, in decibels, day-night average sound level. The symbol for YDNL is also Ldn.
