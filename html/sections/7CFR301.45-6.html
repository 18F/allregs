                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or  moving regulated articles may enter into a compliance agreement to  facilitate the movement of such articles under this subpart. Qualified  certified applicators must enter into compliance agreements, in  accordance with the definition of qualified certified applicator in  Sec. 301.45-1. A compliance agreement shall specify safeguards  necessary to prevent spread of the gypsy moth, such as disinfestation  practices or application of chemical materials in accordance with the  treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter. Compliance agreement  forms may be obtained from the Administrator or an inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is  supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the  inspector finds that such person has failed to comply with the  conditions of the agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision  and the reasons therefore shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as  circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been  canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within  ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation.  The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the  person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully  canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing,  stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances  permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall  be held   to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing  will be adopted by the Administrator.
