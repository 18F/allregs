                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Any personnel or employment record made or  kept by the contractor shall be preserved by the contractor for a period  of not less than two years from the date of the making of the record or  the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. However, if the  contractor has fewer than 150 employees or does not have a Government  contract of at least $150,000, the minimum record retention period shall  be one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel  action involved, whichever occurs later. Such records include, but are  not necessarily limited to, records pertaining to hiring, assignment,  promotion, demotion, transfer, lay off or termination, rates of pay or  other terms of compensation, and selection for training or  apprenticeship, and other records having to do with requests for  reasonable accommodation, the results of any physical examination, job  advertisements and postings, applications, resumes, and any and all  expressions of interest through the Internet or related electronic data  technologies as to which the contractor considered the individual for a  particular position, such as on-line resumes or internal resume  databases, records identifying job seekers contacted regarding their  interest in a particular position (for purposes of recordkeeping with  respect to internal resume databases, the contractor must maintain a  record of each resume added to the database, a record of the date each  resume was added to the database, the position for which each search of  the database was made, and corresponding to each search, the substantive  search criteria used and the date of the search; for purposes of  recordkeeping with respect to external resume databases, the contractor  must maintain a record of the position for which each search of the  database was made, and corresponding to each search, the substantive  search criteria used, the date of the search, and the resumes of job  seekers who met the basic qualifications for the particular position who  are considered by the contractor), regardless of whether the individual  qualifies as an Internet Applicant under 41 CFR 60-1.3, tests and test  results, and interview notes. The term ``personnel records relevant to  the complaint,'' for example, would include personnel or employment  records relating to the complainant and to all other employees holding  positions similar to that held or sought by the complainant and  application forms or test papers submitted by unsuccessful applicants  and by all other candidates for the same position as that for which the  complainant unsuccessfully applied. Where a compliance evaluation has  been initiated, all personnel and employment records described above are  relevant until OFCCP makes a final disposition of the evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Affirmative action programs. A contractor establishment required  under Sec. 60-1.40 to develop and maintain a written affirmative action  program (AAP) must maintain its current AAP and documentation of good  faith effort,   and must preserve its AAP and documentation of good faith effort for the  immediately preceding AAP year, unless it was not then covered by the  AAP requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor identification of record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any record the  contractor maintains pursuant to this section, the contractor must be  able to identify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gender, race, and ethnicity of each employee; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where possible, the gender, race, and ethnicity of each  applicant or Internet Applicant as defined in 41 CFR 60-1.3, whichever  is applicable to the particular position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contractor must supply this information to the Office of  Federal Contract Compliance Programs upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adverse impact evaluations. When evaluating whether a contractor  has maintained information on impact and conducted an adverse impact  analysis under part 60-3 with respect to Internet hiring procedures,  OFCCP will require only those records relating to the analyses of the  impact of employee selection procedures on Internet Applicants, as  defined in 41 CFR 60-1.3, and those records relating to the analyses of  the impact of employment tests that are used as employee selection  procedures, without regard to whether the tests were administered to  Internet Applicants, as defined in 41 CFR 60-1.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to preserve records. Failure to preserve complete and  accurate records as required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this  section constitutes noncompliance with the contractor's obligations  under the Executive Order and this part. Where the contractor has  destroyed or failed to preserve records as required by this section,  there may be a presumption that the information destroyed or not  preserved would have been unfavorable to the contractor: Provided, That  this presumption shall not apply where the contractor shows that the  destruction or failure to preserve records results from the  circumstances that are outside of the contractor's control.
