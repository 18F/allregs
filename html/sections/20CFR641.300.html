                            <p class="depth0">The State Plan is a plan, submitted by the Governor, or the highest  government official, in each State, as an independent document or as  part of the WIA Unified Plan, that outlines a four-year strategy for the  statewide provision of community service employment and other authorized  activities for eligible individuals under the SCSEP as described in  Sec. 641.302. The State Plan also describes the planning and  implementation process for SCSEP services in the State, taking into  account the relative distribution of eligible individuals and employment  opportunities within the State. The State Plan is intended to foster  coordination among the various SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients  operating within the State and to facilitate the efforts of  stakeholders, including State and local boards under WIA, to work  collaboratively through a participatory process to accomplish the  SCSEP's goals. (OAA Sec. 503(a)(1)). The State Plan provisions are  listed in Sec. 641.325.</p>
