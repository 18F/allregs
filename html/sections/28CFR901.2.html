The requirement for the submission of fingerprints may be satisfied in two ways:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fingerprints should be submitted contemporaneously with the request for criminal history information, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes approved by the Compact Council, a delayed submission of fingerprints may be permissible under exigent circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A preliminary III name based check may be made pending the receipt of the delayed submission of the fingerprints. The state repository may authorize terminal access to authorized agencies designated by the state, to enable them to conduct such checks. Such access must be made pursuant to the security policy set forth by the state's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Systems Agency (formerly known as the Control Terminal Agency).</p>
