                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS.  The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the  option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that  cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that  expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such audit  period, provided that each such audit must encompass the financial  statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such  department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be  considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and  schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial statements. The auditor must determine whether the  financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material  respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of  Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to  the auditee's financial statements as a whole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Internal control. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The compliance supplement provides  guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the  guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal  Control--Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must  perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over  Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed  level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the  auditor must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major  programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for the  assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major  program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph  (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When internal control over some or all of the compliance  requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in  preventing or detecting   noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance  requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency  or material weakness in accordance with Sec. 75.516, assess the related  control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance  tests are required because of ineffective internal control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the  auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal  statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards  that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major  programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal  programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs  are included in the compliance supplement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs  contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance  requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have  been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not  reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the  current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures  accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance  supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance  for programs not included in the supplement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and  such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor  sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on  compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Audit follow-up. The auditor must follow-up on prior audit  findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary  schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance  with Sec. 75.511(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when  the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings  materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The  auditor must perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a  prior audit finding relates to a major program in the current year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data collection form. As required in Sec. 75.512(b)(3), the  auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection  form.</p>
