                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payments. The agreement must provide that recognition payments can only be made to individuals who are receiving SVB payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative costs--(1) General rule. SSA will assess each State that elects Federal administration of its recognition payments an administration fee for administering those payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. SSA will assess each State that elects Federal administration of its recognition payments an administration fee for administering those payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining the administration fee. The administration fee is assessed and paid monthly and is derived by multiplying the number of State recognition payments we make on behalf of a State for any month in a fiscal year by the applicable dollar rate for the fiscal year. The number of recognition payments we make in a month is the total number of checks we issue, and direct deposits we make, to recipients in that month, that are composed in whole or in part of State recognition funds. The dollar amounts are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For fiscal year 2001, $8.10;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For fiscal year 2002, $8.50; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The applicable rate in the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year of the increase exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the increase, and rounded to the nearest whole cent; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A different rate if the Commissioner determines the different rate is appropriate for the State considering the complexity of administering the State's recognition payment program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agreement period. The agreement period for a State that has elected Federal administration of its recognition payments extends for one year from the date the agreement was signed unless otherwise designated in the agreement. The agreement will be automatically renewed for a period of one year unless either the State or SSA gives written notice not to renew, at least 90 days before the beginning of the new period. For a State to elect Federal administration of its recognition payment program, it must notify SSA of its intent to enter into an agreement, furnishing the necessary payment specifications, at least 120 days before the first day of the month for which it wishes Federal administration to

begin, and have executed such agreement at least 30 days before such day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification or termination. The agreement may be modified at any time by mutual consent. The State or SSA may terminate the agreement upon 90 days' written notice to the other party, provided the effective date of the termination is the last day of a quarter. However, the State may terminate the agreement upon 45 days written notice to SSA if: (1) The State does not wish to comply with a regulation promulgated by SSA after the execution of the agreement; and (2) the State provides its written notice within 30 days of the effective date of the regulation. The Commissioner is not precluded from terminating the agreement in less than 90 days if the State has failed to materially comply with the provisions of Sec. 408.1235 on State transfer of funds to SSA.</p>
