                            <p class="depth0">This Standard is effective as of April 17, 1992. Contractors with  prior CAS-covered contracts with full coverage shall continue this  Standard's applicability upon receipt of a contract to which this  Standard is applicable. For contractors with no previous contracts  subject to this Standard, this Standard shall be applied beginning with  the contractor's next full fiscal year beginning after the receipt of a  contract to which this Standard is applicable.  Appendix A to 9904.410--Transition From a Cost of Sales or Sales Base to</p><p class="depth0">a Cost Input Base</p><p class="depth0">A business unit may use the method described below for transition  from the use of a cost of sales or sales base to a cost input base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the cost of sales or sales base in accordance with the  cost accounting practice disclosed or established prior to the date  established by 9904.410-80(b) of the original Cost Accounting Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Calculate the G&A; expense allocation rate using the base  determined in subparagraph (1) of this appendix and use that rate to  allocate from the G&A; expense pool to the final cost objectives which  were in existence prior to the date on which the business unit must  first allocate costs in accordance with the requirements of this Cost  Accounting Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Calculate a cost input base in compliance with 9904.410-50(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the G&A; expense rate using the base determined in  subparagraph (3) of this appendix and use that rate to allocate from the  G&A; expense pool to those final cost objectives which arise under  contracts entered into on or after the date on which the business unit  must first allocate costs in accordance with the requirements of this  Cost Accounting Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The calculations set forth in subparagraphs (1)-(4) of this  appendix shall be performed for each cost accounting period during which  final cost objectives described in (2) are being performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> The business unit shall establish an inventory suspense account.

Business Unit R has been using a cost of sales base to allocate  its G&A; expense pool to final cost objectives. Unit R uses a calendar  year as its cost accounting period. On October 1, 1976 (assumed for  purposes of this illustration) Cost Accounting Standard 410 becomes  effective. On October 2, 1976, Unit R receives a 3-year contract  containing the Cost Accounting Standards clause. As a result, Unit R  must comply with the requirements of the Standard in the cost accounting  period beginning in January 1978. As of January 3, 1978, Business Unit R  has the following contracts:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Contract I--A 4-year contract awarded in January 1975.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Contract II--A 3-year contract which was negotiated in March  1976, and was awarded on October 2, 1976.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Contract III--A 4-year contract awarded on January 2, 1978.</p><p class="depth2">If Business Unit R chooses to use the transition method provided in  9904.410-50(e), it will allocate the G&A; expense pool to these contracts  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(a)</em> Contract I--Since Contract I was in existence prior to January  1, 1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to it using a cost of  sales base as provided in 9904.410-50(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(b)</em> Contract II--Since this contract was in existence prior to  January 1, 1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to it using a  cost of sales base as provided in 9904.410-50(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(c)</em> Contract III--Since this contract was awarded after January 1,  1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to this contract using a  cost input base.</p><p class="depth0">Having chosen to use 9904.410-50(e), Business Unit R will use the  transition method of allocating the G&A; expense pool to final cost  objectives until all contracts awarded prior to January 1, 1978, are  completed (1979 if the contracts are completed on schedule). Beginning  with the cost accounting period subsequent to that time, 1980, Unit R  will use a cost input base to allocate the G&A; expense pool to all cost  objectives. Unit R will also carry forward an inventory suspense account  in accordance with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0">2.A. Business Unit N is first required to allocate its costs in  accordance with the requirements of 9904.410 during the fiscal year  beginning January 1, 1978.
