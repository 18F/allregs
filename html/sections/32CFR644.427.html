Notices are not required for property having an estimated fair market value of less than $1,000, except where the disposal agency has reason to believe that an eligible public agency may be interested in the property. Notices as provided in this section will be given for all surplus airport property and surplus fee-owned land for which the Army is the disposal agency, that is classified for disposal under a special act, or if there is reason to believe that a public agency may be interested in acquiring the land by negotiation at its appraised fair market value under the Federal Property Act (40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3)(H).</p>
