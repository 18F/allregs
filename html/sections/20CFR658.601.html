                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each State agency shall establish and maintain a self-appraisal system for job service operations to determine success in reaching goals and to correct deficiencies in performance. The self-appraisal system shall include numerical (quantitative) appraisal and non-numerical (qualitative) appraisal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Numerical appraisal at the local office level shall be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performance shall be measured on a quarterly-basis against planned service levels as stated in the State Program and Budget Plan (PBP). The State plan shall be consistent with numerical goals contained in local office plans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To appraise numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on the Employment Security Automated Reporting System (ESARS) tables and Cost Accounting Reports shall be compared to planned levels. Variances between achievement and plan shall be identified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the numerical appraisal of required activities/indicators identifies significant variances from planned levels, additional analysis shall be conducted to isolate possible contributing factors. This data analysis shall include, as appropriate, comparisons to past performance, attainment of PBP goals and consideration of pertinent non-numerical factors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Results of local office numerical reviews shall be documented and significant deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan as described in paragraph (a)(6) shall be developed to address these deficiencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The result of local office appraisal, including corrective action plans, shall be communicated in writing to the next higher level of authority for review.

When this review is conducted at an area or district office, a report describing local office performance within the area or district jurisdiction shall be communicated to the central office on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Numerical appraisal at the central office level shall be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performance shall be measured on a quarterly basis against planned service levels as stated in the State Program and Budget Plan (PBP). The State plan shall be consistent with numerical goals contained in local office plans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To appraise these key numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on the Employment Security Automated Reporting System (ESARS) tables and Cost Accounting Reports shall be compared to planned levels. Variances between achievement and plan shall be identified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The central office shall review Statewide data, and performance against planned service levels as stated in the State Program and Budget Plan (PBP) on at least a quarterly basis to identify significant Statewide deficiencies and to determine the need for additional analysis, including identification of trends, comparisons to past performance, and attainment of PBP goals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Results of numerical reviews shall be documented and significant deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall be developed to address these deficiencies. These plans shall be submitted to the ETA

A corrective action plan that addresses these deficiencies as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall be developed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The result of local office nonnumerical appraisal, including corrective actions, shall be communicated in writing to the next higher level of authority for review. This review shall cover thoroughness and adequacy of local office appraisal, appropriateness of corrective actions, and need for higher level involvement. When this review is conducted at an area or district level, a report summarizing local office performance within that jurisdiction shall be communicated to the central office on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As part of its oversight responsibilities, the central office shall conduct onsite reviews in those local offices which show continuing internal problems or deficiencies in performance as indicated by such sources as data analysis, nonnumerical appraisal, or other sources of information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nonnumerical (qualitative) review of central office job service activities shall be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Central office operations shall be assessed annually to determine compliance with Federal regulations and to assess progress made on annually established work plans established for central office staff.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Results of nonnumerical reviews shall be documented and deficiencies identified.
