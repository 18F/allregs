                            <p class="depth0">It is deemed to be in the public interest for an adjudicating  official or the Board to impose disciplinary sanctions against any  practitioner who falls within one or more of the categories enumerated  in this section, but these categories do not constitute the exclusive  grounds for which disciplinary sanctions may be imposed in the public  interest. Nothing in this regulation should be read to denigrate the  practitioner's duty to represent zealously his or her client within the  bounds of the law. A practitioner who falls within one of the following  categories shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions in the public  interest if he or she:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Charges or receives, either directly or indirectly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an attorney, any fee or compensation for specific  services rendered for any person that shall be deemed to be grossly  excessive. The factors to be considered in determining whether a fee or  compensation is grossly excessive include the following: The time and  labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,  and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; the  likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the  particular employment will preclude other employment by the attorney;  the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;  the amount involved and the results obtained; the time limitations  imposed by the client or by the circumstances; the nature and length of  the professional relationship with the client; and the experience,  reputation, and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the  services,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an accredited representative as defined in Sec.  1292.1(a)(4) of this chapter, any fee or compensation for specific  services rendered for any person, except that an accredited  representative may be regularly compensated by the organization of which  he or she is an accredited representative, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a law student or law graduate as defined in Sec.  1292.1(a)(2) of this chapter, any fee or compensation for specific  services rendered for any person, except that a law student or law  graduate may be regularly compensated by the organization or firm with  which he or she is associated as long as he or she is appearing without  direct or indirect remuneration from the client he or she represents;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bribes, attempts to bribe, coerces, or attempts to coerce, by  any means whatsoever, any person (including a party to a case or an  officer or employee of the Department of Justice) to commit any act or  to refrain from performing any act in connection with any case;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Knowingly or with reckless disregard makes a false statement of  material fact or law, or willfully misleads, misinforms, threatens, or  deceives any person (including a party to a case or an officer or  employee of the Department of Justice), concerning any material and  relevant matter relating to a case, including knowingly or with reckless  disregard offering false evidence. If a practitioner has offered  material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the practitioner  shall take appropriate remedial measures;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Solicits professional employment, through in-person or live  telephone contact or through the use of runners, from a prospective  client with whom the practitioner has no family or prior professional  relationship, when a significant motive for the practitioner's doing so  is the practitioner's pecuniary gain. If the practitioner has no family  or prior professional relationship with the prospective client known to  be in need of legal services in a particular matter, the practitioner  must include the words ``Advertising Material'' on the outside of the  envelope of any written communication and at the beginning and ending of  any recorded communication. Such advertising material or similar  solicitation documents may not be distributed by any person in or around  the premises of any building in which an Immigration Court is located;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Is subject to a final order of disbarment or suspension, or has  resigned while a disciplinary investigation or proceeding is pending;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Knowingly or with reckless disregard makes a false or misleading  communication about his or her qualifications or services. A  communication is false or misleading if it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a  fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not  materially misleading, or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contains an assertion about the practitioner or his or her  qualifications or services that cannot be substantiated. A practitioner  shall not state or imply that he or she has been recognized or certified  as a specialist in immigration and/or nationality law unless such  certification is granted by the appropriate state regulatory authority  or by an organization that has been approved by the appropriate state  regulatory authority to grant such certification;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Engages in contumelious or otherwise obnoxious conduct, with  regard to a case in which he or she acts in a representative capacity,  which would constitute contempt of court in a judicial proceeding;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Has been found guilty of, or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere  to, a serious crime, in any court of the United States, or of any state,  possession, territory, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia. A  serious crime includes any felony and also includes any lesser crime, a  necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law  definition of such crime in the jurisdiction where the judgment was  entered, involves interference with the administration of justice, false  swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax  returns, deceit, dishonesty, bribery, extortion, misappropriation,  theft, or an attempt, or a conspiracy or solicitation of another, to  commit a serious crime. A plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction  after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the  meaning of this section;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Knowingly or with reckless disregard falsely certifies a copy of  a document as being a true and complete copy of an original;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Engages in frivolous behavior in a proceeding before an  Immigration Court, the Board, or any other administrative appellate body  under title II of the Immigration and Nationality Act, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A practitioner engages in frivolous behavior when he or she  knows or reasonably should have known that his or her actions lack an  arguable basis in law or in fact, or are taken for an improper purpose,  such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay. Actions that, if taken  improperly, may be subject to disciplinary sanctions include, but are  not limited to, the making of an argument on any factual or legal  question, the submission of an application for discretionary relief, the  filing of a motion, or the filing of an appeal. The signature of a  practitioner on any filing, application, motion, appeal, brief, or other  document constitutes certification by the signer that the signer has  read the filing, application, motion, appeal, brief, or other document  and that, to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and  belief, formed after inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, the  document is well-grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or by  a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of  existing law or the establishment of new law, and is not interposed for  any improper purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The imposition of disciplinary sanctions for frivolous behavior  under this section in no way limits the authority of the Board to  dismiss an appeal summarily pursuant to Sec. 1003.1(d);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Engages in conduct that constitutes ineffective assistance of  counsel, as previously determined in a finding by the Board, an  immigration judge in an immigration proceeding, or a Federal court judge  or panel, and a disciplinary complaint is filed within one year of the  finding;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Repeatedly fails to appear for pre-hearing conferences,  scheduled hearings, or case-related meetings in a timely manner without  good cause;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Assists any person, other than a practitioner as defined in  Sec. 1003.101(b), in the performance of activity that constitutes the  unauthorized practice of law. The practice of law before EOIR means  engaging in practice or preparation as those terms are defined in  Sec. Sec. 1001.1(i) and (k);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Engages in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of  justice or undermines the integrity of the adjudicative process. Conduct  that will generally be subject to sanctions under this ground includes  any action or inaction that seriously impairs or interferes with the  adjudicative process when the practitioner should have reasonably known  to avoid such conduct;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Fails to provide competent representation to a client. Competent  representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and  preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. Competent  handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of  the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and  procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Fails to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives  of representation and fails to consult with   the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued, in  accordance with paragraph (r) of this section. A practitioner may take  such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry  out the representation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Fails to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in  representing a client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A practitioner's workload must be controlled and managed so that  each matter can be handled competently.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A practitioner has the duty to act with reasonable promptness.  This duty includes, but shall not be limited to, complying with all time  and filing limitations. This duty, however, does not preclude the  practitioner from agreeing to a reasonable request for a postponement  that will not prejudice the practitioner's client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A practitioner should carry through to conclusion all matters  undertaken for a client, consistent with the scope of representation as  previously determined by the client and practitioner, unless the client  terminates the relationship or the practitioner obtains permission to  withdraw in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. If a  practitioner has handled a proceeding that produced a result adverse to  the client and the practitioner and the client have not agreed that the  practitioner will handle the matter on appeal, the practitioner must  consult with the client about the client's appeal rights and the terms  and conditions of possible representation on appeal;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Fails to maintain communication with the client throughout the  duration of the client-practitioner relationship. It is the obligation  of the practitioner to take reasonable steps to communicate with the  client in a language that the client understands. A practitioner is only  under the obligation to attempt to communicate with his or her client  using addresses or phone numbers known to the practitioner. In order to  properly maintain communication, the practitioner should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly inform and consult with the client concerning any  decision or circumstance with respect to which the client's informed  consent is reasonably required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the  client's objectives are to be accomplished. Reasonable consultation with  the client includes the duty to meet with the client sufficiently in  advance of a hearing or other matter to ensure adequate preparation of  the client's case and compliance with applicable deadlines;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the  matter, such as significant developments affecting the timing or the  substance of the representation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, except  that when a prompt response is not feasible, the practitioner, or a  member of the practitioner's staff, should acknowledge receipt of the  request and advise the client when a response may be expected;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Fails to disclose to the adjudicator legal authority in the  controlling jurisdiction known to the practitioner to be directly  adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing  counsel;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Fails to submit a signed and completed Notice of Entry of  Appearance as Attorney or Representative in compliance with applicable  rules and regulations when the practitioner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has engaged in practice or preparation as those terms are  defined in Sec. Sec. 1001.1(i) and (k), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has been deemed to have engaged in a pattern or practice of  failing to submit such forms, in compliance with applicable rules and  regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in each case where the  respondent is represented, every pleading, application, motion, or other  filing shall be signed by the practitioner of record in his or her  individual name; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Repeatedly files notices, motions, briefs, or claims that  reflect little or no attention to the specific factual or legal issues  applicable to a client's case, but rather rely on boilerplate language  indicative of a substantial failure to competently and diligently  represent the client.
