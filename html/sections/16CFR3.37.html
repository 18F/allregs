                                Sec. 3.37  Production of documents, electronically stored information,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability; procedures for use. Any party may serve on another  party a request: to produce and permit the party making the request, or  someone acting on the party's behalf, to inspect and copy any designated  documents or electronically stored information, as   defined in Sec. 3.34(b), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any  tangible things which are within the scope of Sec. 3.31(c)(1) and in  the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request  is served; or to permit entry upon designated land or other property in  the possession or control of the party upon whom the order would be  served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying,  photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated  object or operation thereon, within the scope of Sec. 3.31(c)(1). Each  such request shall specify with reasonable particularity the documents  or things to be produced or inspected, or the property to be entered.  Each such request shall also specify a reasonable time, place, and  manner of making the production or inspection and performing the related  acts. Each request may specify the form in which electronically stored  information is to be produced, but the requested form of electronically  stored information must not be overly burdensome or unnecessarily costly  to the producing party. A party shall make documents available as they  are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label  them to correspond with the categories in the request. A person not a  party to the action may be compelled to produce documents and things or  to submit to an inspection as provided in Sec. 3.34. Except as provided  in Sec. 3.31(h), requests under this section shall not be filed with  the Office of the Secretary, the Administrative Law Judge, or otherwise  provided to the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Response; objections. No more than 30 days after receiving the  request, the response of the party upon whom the request is served shall  state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and  related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is  objected to, in which event the reasons for the objection shall be  stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part  shall be specified and inspection permitted of the remaining parts. The  response may state an objection to a requested form for producing  electronically stored information. If the responding party objects to a  requested form - or if no form was specified in the request - the party  must state the form it intends to use. The party submitting the request  may move for an order under Sec. 3.38(a) with respect to any objection  to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or  any failure to permit inspection as requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Production of documents or electronically stored information.  Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the Administrative Law Judge,  these procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A party must produce documents as they are kept in the usual  course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the  categories in the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> If a request does not specify a form for producing  electronically stored information, a party must produce it in a form in  which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> A party need not produce the same electronically stored  information in more than one form.
