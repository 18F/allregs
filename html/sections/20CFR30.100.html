                                Sec. 30.100  In general, how does an employee file an initial claim
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To claim benefits under EEOICPA, an employee must file a claim  in writing. Form EE-1 should be used for this purpose, but any written  communication that requests benefits under EEOICPA will be considered a  claim. It will, however, be necessary for an employee to submit a Form  EE-1 for OWCP to fully develop the claim. Copies of Form EE-1 may be  obtained from OWCP or on the Internet at http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/ compliance/owcp/eeoicp/main.htm. The employee's claim must be filed with  OWCP, but another person may do so on the employee's behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of these regulations). The employee may  withdraw his or her claim by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any  time before OWCP determines his or her eligibility for benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a claim is  considered to be ``filed'' on the date that the employee mails his or  her claim to OWCP, as determined by postmark, or on the date that the  claim is received by OWCP, whichever is the earliest determinable date.  However, in no event will a claim under Part B of EEOICPA be considered  to be ``filed'' earlier than July 31, 2001, nor will a claim under Part  E of EEOICPA be considered to be ``filed'' earlier than October 30,  2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee, or the person filing the claim on behalf of the  employee, shall affirm that the information provided on the Form EE-1 is  true, and must inform OWCP of any subsequent changes to that  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for a covered uranium employee filing a claim under Part  B of the Act, the employee is responsible for submitting with his or her  claim, or arranging for the submission of, medical evidence to OWCP that  establishes that he or she sustained an occupational illness and/or a  covered illness. This required medical evidence is described in Sec.  30.114 and does not refer to mere recitations of symptoms the employee  experienced that the employee believes indicate that he or she sustained  an occupational illness or a covered illness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For those claims under Part E of EEOICPA that were originally  filed with DOE as claims for assistance under former section 7385o of  EEOICPA (which was repealed on October 28, 2004), a claim is considered  to be ``filed'' on the date that the employee mailed his or her claim to  DOE, as determined by postmark, or on the date that the claim was  received by DOE, whichever is the earliest determinable date. However,  in no event will a claim referred to in this paragraph be considered to  be ``filed'' earlier than October 30, 2000.</p>
