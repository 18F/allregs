Sec.  50.1 and 56.101 of this chapter in which more than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or procedure that does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure that is not likely to contribute to the well-being of the subject, may involve children as subjects only if the IRB finds that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational situations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition that is of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' disorder or condition; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians as set forth in Sec.  50.55.
