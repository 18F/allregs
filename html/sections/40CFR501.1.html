                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, and 518(e) of the CWA, and implement  the requirements of those sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving,  revising, and withdrawing State sludge management programs under section  405(f), and the requirements State programs must meet to be approved by  the Administrator under section 405(f) of CWA. Sludge Management Program  submissions may be developed and implemented under any existing or new  State authority or authorities as long as they meet the requirements of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any complete State Sludge Management Program submitted for  approval under this part shall have the following as a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authority to require compliance by any person who uses or  disposes of sewage sludge with standards for sludge use or disposal  issued under section 405(d) of the CWA, including compliance by federal  facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The authority to issue permits that apply, and ensure compliance  with, the applicable requirements of section 405 of the Clean Water Act  to any POTW or other treatment works treating domestic sewage, and  procedures for issuance of such permits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provisions for regulating the use or disposal of sewage sludge  by non-permittees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The authority to take actions to protect public health and the  environment from any adverse effects that may occur from toxic  pollutants in sewage sludge; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The authority to abate violations of the State sludge program,  including civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of  enforcement. Indian Tribes can satisfy criminal enforcement authority  requirements under Sec. 501.25.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, any complete State Sludge Management Program  submitted for approval under this part must have authority to regulate  all sewage sludge management activities subject to 40 CFR part 503,  unless the State is applying for partial sludge program approval in  accordance with   paragraph (m) of this section. The State sludge management program must  include authority to regulate all Federal facilities in the State.  Sludge management activities must include as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Land application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Landfilling in a Municipal Solid Waste Landfill regulated under  40 CFR part 258;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Incineration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Surface disposal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other sludge use or disposal practices that may subsequently  be regulated by 40 CFR part 503.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator will approve State programs which conform to  the applicable requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator will  suspend the issuance of federal permits for those activities subject to  the approved State program. After program approval EPA will retain  jurisdiction over any permits (including general permits) which it has  issued unless arrangements have been made with the State in the  Memorandum of Agreement for the State to assume responsibility for these  permits. Retention of jurisdiction will include the processing of any  permit appeals, modification requests, or variance requests; the conduct  of inspections, and the receipt and review of self-monitoring reports.  If any permit appeal, modification request, or variance request is not  finally resolved when the federally issued permit expires, EPA may, with  the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is  resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures outlined in the preceding paragraph (f)(1) of  this section for the suspension of permitting authority and transfer of  existing permits will also apply when EPA approves an Indian Tribe's  application to operate a State sludge management program and a State was  the authorized permitting authority under Sec. 501.13 for sludge  management activities within the scope of the newly approved program.  The authorized State will retain jurisdiction over its existing permits  as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section absent a different  arrangement stated in the Memorandum of Agreement executed between EPA  and the Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notwithstanding approval of a State sludge program, EPA has the  authority to take enforcement actions for any violations of this part or  sections 405 or 309 of the CWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all  times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Nothing in this part precludes a State or political subdivision  thereof, or interstate agency, from adopting or enforcing requirements  established by State or local law that are more stringent or more  extensive than those required in this part or in any other federal  statute or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Nothing in this part precludes a State from operating a program  with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. If  an approved State program has greater scope of coverage than required by  federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally  approved program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Sections 106 (a) and (d) of the Marine Protection, Research, and  Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), 33 U.S.C. 1416, generally preclude States from  regulating or issuing permits for ocean dumping. Nothing in this  regulation is intended to confer on the States the authority to engage  in the regulation or permitting of ocean dumping in contravention of the  provisions of sections 106 (a) and (d) of the MPRSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The Administrator may allow a State sewage sludge management  agency to assign portions of its program responsibilities to local  agencies, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No assignment is made to a local agency which owns or operates a  POTW or other facility that treats or disposes of sewage sludge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The program description required by Sec. 501.12 of this part  identifies any assignment of program responsibilities to the local  agency(ies), describes the capabilities of the local agency to carry out  assigned functions, and includes copies of any documents which execute  the assignment and an agreement between the State sewage sludge  management agency and the local agency(ies) defining their respective  program responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Attorney General's Statement required by Sec. 501.13 of this  part   states that any assignment of program responsibilities to the local  agency(ies) described in the program description is valid under State  law and that State and local law do not otherwise prohibit the local  agency(ies) from executing the program responsibilities assigned by the  State sewage sludge management agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) required by Sec. 501.14 of  this part includes adequate provisions for the State sewage sludge  management agency's oversight of the program responsibilities assigned  to the local agency(ies);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The State sewage sludge management agency retains all  responsibility for the program reporting required by Sec. 501.21 of this  part and for all other activities required by this part or by the MOA  related to EPA oversight of the State's approved program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The State sewage sludge management agency retains full authority  and ultimate responsibility for administering all aspects of the State's  approved program in accordance with the requirements of this part and  the MOA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A State whose sludge management program has not been approved  under this part may submit to the Regional Administrator an application  for approval of a partial sewage sludge program. The following are the  requirements for approval of a partial program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A partial program submission must constitute a complete  management program covering one or more categories of sewage sludge use  or disposal. The program must also apply to anyone engaged in the sewage  sludge use or disposal practice that is the subject of the partial  program. A complete management program is one that provides for the  issuance of permits, the monitoring of compliance and, in the event of  violations, possible enforcement action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The partial program submission must also address the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Attorney General's Statement, in addition to the information  required by Sec. 501.13, must clearly explain the jurisdiction of the  administering agency or department;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The program description, in addition to the information  required by Sec. 501.12, must explain how the program will operate,  including which use and disposal practice(s) the State will cover. The  program description must also explain the relationship and coordination  between the proposed partial sewage sludge program and that part of the  program for which EPA will remain the permitting authority, including a  discussion of the division of permitting, enforcement, and compliance  monitoring responsibilities between the State and EPA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA and the State, in  addition to the information required by Sec. 501.14, must set out the  responsibilities of EPA and the State in administering the partial  program, including specific provisions for transfer of information and  determination of which users or disposers of sewage sludge are included  in the partial program.
