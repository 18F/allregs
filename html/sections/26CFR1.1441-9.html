                                Sec. 1.1441-9  Exemption from withholding on exempt income of a foreign
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> or 1442  based on its status as an organization described in section 501(c), it  must furnish the withholding agent with a withholding certificate  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A foreign organization  described in section 501(c) may choose to claim a reduced rate of  withholding under the procedures described in other sections of the  regulations under section 1441 and not under this section. In  particular, if an organization chooses to claim benefits under an income  tax treaty, the withholding procedures applicable to claims of such a  reduced rate are governed solely by the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-6 and  not of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reliance on foreign organization's claim of exemption from  withholding--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A withholding agent may rely on a claim  of exemption under this section only if, prior to the payment, the  withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid  withholding certificate described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3), or  (4) must be attached to the withholding certificate. An organization  that provides an opinion of U.S. counsel or an affidavit may provide the  same opinion or affidavit to more than one withholding agent provided  that the opinion is acceptable to each withholding agent who receives it  in conjunction with a withholding certificate. Any such opinion of  counsel or affidavit must be renewed whenever there is a change in facts  or circumstances that are relevant to determine the organization's  status under section 501(c) or, if relevant, that the organization is or  is not a private foundation described in section 509.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presumptions in the absence of documentation. Notwithstanding  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the organization's certification  with respect to whether amounts paid constitute income includable under  section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable  income is not reliable or is lacking but all other certifications are  reliable, the withholding agent may rely on the certificate but the  amounts paid are presumed to be income includable under section 512 in  computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income. If the  certification regarding private foundation status is not reliable, the  withholding agent may rely on the certificate but the amounts paid are  presumed to be paid to a foreign beneficial owner that is a private  foundation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reason to know. Reliance by a withholding agent on the  information and certifications stated on a withholding certificate is  subject to the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know that such  information or certification is incorrect as provided in Sec. 1.1441- 7(b). For example, a withholding agent must cease to treat a foreign  organization's claim for exemption from withholding based on the  organization's tax-exempt status as valid beginning on the earlier of  the date on which such agent knows that the IRS has given notice to such  foreign organization that it is not an organization described in section  501(c) or the date on which the IRS gives notice to the public that such  foreign organization is not an organization described in section 501(c).  Similarly, a withholding agent may no longer rely on a certification  that an amount is not subject to tax under section 4948 beginning on the  earlier of the date on which such agent knows that the IRS has given  notice to such foreign organization that it is subject to tax under  section 4948 or the date on which the IRS gives notice that such foreign  organization is a private foundation within the meaning of section  509(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to receive withholding certificate timely and other  applicable procedures. See applicable procedures described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the withholding agent does not hold a  valid withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation at the  time of payment. Further, the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4) shall  apply to withholding certificates and other documents related thereto  furnished under the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to payments  made after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> with respect to one or more withholding  certificates valid under the regulations in effect prior to January 1,  2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and, therefore,  to require withholding certificates conforming to the requirements  described in this section (new withholding certificates). For purposes  of this section, a new withholding certificate is deemed to satisfy the  documentation requirement under the regulations in effect prior to  January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999).  Further, a new withholding certificate remains valid for the period  specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless of when the certificate  is obtained.
