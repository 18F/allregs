content for use in alloying or to meet specifications for the casting. This requirement does not apply to material that is not scrap (e.g., ingots, alloys, sows) or to materials that are not purchased (e.g., internal scrap, customer returns).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepare and operate pursuant to a written management practices plan.
