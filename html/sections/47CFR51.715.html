                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon request from a telecommunications carrier without an existing interconnection arrangement with an incumbent LEC, the incumbent LEC shall provide transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic immediately under an interim arrangement, pending resolution of negotiation or arbitration regarding transport and termination rates and approval of such rates by a

state commission under sections 251 and 252 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This requirement shall not apply when the requesting carrier has an existing interconnection arrangement that provides for the transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic by the incumbent LEC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A telecommunications carrier may take advantage of such an interim arrangement only after it has requested negotiation with the incumbent LEC pursuant to Sec. 51.301.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a request as described in paragraph (a) of this section, an incumbent LEC must, without unreasonable delay, establish an interim arrangement for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic at symmetrical rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In a state in which the state commission has established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies, an incumbent LEC shall use these state-determined rates as interim transport and termination rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a state in which the state commission has not established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies, an incumbent LEC shall set interim transport and termination rates either at the default ceilings specified in Sec. 51.705(c) or in accordance with a bill-and-keep methodology as defined in Sec. 51.713.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a state in which the state commission has neither established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies nor established transport and termination rates consistent with the default price ranges described in Sec. 51.707, an incumbent LEC shall set interim transport and termination rates at the default ceilings for end-office switching (0.4 cents per minute of use), tandem switching (0.15 cents per minute of use), and transport (as described in Sec. 51.707(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An interim arrangement shall cease to be in effect when one of the following occurs with respect to rates for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic subject to the interim arrangement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A voluntary agreement has been negotiated and approved by a state commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agreement has been arbitrated and approved by a state commission; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period for requesting arbitration has passed with no such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the rates for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic in an interim arrangement differ from the rates established by a state commission pursuant to Sec. 51.705, the state commission shall require carriers to make adjustments to past compensation. Such adjustments to past compensation shall allow each carrier to receive the level of compensation it would have received had the rates in the interim arrangement equalled the rates later established by the state commission pursuant to Sec. 51.705.
