                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Background. (1) Certain areas, due to their strategic nature or for purposes of defense, have been subjected to restrictions regarding the free entry of persons, ships, and aircraft. Free entry into the areas listed and defined in this regulation, and military installations contiguous to or within the boundaries of defense site areas, is subject to control as provided for in the Executive Order 11021 of May 7, 1962 and Departments of Interior and Defense Agreement effective July 1, 1963, or other regulations. Such restrictions are imposed for defense purposes because of the unique strategic nature of the area and for the protection of the United

States Government military bases, stations, facilities, and other installations, and the personnel, property, and equipment assigned to or located therein. Persons, ships, and aircraft are excluded from KMR unless and until they are granted permission to enter under applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The control of entry into or movement within KMR by persons, ships, or aircraft will be exercised so as to protect fully the physical security of, and insure the full effectiveness of, bases, stations, facilities, other installations, and individuals within KMR. However, unnecessary interference with the free movement of persons, ships, and aircraft is to be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This regulation will be administered to provide the prompt processing of all applications and to insure uniformity of interpretation and application insofar as changing conditions permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In cases of doubt, the determination will be made in favor of the course of action which will best serve the interests of the United States and national defense as distinguished from the private interests of an individual or group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authority. (1) The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands is a strategic area administered by the United States under the provisions of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Former Japanese Mandated Islands, approved by the United Nations April 2, 1947. Congress, by 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1681, gave responsibility for this area to the President. By Executive Order 11021, the President delegated this authority to the Secretary of Interior. By agreement between the Secretary of Interior and Secretary of Defense, the Navy became responsible for all entry control July 1, 1963. With approval of the Secretary of Defense and Director of the Office of Territories, the authority to control entry into KMR was transferred to the Army in July of 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The authority of the Department of the Army to control entry of persons, ships, and aircraft into Kwajalein Missile Range is exercised through the Commander, Ballistic Missile Defense Systems Command, who is the National Range Commander.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Penalties are provided by law for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Violation of regulations imposed for the protection or security of military or naval aircraft, airports, air facilities, vessels, harbors, ports, piers, waterfront facilities, bases, forts, posts, laboratories, stations, vehicles, equipment, explosives, or other property or places subject to the jurisdiction of, administration of, or in the custody of the Department of Defense (sec. 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797) and Department of Defense Directive 5200.8 of 29 July 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Knowingly and willfully making a false or misleading statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States (18 U.S.C. 1001).</p>
