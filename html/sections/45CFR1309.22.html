                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The mortgage agreement, or security agreement in the case of a modular unit which is proposed to be purchased under a chattel mortgage, shall provide in the case of default by the grantee or the withdrawal or termination of the grantee from the Head Start program that ACF may intervene. In the case of a default, the mortgage agreement or security agreement must provide that ACF may intervene to ensure that the default is cured by the grantee or another agency designated by ACF and that the lender shall accept the payment of money or performance of any other obligation by ACF's designee, for the grantee, as if such payment of money of performance had been made by the grantee. The agreement shall also provide that ACF will have a period of 60 days after notification by the grantee of default in which to intervene to attempt to cure the default. The agreement shall further provide that in the event of a default, or the withdrawal or termination of the grantee the mortgage may be assumed by an organization designated by ACF. The mortgage or creditor will have the right to approve the organization designated to assume the mortgage, but such approval will not be withheld except for good reason. The required provisions must be included in the mortgages of facilities funded as continuing purchases pursuant to Sec. 1309.2 unless a convincing justification for not doing so is shown by the Head Start grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grantee must immediately provide the responsible HHS official with both telephonic and written notification of a default of any description on the part of the grantee under a real property or chattel mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that a default is not cured and foreclosure takes place, the mortgagee or creditor shall pay ACF that percentage of the proceeds from the foreclosure sale of the property attributable to the Federal share as defined in 45 CFR 74.2, or, if part 92 is applicable, to ACF's share as defined in 45 CFR 92.3. If ACF and the mortgagee or creditor have agreed that ACF's Federal interest will be subordinated to the mortgagee's or creditor's interest in the property, that agreement must be set forth in a written subordination agreement that is signed by the responsible HHS official and that complies with Sec. 1309.21 and any other applicable Federal law.
