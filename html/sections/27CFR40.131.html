Each bond and each extension of coverage of bond shall at the  time of filing be accompanied by a power of attorney authorizing the  agent or officer who executed the bond to so act on behalf of the  surety. The appropriate TTB officer who is authorized to approve the  bond may, whenever he deems it necessary, require additional evidence of  the authority of the agent or officer to execute the bond or extension  of coverage of bond. The power of attorney shall be prepared on a form  provided by the surety company and executed under the corporate seal of  the company. If the power of attorney submitted is other than a manually  signed document it shall be accompanied by a certificate of its  validity. Limitations concerning corporate sureties are prescribed by  the Secretary in Treasury Department Circular No. 570, as revised. The  surety shall have no interest whatever in the business covered by the  bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treasury Department Circular No. 570 (Companies Holding  Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as  Acceptable Reinsuring Companies) is published in the Federal Register  annually as of the first workday in July.
