                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification that an item meets the definition of an energy-conserving component or renewable energy source property. Upon the request of a manufacturer of an item pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section which is supported by proof that the item is entitled to be certified, the Assistant Commissioner (Technical) shall certify (or shall notify the manufacturer that the request is denied) that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The item meets the definition of insulation (see Sec.  1.23-2(c)(1)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The item meets the definition of an other energy-conserving component specified in section 23(c)(4) or former section 44C(c)(4) see (Sec.  1.23-2(d)(4)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The item meets the definition of solar energy property (see Sec.  1.23-2(f)), wind energy property (see Sec.  1.23-2(g)), or geothermal energy property (see Sec.  1.23-2(h)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The item meets the definition of a category of energy-conserving component that has been added to the list of approved items pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(viii) of Sec.  1.23-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The item meets the definition of renewable energy source property that transmits or uses a renewable energy source that has been added to the list of approved renewable energy sources pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of Sec.  1.23-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure--(1) In general. A manufacturer of an item desiring to apply under paragraph (a) shall submit the application to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), CC:C:E, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224. Upon being advised by the National Office, orally or in writing, that an adverse decision is contemplated a manufacturer may request a conference. The conference must be held within 21 calendar days from the date of that advice. Procedures for requesting an extension of the 21-day period and notifying the manufacturer of the Service's decision on that request are the same as those applicable to conferences on ruling requests by taxpayers (see section 9.05 of Rev. Proc. 80-20).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The application shall include a description of the item (including appropriate design drawings and specifications) and an explanation of the purpose and function of the item. There shall accompany the application a declaration in the following form: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this application, including accompanying documents and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts presented in support of the application are true, correct, and complete.'' The statement must be signed by the person or persons making the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of certification under paragraph (a). Certifications granted under paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) will be applied retroactively to April 20, 1977. However, certifications granted under paragraph (a) (4) or (5) will be applied retroactively only to the date the applicable energy-conserving component or renewable energy source was added by Treasury decision to the list of qualifying components or sources. Certification of an item under this section means that the applicable definitional requirement of Sec.  1.23-2 is considered satisfied in the case of any person claiming a residential energy credit with respect to such item. However, it does not relieve manufacturers of the need to establish that their items conform to performance and quality standards (if any) provided under Sec.  1.23-4 and that their items can reasonably be expected to remain in operation at least 3 years, in the case of insulation and other energy-conserving components, or at least 5 years, in the case of renewable energy source property.
