                            <p class="depth0">Critical habitat is designated to include all river reaches accessible to listed coho within the range of the ESUs listed, except for reaches on Indian lands defined in Tables 5 and 6 to this part. Critical habitat consists of the water, substrate, and adjacent riparian zone of estuarine and riverine reaches in hydrologic units and counties identified in Tables 5 and 6 to this part for all of the coho ESUs listed in this section. Accessible reaches are those within the historical range of the ESUs that can still be occupied by any life stage of coho salmon. Inaccessible reaches are those above longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years) and specific dams within the historical range of each ESU identified in Tables 5 and 6 to this part. Hydrologic units are those defined by the Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publication, ``Hydrologic Unit Maps,'' Water Supply Paper 2294, 1987, and the following DOI, USGS, 1:500,000 scale hydrologic unit maps: State of Oregon, 1974 and State of California, 1978 which are incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Critical habitat is designated to include all river reaches accessible to listed coho salmon from Punta Gorda in northern California south to the San Lorenzo River in central California, including Arroyo Corte Madera Del Presidio and Corte Madera Creek, tributaries to San Francisco Bay. Critical habitat consists of the water, substrate, and adjacent riparian zone of estuarine and riverine reaches (including off-channel habitats) in hydrologic units and counties identified in Table 5 of this part. Accessible reaches are those within the historical range of the ESU that can still be occupied by any life stage of coho salmon. Inaccessible reaches are those above specific dams identified in Table 5 of this part or above longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Southern Oregon/Northern California Coasts Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Critical habitat is designated to include all river reaches accessible to listed coho salmon between Cape Blanco, Oregon, and Punta Gorda, California. Critical habitat consists of the water, substrate, and adjacent riparian zone of estuarine

and riverine reaches (including off-channel habitats) in hydrologic units and counties identified in Table 6 of this part. Accessible reaches are those within the historical range of the ESU that can still be occupied by any life stage of coho salmon. Inaccessible reaches are those above specific dams identified in Table 6 of this part or above longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years).
