                                Sec. 1.354-1  Exchanges of stock and securities in certain
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(D)</em>  unless the transferor corporation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfers all or substantially all of its assets to a single  corporation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Distributes all of its remaining properties (if any) and the  stock, securities and other properties received in the exchange to its  shareholders or security holders in pursuance of the plan of  reorganization. The fact that properties retained by the transferor  corporation, or received in exchange for the properties transferred in  the reorganization, are used to satisfy existing   liabilities not represented by securities and which were incurred in the  ordinary course of business before the reorganization does not prevent  the application of section 354 to an exchange pursuant to a plan of  reorganization defined in section 368(a)(1)(D).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in section 354 (c) and (d), section 354 is  not applicable to an exchange of stock or securities if a greater  principal amount of securities is received than the principal amount of  securities the recipient surrenders, or if securities are received and  the recipient surrenders no securities. See, however, section 356 and  regulations pertaining to such section. See also section 306 with  respect to the receipt of preferred stock in a transaction to which  section 354 is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An exchange of stock or securities shall be subject to section  354(a)(1) even though--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such exchange is not pursuant to a plan of reorganization  described in section 368(a), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principal amount of the securities received exceeds the  principal amount of the securities surrendered or if securities are  received and no securities are surrendered--  if such exchange is pursuant to a plan of reorganization for a railroad  corporation as defined in section 77(m) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.  205(m)) and is approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission under  section 77 of such act or under section 20b of the Interstate Commerce  Act (49 U.S.C. 20b) as being in the public interest. Section 354 is not  applicable to such exchanges if there is received property other than  stock or securities. See, however, section 356 and regulations  pertaining to such section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The rules of section 354 may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Pursuant to a reorganization under section 368(a) to  which Corporations T and W are parties, A, a shareholder in Corporation  T, surrenders all his common stock in Corporation T in exchange for  common stock of Corporation W. No gain or loss is recognized to A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Pursuant to a reorganization under section 368(a) to  which Corporations X and Y (which are not railroad corporations) are  parties, B, a shareholder in Corporation X, surrenders all his stock in  X for stock and securities in Y. Section 354 does not apply to this  exchange. See, however, section 356.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. C, a shareholder in Corporation Z (which is not a  railroad corporation), surrenders all his stock in Corporation Z in  exchange for securities in Corporation Z. Whether or not this exchange  is in connection with a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E),  section 354 does not apply. See, however, section 302.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 of this paragraph  (d), except that C receivies solely rights to acquire stock in  Corporation Z. Section 354 does not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> applies to exchanges  occurring on or after March 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> See Sec. 1.356-7(a) and (b) for the treatment of nonqualified  preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(2)) received in certain  exchanges for nonqualified preferred stock or preferred stock. See Sec.  1.356-7(c) for the treatment of preferred stock received in certain  exchanges for common or preferred stock described in section  351(g)(2)(C)(i)(II).
