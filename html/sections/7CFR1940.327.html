354 may consider the concept of tiering in the preparation of environmental assessments and EISs. Tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements, such as one done for a national program or regulation, with subsequent narrower statements or environmental analyses incorporating by reference the broader matters and concentrating on the issues specific to the action under consideration. Tiering can be used when the sequence of analysis is from the program level to site-specific actions taken under that program or from an initial EIS to a supplement which discusses the issues requiring supplementation.</p>
