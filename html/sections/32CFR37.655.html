                                Sec. 37.655  Must I specify the frequency of IPAs' periodic audits
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If your expenditure-based TIA provides for periodic audits of a for- profit participant by an IPA, you must specify the frequency for those  audits. You should consider having an audit performed during the first  year of the award, when the participant has its IPA do its next  financial statement audit, unless the participant already   had a systems audit due to other Federal awards within the past two  years. The frequency thereafter may vary depending upon the dollars the  participant is expending annually under the award, but it is not  unreasonable to require an updated audit every two to three years to  reverify that the participant's systems are reliable (the audit then  would cover the two or three-year period between audits). The DCAA is a  source of advice on audit frequencies if your TIA provides for audits by  IPAs.</p>
