You must use kg (lb) of solids used as a measure of relative surface coating activity over a representative period of operation. You may estimate the relative mass of coating solids used from parameters other than coating consumption and mass solids content (e.g., design specifications for the parts or products coated and the number of items produced). The determination of predominant activity must accurately reflect current and projected coating operations and must be verifiable through appropriate documentation. The use of parameters other than coating consumption and mass solids content must be approved by the Administrator. You may use data for any reasonable time period of at least 1 year in determining the relative amount of coating activity, as long as they represent the way the source will continue to operate in the future and are approved by the Administrator. You must determine the predominant activity at your facility and submit the results of that determination with the initial notification required by Sec. 63.4510(b). Additionally, you must determine the facility's predominant activity annually and include the determination in the next semi-annual compliance report required by Sec. 63.4520(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may calculate and comply with a facility-specific emission limit as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. If you elect to comply using the facility-specific emission limit alternative, then compliance with the facility-specific emission limit and the emission limitations in this subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with this and other applicable

surface coating NESHAP. In calculating a facility-specific emission limit, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of the other subcategories and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of coating activities need not be included in the determination of predominant activity but must be included in the compliance calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You are required to calculate the facility-specific emission limit for your facility when you submit the notification of compliance status required in Sec. 63.4510(c), and on a monthly basis afterward using the coating data for the relevant 12-month compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the facility-specific emission limit for your surface coating operations for each 12-month compliance period.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19AP04.002
