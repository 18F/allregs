                                Sec. 1.1223-1  Determination of period for which capital assets are held.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The holding period of property received in an exchange by a  taxpayer includes the period for which the property which he exchanged  was held by him, if the property received has the same basis in whole or  in part for determining gain or loss in the hands of the taxpayer as the  property exchanged. However, this rule shall apply, in the case of  exchanges after March 1, 1954, only if the property exchanged was at the  time of the exchange a capital asset in the hands of   the taxpayer or property used in his trade or business as defined in  section 1231(b). For the purposes of this paragraph, the term exchange  includes the following transactions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An involuntary conversion described in section 1033, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356  as relates to section 355) applies.  Thus, if property acquired as the result of a compulsory or involuntary  conversion of other property of the taxpayer has under section 1033(c)  the same basis in whole or in part in the hands of the taxpayer as the  property so converted, its acquisition is treated as an exchange and the  holding period of the newly acquired property shall include the period  during which the converted property was held by the taxpayer. Thus,  also, where stock of a controlled corporation is received by a taxpayer  pursuant to a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section  356 as relates to section 355) applies, the distribution is treated as  an exchange and the period for which the taxpayer has held the stock of  the controlled corporation shall include the period for which he held  the stock of the distributing corporation with respect to which such  distribution was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The holding period of property in the hands of a taxpayer shall  include the period during which the property was held by any other  person, if such property has the same basis in whole or in part in the  hands of the taxpayer for determining gain or loss from a sale or  exchange as it would have in the hands of such other person. For  example, the period for which property acquired by gift after December  31, 1920, was held by the donor must be included in determining the  period for which the property was held by the taxpayer if, under the  provisions of section 1015, such property has, for the purpose of  determining gain or loss from the sale or exchange, the same basis in  the hands of the taxpayer as it would have in the hands of the donor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (or under section 112(g) of the  Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 818) or the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat.  197)), there shall be included the period for which he held the stock or  securities in the distributing corporation before the receipt of the  stock or securities on such distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the acquisition of stock or securities resulted in the  nondeductibility (under section 1091, relating to wash sales) of the  loss from the sale or other disposition of substantially identical stock  or securities, the holding period of the newly acquired securities shall  include the period for which the taxpayer held the securities with  respect to which the loss was not allowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The period for which the taxpayer has held stock, or stock  subscription rights, received on a distribution shall be determined as  though the stock dividend, or stock right, as the case may be, were the  stock in respect of which the dividend was issued if the basis for  determining gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of such  stock dividend or stock right is determined under section 307. If the  basis of stock received by a taxpayer pursuant to a spin-off is  determined under so much of section 1052(c) as refers to section  113(a)(23) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and such stock is sold  or otherwise disposed of in a taxable year which is subject to the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the period for which the taxpayer has  held the stock received in such spin-off shall include the period for  which he held the stock of the distributing corporation with respect to  which such distribution was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The period for which the taxpayer has held stock or securities  issued to him by a corporation pursuant to the exercise by him of rights  to acquire such stock or securities from the corporation will, in every  case and whether or not the receipt of taxable gain was recognized in  connection with the distribution of the rights, begin with and include  the day upon which the rights to acquire such stock or securities were  exercised. A taxpayer will be deemed to have exercised rights received  from a corporation to acquire stock or securities therein where there is  an expression of assent to the terms of such rights made by the taxpayer  in   the manner requested or authorized by the corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The period for which the taxpayer has held a residence, the  acquisition of which resulted under the provisions of section 1034 in  the nonrecognition of any part of the gain realized on the sale or  exchange of another residence, shall include the period for which such  other residence had been held as of the date of such sale or exchange.  See Sec. 1.1034-1. For purposes of this paragraph, the term sale or  exchange includes an involuntary conversion occurring after December 31,  1950, and before January 1, 1954.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a taxpayer accepts delivery of a commodity in satisfaction of  a commodity futures contract, the holding period of the commodity shall  include the period for which the taxpayer held the commodity futures  contract, if such futures contract was a capital asset in his hands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If shares of stock in a corporation are sold from lots purchased  at different dates or at different prices and the identity of the lots  cannot be determined, the rules prescribed by the regulations under  section 1012 for determining the cost or other basis of such stocks so  sold or transferred shall also apply for the purpose of determining the  holding period of such stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In the case of a person acquiring property, or to whom property  passed, from a decedent (within the meaning of section 1014(b)) dying  after December 31, 1970, such person shall be considered to have held  the property for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning  before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) if the  property:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has a basis in the hands of such person which is determined in  whole or in part under section 1014, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is sold or otherwise disposed of by such person within 6 months  after the decedent's death.  The provisions of this paragraph apply to sales of such property  included in the decedent's gross estate for the purposes of the estate  tax by the executor or administrator of the estate and to sales of such  property by other persons who have acquired property from the decedent.  The provisions of this paragraph may also be applicable to cases  involving joint tenancies, community property, and properties  transferred in contemplation of death. Thus, if a surviving joint  tenant, who acquired property by right of survivorship, sells or  otherwise disposes of such property within 6 months after the date of  the decedent's death, and the basis of the property in his hands is  determined in whole or in part under section 1014, the property shall be  considered to have been held by the surviving joint tenant for more than  6 months. Similarly, a surviving spouse's share of community property  shall be considered to have been held by her for more than 6 months if  it is sold or otherwise disposed of within 6 months after the date of  the decedent's death, regardless of when the property was actually  acquired by the marital community. For the purposes of this paragraph,  it is immaterial that the sale or other disposition produces gain or  loss. If property is considered to have been held for more than 6 months  by reason of this paragraph, it also is considered to have been held for  that period for purposes of section 1231 (if that section is otherwise  applicable).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Any reference in section 1223 or this section to another  provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is, where applicable, to  be deemed a reference to the corresponding provision of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939, or prior internal revenue laws. The provisions of  prior internal revenue laws here intended are the sections referred to  in the sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which correspond to  the sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 referred to in section  1223. Thus, the sections corresponding to section 1081(c) are section  371(c) of the Revenue Act of 1938 (52 Stat. 553) and section 371(c) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The sections corresponding to section  1091 are section 118 of each of the following: The Revenue Acts of 1928  (45 Stat. 826), 1932 (47 Stat. 208), 1934 (48 Stat. 715), 1936 (49 Stat.  1692), 1938 (52 Stat. 503), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12005, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7238, 37 FR  28717, Dec. 29, 1972; T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]</p>
