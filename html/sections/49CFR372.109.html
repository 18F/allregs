                            <p class="depth0">Interstate transportation performed by a cooperative association or  federation of cooperative associations for nonmembers who are not  farmers, cooperative associations, or federations of associations or the  United States Government for compensation, (except transportation  otherwise exempt under subtitle IV, part B, chapter 135 of title 49 of  the United States Code) shall be limited to that which is incidental to  its primary transportation operation and necessary for its effective  performance. It shall in no event exceed 25 percent of its total  interstate transportation services in any fiscal year, measured in terms  of tonnage. A cooperative association or federation of cooperative  associations may transport its own property, its members' property,  property of other farmers and the property of other cooperatives or  federations in accordance with existing law, except where the provisions  of Sec. 372.111 may be applicable to the limit on member/nonmember  transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The phrase ``incidental to its primary transportation operation  and necessary for its effective performance'' means that the interstate  transportation of the cooperative association or federation of  cooperative associations for nonmembers as described above is performed  with the same trucks or tractors employed in a prior or subsequent trip  in the primary transportation operation of the cooperative association  or federation, that it is not economically feasible to operate the  trucks or tractors empty on return trips (outbound trips in cases where  the primary transportation operation   is inbound to the association or federation), and that the additional  income obtained from such transportation is necessary to make the  primary transportation operation financially practicable. Transportation  for nonmembers as described above performed by a cooperative or  federation through the use of trucks or tractors trip-leased for one-way  movements with the cooperative association or federation acting as  leasee, is not incidental and necessary;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The base tonnage to which the 25-percent limitation is applied  is all tonnage of all kinds transported by the cooperative association  or federation of cooperative associations in interstate or foreign  commerce, whether for itself, its members or nonmembers, for or on  behalf of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof,  and that performed within the exemption provided by 49 U.S.C.  13506(a)(5).
