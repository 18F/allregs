                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Board) has issued this part (Regulation W) under the authority of  sections 23A(f) and 23B(e) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) (12 U.S.C.  371c(f), 371c-1(e)) section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C.  1468), and section 312(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5412).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12  U.S.C. 371c, 371c-1) establish certain quantitative limits and other  prudential requirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain  other transactions between a member bank and its affiliates. This  regulation implements sections 23A and 23B by defining terms used in the  statute, explaining the statute's requirements, and exempting certain  transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. Sections 23A and 23B and this regulation apply by their  terms to ``member banks''--that is, any national bank, State bank, trust  company, or other institution that is a member of the Federal Reserve  System. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.  1828(j)) applies sections 23A and 23B to insured State nonmember banks  in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were member banks.  The Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1468(a)) also applies sections 23A  and 23B to insured savings   associations in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were  member banks (and imposes two additional restrictions).
