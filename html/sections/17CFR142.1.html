(For purposes of this part the term Commission employees includes all present and former Commissioners and employees of the Commission). This part is intended to provide indemnification for adverse judgments for constitutional and federal statutory torts excepted from the Federal Tort Claims Act exclusive remedy provision 28 U.S.C. 2679(b) (as amended by the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-694)). In any lawsuit which is filed against the employee alleging a common law tort occurring within the scope of employment, the United States may be substituted for the individual employee and any liability which may be found will be assessed against the government, pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988.</p>
