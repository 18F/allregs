the account when such transfers or payments are made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, or in person, or when such payments are made by telephone (via check mailed to the depositor).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to ensure that no more than the number of transfers specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are made, a savings association must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prevent transfers of funds in excess of the limitations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adopt procedures to monitor those transfers on an after-the-fact basis and contact customers who exceed the limits on more than an occasional basis. For customers who continue to violate those limits after being contacted by the depository savings association the depository savings association must either place funds in another account that the depositor is eligible to maintain or take away the account's transfer and draft capacities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Insured savings association at their option, may use on a consistent basis either the date on a check or the date it is paid in determining whether the transfer limitations within the specified interval are exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal savings associations may offer MMDAs to any depositor, and state-chartered savings associations may offer MMDAs to any depositor not inconsistent with applicable state law.
