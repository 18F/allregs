                            <p class="depth0">The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured as applicable as specified in this section. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities shall adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must use any of the methods described as follows in this paragraph to conduct leak detection(s) of equipment leaks and through-valve leakage from all source types listed in Sec. 98.233(k), (o), (p) and (q) that occur during a calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Optical gas imaging instrument. Use an optical gas imaging instrument for equipment leak detection in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, subpart A, Sec. 60.18 of the Alternative work practice for monitoring equipment leaks, Sec. 60.18(i)(1)(i); Sec. 60.18(i)(2)(i) except that

the monitoring frequency shall be annual using the detection sensitivity level of 60 grams per hour as stated in 40 CFR Part 60, subpart A, Table 1: Detection Sensitivity Levels; Sec. 60.18(i)(2)(ii) and (iii) except the gas chosen shall be methane, and Sec. 60.18(i)(2)(iv) and (v); Sec. 60.18(i)(3); Sec. 60.18(i)(4)(i) and (v); including the requirements for daily instrument checks and distances, and excluding requirements for video records. Any emissions detected by the optical gas imaging instrument is a leak unless screened with Method 21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) monitoring, in which case 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak. In addition, you must operate the optical gas imaging instrument to image the source types required by this subpart in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's operating parameters. Unless using methods in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an optical gas imaging instrument must be used for all source types that are inaccessible and cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 21. Use the equipment leak detection methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21. If using Method 21 monitoring, if an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected. Inaccessible emissions sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 60, are not exempt from this subpart. Owners or operators must use alternative leak detection devices as described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section to monitor inaccessible equipment leaks or vented emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Infrared laser beam illuminated instrument. Use an infrared laser beam illuminated instrument for equipment leak detection. Any emissions detected by the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument is a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, in which case 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak. In addition, you must operate the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument to detect the source types required by this subpart in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's operating parameters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acoustic leak detection device. Use the acoustic leak detection device to detect through-valve leakage. When using the acoustic leak detection device to quantify the through-valve leakage, you must use the instrument manufacturer's calculation methods to quantify the through-valve leak. When using the acoustic leak detection device, if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated, a leak is detected. In addition, you must operate the acoustic leak detection device to monitor the source valves required by this subpart in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's operating parameters. Acoustic stethoscope type devices designed to detect through valve leakage when put in contact with the valve body and that provide an audible leak signal but do not calculate a leak rate can be used to identify non-leakers with subsequent measurement required to calculate the rate if through-valve leakage is identified. Leaks are reported if a leak rate of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must operate and calibrate all flow meters, composition analyzers and pressure gauges used to measure quantities reported in Sec. 98.233 according to the procedures in Sec. 98.3(i) and the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Gas Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use calibrated bags (also known as vent bags) only where the emissions are at near-atmospheric pressures and below the maximum temperature specified by the vent bag manufacturer such that the bag is safe to handle. The bag opening must be of sufficient size that the entire emission can be tightly encompassed for measurement till the bag is completely filled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hold the bag in place enclosing the emissions source to capture the entire emissions and record the time required for completely filling the bag. If the bag inflates in less than one second, assume one second inflation time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Perform three measurements of the time required to fill the bag, report the emissions as the average of the three readings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Estimate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in Sec. 98.233(t).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Estimate CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions from volumetric natural gas emissions using the calculations in Sec. 98.233(u) and (v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use a high volume sampler to measure emissions within the capacity of the instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A technician following manufacturer instructions shall conduct measurements, including equipment manufacturer operating procedures and measurement methods relevant to using a high volume sampler, including positioning the instrument for complete capture of the equipment leak without creating backpressure on the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the high volume sampler, along with all attachments available from the manufacturer, is not able to capture all the emissions from the source then use anti-static wraps or other aids to capture all emissions without violating operating requirements as provided in the instrument manufacturer's manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Estimate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in Sec. 98.233(t). Estimate CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions from volumetric natural gas emissions using the calculations in Sec. 98.233(u) and (v).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calibrate the instrument at 2.5 percent methane with 97.5 percent air and 100 percent CH4 by using calibrated gas samples and by following manufacturer's instructions for calibration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Peng Robinson Equation of State means the equation of state defined by Equation W-41 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23DE11.026
Where:
p = Absolute pressure.R = Universal gas constant.T = Absolute temperature.Vm = Molar volume.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23DE11.027
Where:
[omega] = Acentric factor of the species.

Tc = Critical temperature.Pc = Critical pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special reporting provisions for best available monitoring methods in reporting year 2015--(1) Best available monitoring methods.
