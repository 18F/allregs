                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consideration of offers. Unless otherwise specified in the  Invitation, CCC will consider offers on a daily basis from the date of  issuance of the Invitation until such time that CCC announces that  offers will no longer be accepted under the Invitation, the total  quantity of the eligible commodity announced in the Invitation has been  awarded, or the Invitation has expired as indicated by the expiration  date shown in the Invitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to the submission of an offer to CCC, the eligible  exporter must have entered into a sales contract, as defined in Sec.  1494.201(bb), with an eligible buyer for the export sale and the  delivery of the eligible commodity to the eligible country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of sale of the eligible exporter's sales contract with  an eligible buyer must be after the issuance date of the applicable  Invitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sales contract between the eligible exporter and an eligible  buyer may be conditioned upon the eligible exporter's entering into an  Agreement with CCC under the EEP for the payment of a bonus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CCC will not be responsible to any person for any loss caused by  the failure of the eligible exporter to obtain a CCC bonus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The eligible exporter must promptly notify CCC in writing of any   amendment to the sales contract with an eligible buyer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of offers.

The date and time affixed to submissions will be as  determined by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of offers. Offers to CCC for a CCC bonus under the EEP  must contain the information shown below in the same numerical order as  shown below. CCC reserves the right to reject any offer that so  materially departs from this prescribed format that its consideration  would hinder the offer review process. The applicable Invitation may  require the submission of further information necessary for the  consideration of an offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of the numerical designation assigned to the applicable  Invitation, which shall signify that the offer is submitted subject to  all the terms and conditions of this subpart and the Invitation in  response to which the offer is being submitted for consideration by CCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section  could be stated as follows: ``Invitation No. GSM-500-1, Revision No. X,  For Consideration After 3 p.m. on August 1, 1991.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The full business name and address of the eligible exporter  making the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and title of the individual signing the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The telephone number and telex or facsimile number of the  eligible exporter submitting the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The CCC bonus in dollar and cents requested by the eligible  exporter for each unit of measure of the eligible commodity to be  exported to the eligible country. The offer shall contain only one CCC  bonus. In offers submitted in response to an Invitation in which CCC has  announced the bonus amount, the eligible exporter shall state the dollar  and cents amount of the Announced CCC Bonus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The quantity, on a net weight basis, (less any dockage, if  applicable) of the eligible commodity for which the eligible exporter  wishes to receive a CCC bonus pursuant to an EEP Agreement. This  quantity shall be exclusive of tolerances and expressed in the unit of  measure specified in the applicable Invitation. This quantity may be  less than the sales contract quantity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The U.S. coast of export. The Invitation may require the  eligible exporter to indicate: The coasts of export if more than one  coast of export is allowed for an offer; the Canadian port if the  eligible commodity is to be transshipped through a Canadian port on the  St. Lawrence River; or the U.S. city and state from which the shipments  will cross the border into the eligible country if the eligible  commodity is to be shipped by rail or truck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The quality of the eligible commodity to be exported to the  eligible buyer, if required by the applicable Invitation, including any  additional quality specifications not found in the Invitation but  included in the tender specifications by the eligible buyer or the sales  contract with the eligible buyer.

The possible  credit payment terms referenced in an offer are for CCC's information  only and are not to be construed as a contingency for consideration or  acceptance. The eligible exporter is fully responsible for the  arrangement of such payment terms independently from the EEP offer and  CCC bears no responsibility if such credit payment terms cannot be  secured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The delivery period specified in the sales contract expressed  on the basis of either shipment from the United States or the Canadian  transshipment port or arrival in the eligible country.

CCC will reject an offer if  the eligible exporter states that it is unable to provide the required  certifications, unless CCC determines that acceptance of the offer would  be in the best interests of the EEP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditional offers. Any qualification or condition in, or added  to, the offer and not expressly authorized by this subpart or the  applicable Invitation may make such offer ineligible for consideration  by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CCC's right to additional information. CCC may require the  individual who signed the offer to provide documentary evidence of such  individual's authority to execute an Agreement with CCC on behalf of the  eligible exporter making the offer.
