                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Grants awarded under Sec.  17.351 shall not exceed the amounts  provided by the appropriation acts of the Congress of the United States  for the purpose. Funds appropriated for the upgrading and replacement of  equipment at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, or for rehabilitating  its equipment, shall remain available in consecutive fiscal years until  expanded, but in no event shall exceed the amount of $500,000 per year.  It is not intended that such funds will be utilized to expand the  medical center facilities. Upgrading of equipment, however, would permit  purchase of new and additional equipment not now possessed by the  medical center.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1732)  [47 FR 58250, Dec. 30, 1982]</p>
