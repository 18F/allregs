                            <p class="depth0">Whenever a manufacturer of tobacco products desires to submit a  claim for remission of tax liability on shortages of tobacco products in  bond, disclosed by physical inventory as set forth in Sec. 40.255, he  shall prepare such claim on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. Both copies of  the claim shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The claim  shall specify the quantities of tobacco products on which claim is made  and the tax liability in respect thereof, and shall set forth the  circumstances surrounding the shortage and the reason the manufacturer  believes tax is not due or payable. The appropriate TTB officer will,  after such investigation as he deems appropriate, allow the claim to the  extent he is satisfied the shortage was due to operating losses such as  damage during grading, sorting, or packaging, and was not caused by  theft or other unlawful or improper removal. Upon action on the claim by  the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to  the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained  by the manufacturer.  (72 Stat. 1414, as amended, 1417, 1419, as amended; 26 U.S.C. 5701,  5703, 5705)  [T.D. 6961, 33 FR 9489, June 28, 1968. Redesignated at 40 FR 16835, Apr.  15, 1975, and amended by T.D.
