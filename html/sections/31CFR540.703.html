                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to  the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30 day period set forth in  this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension  of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The  failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth  in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to  respond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty  notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or  foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider  (if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the  postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed.  If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the  prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or  before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt  maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty  notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal  Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked  or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a  federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the  following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at  the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request  to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in  writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any  particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by  facsimile, but the original must also be sent to the Office of Foreign  Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be  postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of response. A written response must contain  information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the  prepenalty notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written response must include the respondent's full name,  address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those  of the representative of the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written response should either admit or deny each specific  violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the  respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written  response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the  prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be  admitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written response should include any information in defense,  evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the  respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider.  Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign  Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written  response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be  considered waived. The written response should   also set forth the reasons why the respondent believes the penalty  should not be imposed or why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser  amount than proposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written  response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this  section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the  respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The  agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the  penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a  written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's  representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as  advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of  allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters.  However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as  to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In  the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in  the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be  required to take a written position on allegations contained in the  prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no  final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount  accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary  from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a  formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is  reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for  written response to the prepenalty notice remains in effect unless  additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on  behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of  Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the  specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded  by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was  served upon the respondent in care of the representative.</p>
