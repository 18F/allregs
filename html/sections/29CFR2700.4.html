                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Party status. A person, including the Secretary or an operator,  who is named as a party or who is permitted to intervene, is a party. In  a proceeding instituted by the Secretary under section 105(c)(2) of the  Act, 30 U.S.C. 815(c)(2), the complainant on whose behalf the Secretary  has filed the complaint is a party and may present additional evidence  on his own behalf. A miner, applicant for employment, or representative  of a miner who has filed a complaint with the Commission under section  105(c)(3) or 111 of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 815(c)(3) and 821, and an  affected miner or his representative who has become a party in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, are parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intervention--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intervention by affected miners and their  representatives. Before a case has been assigned to a Judge, affected  miners or their representatives shall be permitted to intervene upon  filing a written notice of intervention with the Executive Director,  Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, 1331 Pennsylvania  Avenue NW., Suite 520N, Washington, DC 20004-1710. If the case has been  assigned to a Judge, the notice of intervention shall be filed with the  Judge. The Commission or the Judge shall mail forthwith a copy of the  notice to all parties. After the start of the hearing, affected miners  or their representatives may intervene upon just terms and for good  cause shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intervention by other persons. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Motions by other persons for  leave to intervene shall be filed before the start of a hearing on the  merits unless the Judge, for good cause shown, allows a later filing.  The motion shall set forth:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The interest of the movant relating to the property or events  that are the subject of the proceeding;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The reasons why such interest is not otherwise adequately  represented by the parties already involved in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A showing that intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice  the adjudication of the issues.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such intervention is not a matter of right but of the sound  discretion of the Judge. In denying a motion to intervene, the Judge may  alternatively permit the movant to participate in the proceeding as  amicus curiae.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for participation as amicus curiae. Any person may  move to participate as amicus curiae in a proceeding before a Judge.  Such participation as amicus curiae shall not be a matter of right but  of the sound discretion of the Judge. A motion for participation as  amicus curiae shall set forth the interest of the movant and show that  the granting of the motion will not unduly delay or prejudice the  adjudication of the issues. If the Judge permits amicus curiae  participation, the Judge's order shall specify the time within which  such amicus curiae memorandum, brief, or other pleading must be filed  and the time within which a reply may be made. The movant may  conditionally attach its memorandum, brief, or other pleading to its  motion for participation as amicus curiae.
