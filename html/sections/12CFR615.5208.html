                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following conditions apply to agreements that a Farm Credit  Bank or agricultural credit bank enters into with an affiliated  association pursuant to Sec. 615.5207(b)(2):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agreement must be for a term of 1 year or longer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agreement must be entered into on or before its effective  date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agreement may be amended according to its terms, but no more  frequently than annually except in the event that a party to the  agreement is merged or reorganized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified  copy of the agreement, and any amendments thereto, must be sent to the  field office of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining  the institution. A copy must also be sent within 30 calendar days of  adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unless the parties otherwise agree, if the bank and the  association have not entered into a new agreement on or before the  expiration of an existing agreement, the existing agreement will  automatically be extended for another 12 months, unless either party  notifies the Farm Credit Administration in writing of its objection to  the extension prior to the expiration of the existing agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the absence of an agreement between a Farm Credit Bank or an  agricultural credit bank and one or more associations, or in the event  that an agreement expires and at least one party has timely objected to  the continuation of the terms of its agreement, the following formula  applies with respect to the allocated investments held by those  associations with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing  associations), and does not apply to the allocated investments held by  those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing  associations):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The allotment formula must be calculated annually.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or  agricultural credit bank must be computed as of the date that the  existing agreement terminates, using a 3-month average daily balance,  excluding the allocated investment from nonagreeing associations but  including any allocated investments of agreeing associations that are  allotted to the bank under applicable allocation agreements. The  permanent capital ratio of each nonagreeing association must be computed  as of the same date using a 3-month average daily balance, and must be  computed excluding its allocated investment in the bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the permanent capital ratio for the Farm Credit Bank or  agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with  Sec. 615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or   above, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association whose  permanent capital ratio calculated in accordance with  Sec. 615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or above must be allotted 50 percent to  the bank and 50 percent to the association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or  agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with  Sec. 615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of  each nonagreeing association whose capital ratio is below 7 percent must  be allotted to the association until the association's capital ratio  reaches 7 percent or until all of the investment is allotted to the  association, whichever occurs first. Any remaining unallotted allocated  investment must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the  association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or  agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with  Sec. 615.5208(b)(2) is less than 7 percent, the amount of additional  capital needed by the bank to reach a permanent capital ratio of 7  percent must be determined, and an amount of the allocated investment of  each nonagreeing association must be allotted to the Farm Credit Bank or  agricultural credit bank, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the total of the allocated investments of all nonagreeing  associations is greater than the additional capital needed by the bank,  the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association must be  multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the amount of capital needed  by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated  investments of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount must be  allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio of any  nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of  unallotted allocated investment must then be allotted to each  nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital  ratio to 7 percent, or until all such remaining investment is allotted  to the association, whichever occurs first. Any unallotted allocated  investment still remaining must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and  50 percent to the nonagreeing association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the additional capital needed by the bank is greater than  the total of the allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations,  all of the remaining allocated investments of the nonagreeing  associations must be allotted to the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a payment or part of a payment to the Farm Credit System  Financial Assistance Corporation pursuant to section 6.9(e)(3)(D)(ii) of  the Act would cause a bank to fall below its minimum permanent capital  requirement, the bank and one or more associations shall amend their  allocation agreements to increase the allotment of the allocated  investment to the bank sufficiently to enable the bank to make the  payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation,  provided that the associations would continue to meet their minimum  permanent capital requirement. In the case of a nonagreeing association,  the Farm Credit Administration may require a revision of the allotment  sufficient to enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit  System Financial Assistance Corporation, provided that the association  would continue to meet its minimum permanent capital requirement. The  Farm Credit Administration may, at the request of one or more of the  institutions affected, waive the requirements of this paragraph if the  FCA deems it is in the overall best interest of the institutions  affected.
