                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permit applications for archeological research are reviewed for completeness, compliance with program policies, and adherence to the guidelines of this subpart. Incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant for clarification. Complete applications are reviewed by NHC personnel and, when necessary, outside experts. In addition to the criteria set forth in Sec. 767.6, applications are also judged on the basis of: relevance or importance; archeological merits; appropriateness and environmental consequences of technical approach; and qualifications of the applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) about the need to comply with section 106 of the NHPA. A section 106 review may require the NHC to consult with the appropriate SHPO and the ACHP. The ACHP review can take up to 60 days beyond the NHC's required 120-day review. Therefore, the entire review process may take up to 180 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The NHC shall send applications for research at sites located in units of the national park system, national wildlife refuge system, and national marine sanctuary system to the appropriate Federal land manager for review. The Federal land manager is responsible for ensuring that the proposed work is consistent with any management plan or established policy, objectives or requirements applicable to the management of the public lands concerned. NHC shall send applications for research at sites located on state bottomlands to the appropriate state agency for review. The burden of obtaining any and all additional permits or authorizations, such as from a state or foreign government or agency, private individual or organization, or from another federal agency, is on the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Based on the findings of the NHC evaluation, the NHC Underwater Archeologist will recommend an appropriate action to the NHC Director. If approved, NHC will issue the permit; if denied, applicants are notified of the reason for denial and may appeal within 30 days of receipt of the denial. Appeals must be submitted in writing to: Director of Naval History, Naval Historical Center, 805 Kidder Breese St. SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20374-5060.</p>
