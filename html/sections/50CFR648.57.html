                            <p class="depth0">An area rotation program is established for the scallop fishery, which may include areas closed to scallop fishing defined in Sec. 648.58, and/or Sea

Scallop Access Areas defined in Sec. 648.59, subject to the Sea Scallop Area Access program requirements specified in Sec. 648.60. Areas not defined as Rotational Closed Areas, Sea Scallop Access Areas, EFH Closed Areas, or areas closed to scallop fishing under other FMPs, are open to scallop fishing as governed by the other management measures and restrictions in this part. The Council's development of area rotation programs is subject to the framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.55, including the Area Rotation Program factors included in Sec. 648.55(a). The percentage of the total allowable catch for each Sea Scallop Access Area that is allocated to limited access scallop vessels and limited access general category scallop vessels shall be through the framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.55.
