                            <p class="depth0">Chloromethylated aminated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer (CAS Reg.  No. 60177-39-1) may be safely used in food in accordance with the  following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The additive is an aqueous dispersion of styrene-divinylbenzene  copolymers, first chloromethylated then aminated with trimethylamine,  having an average particle size of not more than 2.0 microns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The additive shall contain no more than 3.0 percent nonvolatile,  soluble extractives when tested as follows: One hundred grams of the  additive is centrifuged at 17,000 r/min for 2 hours. The resulting clear  supernatant is removed from the compacted solids and concentrated to  approximately 10 grams on a steam bath. The 10-gram sample is again  centrifuged at 17,000 r/min for 2 hours to remove any residual insoluble  material. The supernatant   from the second centrifugation is then removed from any compacted solids  and dried to constant residual weight using a steam bath. The percent  nonvolatile solubles is obtained by dividing the weight of the dried  residue by the weight of the solids in the original resin dispersion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The additive is used as a decolorizing and clarification agent  for treatment of refinery sugar liquors and juices at levels not to  exceed 500 parts of additive solids per million parts of sugar solids.
