                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offset from retirement payments. A debt may be collected in  whole or in part from lump-sum retirement payment or recurring annuity  payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Offset from other payments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administrative offset. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A  debt may be offset from other payments due the debtor from other  agencies in accordance with 4 CFR 102.3, except that offset from back  pay awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5596 (and 5 CFR 550.801 et  seq.) will be made in accordance with Sec. 550.805(e)(2) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In determining whether to collect claims by means of  administrative offset after the expiration of the six year limitation  provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his designee will determine  the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than 6  years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount of the  debt; the cost of collection; and the likelihood of recovering the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Salary offset. When the debtor is an employee, or a member of  the Armed Forces or a reserve component of the Armed Forces, OPM may  effect collection action by offset of the debtor's pay in accordance  with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 et seq. Due process described in  Sec. 831.1304 will apply. The questions of fact and liability, and  entitlements to waiver or compromise determined through that process are  deemed correct and will not be amended under salary offset procedures.  When the debtor did not receive a hearing on the amount of the offset  under Sec. 831.1304 and requests such hearing, one will be conducted in  accordance with subpart K of part 550 of this chapter.</p>
