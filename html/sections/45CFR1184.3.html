                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where to send a request. You may make a FOIA request for IMLS records by writing directly to the FOIA Officer, Institute of Museum and Library Services, 1800 M Street NW., 9th Floor, Washington, DC 20036-5802. Requests may also be sent by facsimile to the FOIA Officer at (202) 653-4625 or by email to foia@imls.gov. You may also submit your FOIA request online through the IMLS FOIA Request Form located at: http://www.imls.gov/about/foia--request--form.aspx.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of request. Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your name and mailing address, and should be clearly identified as a Freedom of Information Act or ``FOIA'' request. You must describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to identify and locate the records, including, if possible, dates, subjects, titles, or authors of the records requested. If IMLS determines

that your request does not reasonably describe the requested records, the agency will advise you what additional information is required to perfect your request, or why your request is otherwise insufficient. You should also indicate if you have a preferred form or format in which you would like to receive the requested records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic format records. IMLS will provide the responsive records in the form or format you request if the records are readily reproducible by IMLS in that form or format. IMLS will make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure. IMLS may disclose records in electronic format if the records can be downloaded or transferred intact through electronic media currently in use by the agency. In responding to a request for records, IMLS will make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except where such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of receipt. IMLS considers a request that complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to be a perfected request. The agency considers a request to be received on the date that the request is perfected.</p>
