                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A claimant may obtain judicial review of a decision by an administrative law judge if the Appeals Council has denied the claimant's request for review, or of a decision by the Appeals Council when that is the final decision of the Commissioner. A claimant may also obtain judicial review of a reconsidered determination, or of a decision of an administrative law judge, where, under the expedited appeals procedure, further administrative review is waived by agreement under Secs. 404.926, 410.629d, or 416.1426 of this chapter or 42 CFR 405.718a-e as appropriate. For judicial review as to the amount of benefits under part A or part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, or of health services to be

provided by a health maintenance organization without additional cost, the amount in controversy must be $1,000 or more as provided under section 1869(b) and section 1876(c)(5)(B) of the Act. For judicial review of a determination by a PRO, the amount in controversy must be $2,000 or more. An institution or agency may obtain judical review of a decision by the Appeals Council that it is not a provider of services, or of a decision by the Appeals Council terminating an agreement entered into by the institution or agency with the Commissioner (see section 1866(b)(2) of the Act). The Social Security Act does not provide for a right to judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner regarding the status of an entity which is not a ``provider of services'', such as an independent laboratory. Providers of services or other persons may seek judicial review of a final administrative determination made pursuant to section 1128(b)(6) of the Act. There are no amount-in-controversy limitations on these rights of appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Court in which to institute civil action. Any civil action described in paragraph (a) of this section must be instituted in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the claimant resides or where such individual or institution or agency has his principal place of business. If the individual does not reside within any such judicial district, or if such individual or institution or agency does not have his principal place of business within any such judicial district, the civil action must be instituted in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for instituting civil action. Any civil action described in paragraph (a) of this section must be instituted within 60 days after the Appeals Council's notice of denial of request for review of the administrative law judge's decision or notice of the decision by the Appeals Council is received by the individual, institution, or agency, except that this time may be extended by the Appeals Council upon a showing of good cause. For purposes of this section, the date of receipt of notice of denial of request for review of the presiding officer's decision or notice of the decision by the Appeals Council shall be presumed to be 5 days after the date of such notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. Where pursuant to the expedited appeals procedures an agreement has been entered into under 42 CFR 405.718c, a civil action under section 205(g) of the Act must be commenced within 60 days from the date of the signing of such agreement by, or on behalf of, the Commissioner, except where the time described in the first sentence of this paragraph (c) has been extended by the Commissioner upon a showing of good cause. Where pursuant to the expedited appeals procedures an agreement has been entered into under Sec. 404.926, Sec. 410.629d, or Sec. 416.1426 of this chapter, a civil action under section 205(g) of the Act must be commenced within 60 days after the date the individual receives notice (a signed copy of the agreement will be mailed to the individual and will constitute notice) of the signing of such agreement by, or on behalf of, the Commissioner, except where the time described in this paragraph (c) has been extended by the Commissioner upon a showing of good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proper defendant. Where any civil action described in paragraph (a) of this section is instituted, the person holding the Office of the Commissioner shall, in his official capacity, be the proper defendant. Any such civil action properly instituted shall survive notwithstanding any change of the person holding the Office of the Commissioner or any vacancy in such office. If the complaint is erroneously filed against the United States or against any agency, officer, or employee of the United States other than the Commissioner, the plaintiff will be notified that he has named an incorrect defendant and will be granted 60 days from the date of receipt of such notice in which to commence the action against the correct defendant, the Commissioner.
