                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 426.12 and 426.14, all  nonexempt land directly or indirectly owned by a landholder counts  against that landholder's ownership entitlement. In addition, land owned  or controlled by a public entity that is leased to another party counts  against the lessee's ownership entitlement, as specified in Sec.  426.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified recipient ownership entitlement. A qualified recipient  is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 960 acres of  owned nonexempt land, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. This  entitlement applies on a westwide basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited recipient ownership entitlement. A limited recipient is  entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 640 acres of owned  nonexempt land, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. This entitlement  applies on a westwide basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior law recipient ownership entitlement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ownership  entitlements for prior law recipients are determined by whether the  recipient is one individual or a married couple, and for entities by the  type of entity, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual subject to prior law is entitled to receive  irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Married couples who hold equal interests are entitled to  receive irrigation water on a maximum of 320 acres of jointly owned  nonexempt land;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Surviving spouses until remarriage are entitled to receive  irrigation   water on that land owned jointly in marriage up to a maximum of 320  acres of owned nonexempt land. If any of that land should be sold, the  applicable ownership entitlement would be reduced accordingly, but not  to less than 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Children are each entitled to receive irrigation water on a  maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land, regardless of whether they  are independent or dependent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Joint tenancies and tenancies-in-common subject to prior law are  entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned  nonexempt land per tenant, provided each tenant holds an equal interest  in the tenancy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Partnerships subject to prior law are entitled to receive  irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land per  partner if the partners have separable and equal interests in the  partnership and the right to alienate that interest.

For land acquired by the  current owner on or before that date, prior law ownership entitlements  apply on a district-by-district basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For those entities where an equal interest held by the part  owners would result in a 160-acre per part owner entitlement for the  entity, if the part owners interests are not equal then the entitlement  of the entity will be determined by the relative interest held in the  entity by each part owner.</p>
