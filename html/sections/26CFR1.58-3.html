                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) Section 58(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> provides that the sum of the  items of tax preference of an estate or trust shall be apportioned  between the estate or trust and the beneficiary on the basis of the  income of the estate or trust allocable to each. Income for this purpose  is the income received or accrued by the trust or estate which is not  subject to current taxation either in the hands of the trust or estate  or the beneficiary by reason of an item of tax preference. The character  of the amounts distributed is determined under section 652(b) or 662(b)  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional computations required by reason of excess  distributions are to be made in accordance with the principles of  sections 665 through 669 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a charitable remainder annuity trust (as defined  in section 664(d)(1) and Sec.  1.664-2) or a charitable remainder  unitrust (as defined in section 664(d)(2) and Sec.  1.664-3), the  determination of the income not subject to current taxation by reason of  an item of tax preference is to be made as if such trust were generally  subject to taxation. Where income of such a trust is not subject to  current taxation in accordance with this section and is distributed to a  beneficiary in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which  the trust received or accrued such income, the items of tax preference  relating to such income are apportioned to the beneficiary in such  subsequent year (without credit for minimum tax paid by the trust with  respect to items of tax preference which are subject to the minimum tax  by reason of section 664(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Items of tax preference apportioned to a beneficiary pursuant to  this section are to be taken into account by the beneficiary in his  taxable year within or with which ends the taxable year of the estate or  trust during which it has such items of tax preference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where a trust or estate has items of income or deduction which  enter   into the computation of the excess investment interest item of tax  preference, but such items do not result in an item of tax preference at  the trust or estate level, each beneficiary must take into account, in  computing his excess investment interest, the portion of such items  distributed to him. The determination of the portion of such items  distributed to each beneficiary is made in accordance with the character  rules of section 652(b) or 662(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where, pursuant to subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J (sections  671 through 678), the grantor of a trust or another person is treated as  the owner of any portion of the trust, there shall be included in  computing the items of tax preference of such person those items of  income, deductions, and credits against tax of the trust which are  attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent such items are  taken into account under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. Any  remaining portion of the trust is subject to the provisions of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples in each of which it is assumed that none of the  distributions are accumulation distributions (see sections 665 through  669 and the regulations thereunder):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Trust A, with one income beneficiary, has the following  items of income and deduction without regard to the deduction for  distributions:  Income:</p><p class="depth0">Business income...........................................    $200,000</p><p class="depth0">Investment income.........................................      20,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">220,000</p><p class="depth0">=========== Deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Business deductions (nonpreference).......................     100,000</p><p class="depth0">Investment interest expense...............................      80,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">180,000</p><p class="depth0">Based on the above figures, the trust has $100,000 of taxable income  without regard to items which enter into the computation of excess  investment interest and the deduction for distributions. The trust also  has $60,000 of excess investment interests, resulting in $40,000 of  distributable net income. Thus, $60,000 of the $100,000 of noninvestment  income is not subject to current taxation by reason of the excess  investment interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If $40,000 is distributed to the beneficiary, the beneficiary  will normally be subject to tax on the full amount received and the  ``sheltered'' portion of the income will remain at the trust level.  Thus, none of the excess investment interest item of tax preference is  apportioned to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the beneficiary receives $65,000 from the trust, the  beneficiary is still subject to tax on only $40,000 (the amount of the  distributable net income) and thus, is considered to have received  $25,000 of business income ``sheltered'' by excess investment interest.  Thus, $25,000 of the $60,000 of excess investment interest of the trust  is apportioned to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Trust B has $150,000 of net section 1201 gain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If none of the gain is distributed to the beneficiaries, none of  the capital gains item of tax preference is apportioned to the  beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If all or a part of the gain is distributed to the  beneficiaries, a proportionate part of the capital gains item of tax  preference is apportioned to the beneficiaries. If any of the  beneficiaries are corporations the capital gains item of tax preference  is adjusted in the hands of the corporations as provided in Sec.  1.58- 2(a).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Trust C has taxable income of $200,000 computed without  regard to depreciation on section 1250 property and the deduction for  distributions. The depreciation on section 1250 property held by the  trust is $160,000. The trust instrument provides for income to be  retained by the trust in an amount equal to the depreciation on the  property determined under the straight line method (which method has  been used for this purpose for the entire period the trust has held the  property) which, in this case is equal to $100,000. The $60,000 excess  of the accelerated depreciation of $160,000 over the straight line  amount which would have resulted had the property been depreciated under  that method for the entire period for which the trust has held the  property is an item of tax preference pursuant to section 57(a)(2). Of  the remaining $100,000 of net income of the trust (after the reserve for  depreciation), 80 percent is distributed to the beneficiaries. Pursuant  to sections 167(h) and 642(e), 80 percent of the remaining $60,000 of  depreciation deduction (or $48,000) is taken as a deduction directly by  the beneficiaries and ``shelters'' the income received by the  beneficiaries. Thus, the full $48,000 deduction taken by the  beneficiaries is ``excess accelerated depreciation'' on section 1250  property and is an item of tax preference in the hands of the  beneficiaries. None of the remaining $12,000 of ``excess accelerated  depreciation'' is apportioned to the beneficiaries since this amount  ``shelters'' income retained at the trust level.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. G creates a trust the ordinary income of which is payable  to his adult son.   Ten years from the date of the transfer, corpus is to revert to G. G  retains no other right or power which would cause him to be treated as  an owner under subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J (section 671 and  following). Under the terms of the trust instrument and applicable local  law capital gains must be applied to corpus. During the taxable year  1970 the trust has $200,000 income from dividends and interest and a net  long-term capital gain of $100,000. Since the capital gain is held or  accumulated for future distribution to G, he is treated under section  677(a)(2) as an owner of a portion of the trust to which the gain is  attributable. Therefore, he must include the capital gain in the  computation of his taxable income in 1970 and the capital gain item of  tax preference is treated as being directly received by G. Accordingly,  no adjustment is made to the trust's minimum tax exemption by reason of  the capital gain.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. For its taxable year 1971 the trust referred to in  example (4) has taxable income of $200,000 computed without regard to  depreciation on section 1250 property and the deduction for  distributions. The depreciation on section 1250 property held by the  trust is $160,000. The trust instrument provides for income to be  retained by the trust in an amount equal to the depreciation on the  property determined for purposes of the Federal income tax. If the  property had been depreciated under the straight line method for the  entire period for which the trust held the property the resulting  depreciation deduction would have been $100,000. The $60,000 excess is,  therefore, an item of tax preference pursuant to section 57(a)(2) and  Sec.  1.57-1(d). Since this amount of ``income'' is held or accumulated  for future distributions to G, he is treated under section 677(a)(2) as  an owner of a portion of the trust to which such income is attributable.  Therefore, section 671 requires that in computing the tax liability of  the grantor the income, deductions, and credits against tax of the trust  which are attributable to such portion shall be taken into account.  Thus, the grantor has received $160,000 of income and is entitled to a  depreciation deduction in the same amount. The $60,000 item of tax  preference resulting from the excess depreciation is treated as being  directly received by G as he has directly received the income sheltered  by that preference. Accordingly, no adjustment is made to the trust's  minimum tax exemption by reason of such depreciation.  [T.D. 7564, 43 FR 40482, Sept. 12, 1978]    Sec.  1.58-3T  Treatment of non-alternative tax itemized deductions  by trusts and estates and their beneficiaries in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982 (temporary).</p><p class="depth2">For purposes of section 58(c), in taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1982, itemized deductions of a trust or estate which are  not alternative tax itemized deductions (as defined in section  55(e)(1)), shall be treated as items of tax preference and apportioned  between trusts and their beneficiaries, and estates and their  beneficiaries.
