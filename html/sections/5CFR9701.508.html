                                Sec. 9701.508  Homeland Security Labor Relations Board.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Composition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Homeland Security Labor Relations Board is  composed of at least three members who will be appointed by the  Secretary for terms of 3 years, except that the appointments of the  initial HSLRB members will be for terms of 2, 3, and 4 years,  respectively. The Secretary may extend the term of any member beyond 3  years when necessary to provide for an orderly transition and/or appoint  the member for an additional term. The Secretary, in his or her sole and  exclusive discretion, may appoint additional members to the HSLRB; in so  doing, he or she will make such appointments to ensure that the HSLRB  consists of an odd number of members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Members of the HSLRB must be independent, distinguished citizens  of the United States who are well known for their integrity and  impartiality. Members must have expertise in labor relations, law  enforcement, or national/homeland or other related security matters. At  least one member of the Board must have experience in labor relations.  Members must be able to acquire and maintain an appropriate security  clearance. Members may be removed by the Secretary on the same grounds  as an FLRA member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An individual chosen to fill a vacancy on the HSLRB will be  appointed for the unexpired term of the member who is replaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appointment of the Chair. The Secretary, at his or her sole and  exclusive discretion, will appoint one member to serve as Chair of the  HSLRB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appointment procedures for non-Chair HSLRB members. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  appointments of the two non-Chair HSLRB members will be made by the  Secretary after he or she considers any lists of nominees submitted by  labor organizations that represent employees in the Department of  Homeland Security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The submission of lists of recommended nominees by labor  organizations must be in accordance with timelines and requirements set  forth by the Secretary, who may provide for additional consultation in  order to obtain further information about a recommended nominee. The  ability of the Secretary to appoint HSLRB members may not be delayed or  otherwise affected by the failure of any labor organization to provide a  list of nominees that meets the timeframe and requirements established  by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appointment of additional non-Chair HSLRB members. If the  Secretary determines that additional members are needed, he or she may,  subject to the criteria set forth in paragraph   (a)(2) of this section, appoint the additional members according to the  procedures established by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Filling a HSLRB vacancy. A HSLRB vacancy will be filled  according to the procedure in effect at the time of the appointment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures of the HSLRB. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HSLRB will establish procedures  for the fair, impartial, and expeditious assignment and disposition of  cases. To the extent practicable, the HSLRB will use a single,  integrated process to address all matters associated with a negotiations  dispute, including unfair labor practices, negotiability disputes, and  bargaining impasses. The HSLRB may, pursuant to its regulations, use a  combination of mediation, factfinding, and any other appropriate dispute  resolution method to resolve all such disputes at the earliest  practicable time and with a minimum of process. Such proceedings will be  conducted by the HSLRB, a HSLRB member, or employee of the HSLRB.  Individual HSLRB members may decide a particular dispute. However, at  the motion of a party upon its initial request for HSLRB assistance or  upon the HSLRB's own motion at any time, the full HSLRB (or, where the  Secretary appoints more than three members, a three-person panel of the  HSLRB) may decide a particular dispute involving a matter of first  impression or a major policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where the full HSLRB acts, a vote of the majority of  the HSLRB (or a three-person panel of the HSLRB) will be dispositive. A  vacancy on the HSLRB does not impair the right of the remaining members  to exercise all of the powers of the HSLRB. The vote of the Chair will  be dispositive in the event of a tie.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Finality of HSLRB decisions. Decisions of the HSLRB are final  and binding. However, in cases involving unfair labor practices and/or  negotiability disputes decided by a single member, a party may seek  review of that decision with the full HSLRB, according to rules  prescribed by the HSLRB. In such cases the initial decision is stayed  pending the final decision by the full HSLRB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Review of a HSLRB decision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to obtain judicial  review of a HSLRB decision, a party must request a review of the record  of a HSLRB decision by the Authority by filing such a request in writing  within 15 days after the issuance of the decision. Within 15 days after  the Authority's receipt of the request for a review of the record, any  response must be filed. A party may each submit, and the Authority may  grant for good cause shown, a request for a single extension of time not  to exceed a maximum of 15 additional days. The Authority will establish,  in conjunction with the HSLRB, standards for the sufficiency of the  record and other procedures, including notice to the parties. The  Authority must defer to findings of fact and interpretations of this  part made by the HSLRB and sustain the HSLRB's decision unless the  requesting party shows that the HSLRB's decision was--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not  in accordance with law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Based on error in applying the HSLRB's procedures that resulted  in substantial prejudice to a party affecting the outcome; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unsupported by substantial evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Authority must complete its review of the record and issue a  final decision within 30 days after receiving the party's timely  response to such request for review. This 30-day time limit is  mandatory, except that the Authority may extend its time for review by a  maximum of 15 additional days if it determines that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The case is unusually complex; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An extension is necessary to prevent any prejudice to the  parties that would otherwise result.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No extension beyond that provided by paragraph (h)(2) of this  section is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Authority does not issue a final decision within the  mandatory time limit established by paragraph (h) of this section, the  Authority will be considered to have denied the request for review of  the HSLRB's decision, which will constitute a final decision of the  Authority and is subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C.  7123.</p>
