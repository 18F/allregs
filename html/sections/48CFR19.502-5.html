Partial small business set-asides may be conducted using sealed bids (see part 14), or competitive proposals (see part 15).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for offers on the non-set-aside portion of partial set-asides, offers received from concerns that do not qualify as small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected. However, before rejecting an offer otherwise eligible for award because of questions concerning the size representation, an SBA determination must be obtained (see subpart 19.3).
