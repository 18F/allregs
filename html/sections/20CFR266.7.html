                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A representative payee is accountable for the use of benefits.  The Board will require periodic written reports from representative  payees. The Board may also, at the Board's option, verify how a  representative payee used benefit payments. A representative payee must  keep records of what was done with all benefit payments in order to make  accounting reports. The Board may ask the following questions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of benefit payments on hand at the beginning of the  accounting period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How the benefit payments were used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> How much of the benefit payments were saved and how the savings  were invested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the annuitant lived during the accounting period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount of the annuitant's income from other sources during  the accounting period. The Board may ask for information about other  funds to enable the Board to evaluate the use of benefit payments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the representative payee has been convicted of a felony  or misdemeanor offense under the statutes administered by the Board or  by the Social Security Administration within the past 15 years or  whether any such charges are pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An individual to whom payments are certified as representative  payee on behalf of an annuitant shall submit a written report in such  form and at such times as the Board may require, accounting for the  payments certified to him or her on behalf of the annuitant. If,  however, such payee is a court-appointed fiduciary and, as such, is  required to make an annual accounting to the court, a true copy of each  such account filed with the court may be submitted in lieu of the  accounting form prescribed by the Board. If any representative payee  fails to submit the required accounting within a reasonable period of  time after it is requested, no further payments shall be made to him or  her on behalf of the annuitant unless for good cause shown, the default  of the representative payee is excused by the Board, and the required  accounting is thereafter submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At any time after the Board has selected a representative payee,  the Board may ask such payee to submit information showing a continuing  relationship to the annuitant and a continuing responsibility for the  care of the annuitant. If the representative payee does not give the  Board the requested information within a reasonable period of time, the  Board may stop paying such payee unless the Board determines that the  payee had a good reason for not complying with the Board's request, and  the Board receives the information requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where, pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the  Board suspends payments, such suspension shall not exceed a period of 30  days; thereafter, the payments will be made to the annuitant except  where the annuitant is an unemancipated minor under age 18 or where in  the Board's judgment the interests of the annuitant would not be served  by releasing payment to the annuitant.
