                            <p class="depth0">When none of the instruments described in Sec. 1780.87 are legally permissible or practical, a bond anticipation note or similar temporary debt instrument may be used. The debt instrument will provide for multiple advances of Agency funds and will be for the full amount of the Agency loan. The instrument will be prepared by bond counsel, or local counsel if bond counsel is not involved, and approved by the State program official and OGC. At the same time the Agency delivers the last advance, the borrower will deliver the permanent bond instrument and the canceled temporary instrument will be returned to the borrower. The approved debt instrument will show at least the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The date from which each advance will bear interest;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The interest rate as determined by Sec. 1780.13;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A payment schedule providing for interest on outstanding principal at least annually; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A maturity date which shall be no earlier than the anticipated issuance date of the permanent instruments and no longer than the 40-year statutory limit.
