                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where air pipes to ballast and other tanks extend above the  freeboard or superstructure decks, the exposed parts of the pipes shall  be of substantial construction; the height from the deck to the point  where water may have access below shall be at least 30 inches on the  freeboard deck and 17\1/2\ inches on the superstructure deck. Where  these heights may interfere with the working of the vessel, a lower  height may be approved, provided the assigning authority is satisfied  that the closing arrangements and other circumstances justify a lower  height.   Satisfactory means permanently attached, shall be provided for closing  the openings of the air pipes.
