Vessels may be moored any place  outside the navigation channel in this reach in case of an emergency and  then for only the minimum time required to terminate the emergency. When  so moored, all vessels shall be securely tied with bow and stern lines  of sufficient strength and fastenings to withstand currents, winds, wave  action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which might  cause the vessels to break their moorings. When vessels are so moored, a  guard shall be on board at all times to ensure that proper signals are  displayed and that the vessels are securely and adequately moored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessels may be moored any time at facilities constructed in  accordance with an approved navigation permit or as authorized by the  District Commander. When so moored, each vessel shall have sufficient  fastenings to prevent the vessels from breaking loose by wind, current,  wave action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which  might cause the vessel to break its mooring. The number of vessels in  one fleet and the width of the fleet of vessels tied abreast shall not  extend into the fairway or be greater than allowed under the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mariners should report immediately by radio or fastest available  means to the lockmaster at Old River Lock or to any government patrol or  survey boat in the vicinity any emergency mooring or vessels drifting  uncontrolled within the area described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. It is the responsibility and duty of the master of a towing  vessel releasing or mooring a vessel in this reach of the Mississippi  River to report such action immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mooring on Mississippi River below Baton Rouge, La., including  South and Southwest Passes. (1) When tied up individually or in fleets,  vessels shall be moored with sufficient lines and shore fastenings to  insure their remaining in place and withstanding the action of winds,  currents and the suction of passing vessels.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this  section in 33 CFR Part 207.
