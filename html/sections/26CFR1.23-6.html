                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedures for additions to the list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources--(1) In general. A manufacturer of an item (or a group of manufacturers) desiring to apply for addition to the approved list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(viii) or (e)(2) of Sec.  1.23-2 shall submit an application to the Internal Revenue Service, Attention: Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), CC:C:E, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224. The term ``manufacturer'' includes a person who assembles an item or a system from components manufactured by other persons. The application shall provide the information required under paragraph (b) of this section. An application may request that more than one item be added to the approved list. It will be the responsibility of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical) upon receipt of the application to determine whether all the information required under paragraph (b) of this section has been furnished with the application. If an application lacks essential information, the applicant will be advised of the additional information required. If the information (or a reasonable explanation of the reason why the information cannot be made available) is not forthcoming within 30 days of the date of that advice, the application will be closed and the applicant will be so informed. Any resubmission of information beyond the 30-day period will be treated as a new application. If the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical) already is considering an application with respect to the same or a similar item, it may consolidate applications. The Office of the Associate Chief Counsel will make a report and recommendation to the ad hoc advisory board as to whether each item that is the subject to an application should be added in accordance with the manufacturer's request to the approved list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources in light of the applicable criteria provided in paragraph (c) and the standards for Secretarial determination provided in paragraph (d) of this section. In making this recommendation, the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel shall consult with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (or their delegates) and any other appropriate Federal officers to obtain their views concerning the item in question. In addition, the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel may request from the manufacturer clarification of information submitted with the application. The Office of the Associate Chief Counsel shall report its recommendation and forward the application to the ad hoc advisory board for further consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Upon being advised in writing that an adverse recommendation or decision as to any item that is the subject of an application is contemplated, a manufacturer may request a conference. The conference must be held within 21 calendar days from the mailing of that advice. Procedures for requesting an extension of the 21-day period and notifying the manufacturer of the recommendation or decision with respect to that request are the same as those applicable to conferences on ruling requests by taxpayers. The applicant is entitled to only one conference. There is no right to another conference when a favorable recommendation or decision is reversed at a higher level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A report of any application which has been denied during the preceding month and the reasons for the denial shall be published each month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contents of application. The application by the manufacturer shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A description of the item and the generic class to which it belongs, including any features relating to safe installation and use of the item. This description shall include appropriate design drawings and technical specifications (or representative drawings and specifications when application by a group of manufacturers).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An explanation of the purpose, function, and each recommended use of the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An estimate (and explanation of the estimation methods employed and the assumptions made) of the total number of units that would be sold for each recommended use during the first 4 years following the addition of the item to the approved list and of the total number that would be sold for each recommended use during that period in the absence of addition. If the item is sold in more than one size, the estimate shall indicate the projected sales for each size. This estimate shall reflect total industry sales of the item. Past industry sales information for each recommended use for the previous two years shall also be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether sufficient capacity is available to increase production to meet any increase in demand for the item, or for associated fuels and materials, caused by such addition. This determination shall be based on industry-wide data and not just the manufacturing capability of the applicant. If the applicant has the exclusive right to manufacture the item, this information shall also be provided in the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An estimate (including estimation methods and assumptions) of the energy in Btu's of oil and natural gas used directly or indirectly per unit by the applicant in the manufacture of the item and other items necessary for its use, the type of energy source (e.g., oil, natural gas, coal, electricity), and the extent of its use in the manufacturing process of the item. The applicant must also provide a list of the major components of the item and their composition and weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Test data and experience data (where experience data is available) to substantiate for each recommended use the energy savings in Btu's that are claimed will be achieved by one unit during a period of one year. The data shall be obtained by controlled tests in which, if possible, the addition of the item is the only variable. If the item may be sold in various configurations, data shall be provided with respect to energy savings from each configuration with significantly different energy use characteristics. Test methods are to conform to recognized industry or government standards. This determination shall take into account the seasonal use of the item. If the energy savings of the item varies with climatic conditions, data shall be provided with respect to each climate zone. The applicant may use the Department of Energy's climatic zones for heating and

cooling (see Sec.  450.35 of 10 CFR part 450 (1980)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The impact of increased demand on the price of the item and the energy source used by the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The energy source which will be replaced or conserved by the item, and, in the case of a request for addition to the approved list of renewable energy sources, data establishing that the energy source is inexhaustible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Data to show the total estimated savings of energy in Btu's attributable to reduced consumption of oil or natural gas whether directly or indirectly from use of the item, including assumptions underlying this estimate. If the consumption of both oil and natural gas will be reduced, data to show the energy savings in Btu's attributable to each shall be provided. The estimate is to be based on energy savings in Btu's per unit determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section for the first four years of the useful life of the item and is to take into account only the additional units of the item estimated to be placed in service as a result of the addition using data obtained under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If the item will result in reduction of oil or natural gas consumption by replacing an item which uses such an energy source, the application shall indicate the item replaced and the extent to which this reduction will occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Geographical information if required under paragraph (b)(6) of this section to show the climatic zones of the country where the item is expected to be used, including an estimate of the total number of additional units to be placed in service during the first 4 years following the addition of the item in the area as a result of the addition of the item to the list of qualifying items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The retail cost of the item (or items if the item is sold in more than one size) including all installation costs necessary for safe and effective use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Whether the item is designed for residential use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The estimated useful life of the item and associated equipment necessary for its use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> The type and amount of waste and emissions in weight per unit of energy saved resulting from use of the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> If the item might reasonably be suspected of presenting any health or safety hazard, test data to show that the item does not present such hazard.
With respect to applications for addition to the approved list of renewable energy sources, the term ``item'' as used in this paragraph refers to the property which uses the energy source and not the energy source itself. The application should clearly indicate whether the request is for addition to the approved list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources, identify the provisions for which data is being submitted, and present the data in the order requested. The tests required under this paragraph may be conducted by independent laboratories but the underlying data must be submitted along with the test results. There shall accompany the request a declaration in the following form: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this application, including accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts presented in support of the application are true, correct and complete.'' The statement must be signed by the person or persons making the application. The declaration shall not be made by the taxpayer's representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for additions--(1) Additions to the approved list of energy-conserving components. For an item to be considered for addition to the approved list of energy-conserving components, the manufacturer must show that the item increases the energy efficiency of a dwelling. For an item to be considered as increasing the energy efficiency of a dwelling, all of the following criteria must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Additions to the approved list of energy-conserving components.

The Secretary will not make any addition to the approved list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources unless the Secretary determines that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There will be a reduction in the total consumption of oil or natural gas as a result of the addition, and that reduction is sufficient to justify any resulting decrease in Federal revenues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The addition will not result in an increased use of any item which is known to be, or reasonably suspected to be, environmentally hazardous or a threat to public health or safety, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Available Federal subsidies do not make the addition unnecessary or inappropriate (in the light of the most advantageous allocation of economic resources).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Factors taken into account. In making any determination under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Make an estimate of the amount by which the addition will reduce oil and natural gas consumption, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine whether the addition compares favorably, on the basis of the reduction in oil and natural gas consumption per dollar of cost to the Federal Government (including revenue loss), with other Federal programs in existence or being proposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Factors taken into account in making estimates. In making any estimate under subparagraph (2)(i), the Secretary will take into account (among other factors)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which the use of any item will be increased as a result of the addition,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether sufficient capacity is available to increase production to meet any increase in demand for the item or associated fuels and materials caused by the addition,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of oil and natural gas used directly or indirectly in the manufacture of the item and other items necessary for its use,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The estimated useful life of the item, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The extent additional use of the item leads, directly or indirectly, to the reduced use of oil or natural gas. Indirect uses of oil or natural gas include use of electricity derived from oil or natural gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date of addition to approved lists. In the case of additions to the approved list of energy-conserving components or renewable energy sources, the credit allowable by Sec.  1.23-1 shall apply with respect to expenditures which are made on or after the date a Treasury decision amending the regulations pursuant to the application is published in the Federal Register. However, the Secretary may prescribe by regulations that expenditures for additions made on or after the date referred to in the preceding sentence and before the close of the taxable year in which such date occurs shall be taken into account in the following taxable year. Additions to the list will be subject to the performance and quality standards (if any) provided under Sec.  1.23-4 which are in effect at the time of the addition. Furthermore, any addition made to the approved list will be subject to reevaluation by the Secretary

for the purpose of determining whether the item still meets the requisite criteria and standards for addition to the list. If it is determined by the Secretary that an item no longer meets the requisite criteria, the Secretary will amend the regulations to delete the item from the approved list. Removal of an item from the list will be prospective from the date a Treasury decision amending the regulations is published in the Federal Register.

Sec.  1.25-2T  Amount of credit (Temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided, the amount of the credit allowable for any taxable year to an individual who holds a qualified mortgage credit certificate is equal to the product of the certificate credit rate (as defined in paragraph (b)) and the amount of the interest paid or accrued by the taxpayer during the taxable year on the certified indebtedness amount (as defined in paragraph (c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certificate credit rate--(1) In general. For purposes of Sec. Sec.  1.25-1T through 1.25-8T, the term ``certificate credit rate'' means the rate specified by the issuer on the mortgage credit certificate. The certificate credit rate shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of Sec. Sec.  1.25-1T through 1.25-8T, the term ``certificate credit rate'' means the rate specified by the issuer on the mortgage credit certificate. The certificate credit rate shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation in certain States. (i) In the case of a State which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a State which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has a State ceiling for the calendar year in which an election is made that exceeds 20 percent of the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family owner-occupied residences located within the jurisdiction of such State, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Issued qualified mortgage bonds in an aggregate amount less than $150 million for calendar year 1983.
the certificate credit rate for any mortgage credit certificate issued under such program shall not exceed 20 percent unless the issuing authority submits a plan to the Commissioner to ensure that the weighted average of the certificate credit rates in such mortgage credit certificate program does not exceed 20 percent and the Commissioner approves such plan. For purposes of determining the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family owner-occupied residences located within the jurisdiction of such State, an issuer may rely upon the amount published by the Treasury Department for such calendar years. An issuer may rely on a different amount from that safe-harbor limitation where the issuer has made a more accurate and comprehensive determination of that amount. The weighted

average of the certificate credit rates in a mortgage credit certificate program is determined by dividing the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the certificate credit rate of each certificate by the certified indebtedness amount with respect to that certificate by the sum of the certified indebtedness amounts of the certificates issued. See section 103A(g) and the regulations thereunder for the definition of the term ``State ceiling''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example. City Z issues four qualified mortgage credit certificates pursuant to its qualified mortgage credit certificate program. H receives a certificate with a certificate credit rate of 30 percent and a certified indebtedness amount of $50,000. I receives a certificate with a certificate credit rate of 25 percent and a certified indebtedness amount of $100,000. J and K each receive certificates with certificate credit rates of 10 percent; their certified indebtedness amounts are $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. The weighted average of the certificate credit rates is determined by dividing the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the certificate credit rate of each certificate by the certified indebtedness amount with respect to that certificate ((.3x$50,000) + (.25x$100,000) + (.1x$50,000) + (.1x$100,000)) by the sum of the certified indebtedness amounts of the certificates issued ($50,000+$100,000+$50,000+$100,000). Thus, the weighted average of the certificate credit rates is 18.33 percent ($55,000/$300,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certified indebtedness amount--(1) In general.

The term ``certified indebtedness amount'' means the amount of indebtedness which is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incurred by the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To acquire his principal residence, Sec.  1.25-2T(c)(1)(i),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As a qualified home improvement loan, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> As a qualified rehabilitation loan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specified in the mortgage credit certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On March 1, 1986, State X, pursuant to its qualified mortgage credit certificate program, provides a mortgage credit certificate to B. State X specifies that the maximum amount of the mortgage loan for which B may claim a credit is $65,000. On March 15, B purchases for $67,000 a single-family dwelling for use as his principal residence. B obtains from Bank M a mortgage loan for $60,000. State X, or Bank M acting on behalf of State X, indicates on B's mortgage credit certificate that the certified indebtedness amount of B's loan is $60,000. B may claim a credit under section 25 (e) based on this amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on credit--(1) Limitation where certificate credit rate exceeds 20 percent. (i) If the certificate credit rate of any mortgage credit certificate exceeds 20 percent, the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer by section 25(a)(1) for any year shall not exceed $2,000. Any amount denied under this paragraph (d)(1) may not be carried forward under section 25(e)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Limitation where certificate credit rate exceeds 20 percent. (i) If the certificate credit rate of any mortgage credit certificate exceeds 20 percent, the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer by section 25(a)(1) for any year shall not exceed $2,000. Any amount denied under this paragraph (d)(1) may not be carried forward under section 25(e)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the certificate credit rate of any mortgage credit certificate exceeds 20 percent, the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer by section 25(a)(1) for any year shall not exceed $2,000. Any amount denied under this paragraph (d)(1) may not be carried forward under section 25(e)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If two or more persons hold interests in any residence, the limitation of paragraph (d)(1)(i) shall be allocated among such persons in proporation to their respective interests in the residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryforward of unused credit. (i) If the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T for any taxable year exceeds the applicable tax limit for that year, the excess (the ``unused credit'') will be a carryover to each of the 3 succeeding taxable years and, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(2)(ii), will be added to the credit allowable by section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T for that succeeding year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T for any taxable year exceeds the applicable tax limit for that year, the excess (the ``unused credit'') will be a carryover to each of the 3 succeeding taxable years and, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(2)(ii), will be added to the credit allowable by section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T for that succeeding year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the unused credit for any taxable year (the ``unused credit year'') which may be taken into account under this paragraph (d)(2) for any subsequent taxable year may not exceed the amount by which the applicable tax limit for that subsequent taxable year exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-1T for the current taxable year, and (B) the sum of the unused credits which, by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), are carried to that subsequent taxable year and are attributable to taxable years before the unused credit year. Thus, if by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), unused credits from 2 prior taxable years are carried forward to a subsequent taxable year, the unused credit from the earlier of those 2 prior years must be taken into account before the unused credit from the later of those 2 years is taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) the term ``applicable tax limit'' means the limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for the taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable for that year under section 21, relating to expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment, section 22, relating to the credit for the elderly and the permanently disabled, section 23, relating to the residential energy credit, and section 24, relating to contributions to candidates for public office. The limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for any taxable year is equal to the taxpayer's tax liability (as defined in section 26 (b)) for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B, a calendar year taxpayer, holds a qualified mortgage credit certificate. For 1986 B's applicable tax limit (i.e., tax liability) is $1,100. The amount of the credit under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T for 1986 is $1,700. For 1986 B is not entitled to any of the credits described in sections 21 through 24. Under Sec.  1.25-2T (d)(2), B's unused credit for 1986 is $600, and B is entitled to carry forward that amount to the 3 succeeding years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 1987 B's applicable tax limit is $1,500, the amount of the credit under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T is $1,700, and the unused credit is $200. For 1988 B's applicable tax limit is $2,000, the amount of the credit under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T is $1,300, and there is no unused credit. For 1987 and 1988 B is not entitled to any of the credits described in sections 21 through 24. No portion of the unused credit for 1986 my be used in 1987. For 1988 B is entitled to claim a credit of $2,000 under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T, consisting of a $1,300 credit for 1988, the $600 unused credit for 1986, and $100 of the $200 unused credit for 1987. In addition, B may carry forward the remaining unused credit for 1987 ($100) to 1989 and 1990.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that for 1988 B is entitled to a credit of $400 under section 23. B's applicable tax limit for 1988 is $1,600 ($2,000 less $400). For 1988 B is entitled to claim a credit of $1,600 under section 25 (a) and Sec.  1.25-2T, consisting of a $1,300 credit for 1988 and $300 of the unused credit for 1986. In addition, B may carry forward the remaining unused credits of $300 for 1986 to 1989 and of $200 for 1987 to 1989 and 1990.
