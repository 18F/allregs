The manufacturer shall use only deterioration  factors from engine families previously certified by the manufacturer  and the deterioration factors shall not be included in the calculation  more than once. The deterioration factors for each pollutant shall be  calculated separately. The manufacturer may, at its option, limit the  deterioration factors used in the calculation of the manufacturer's  minimum deterioration factors to those from all similar systems to the  system being certified if sufficient data (i.e., from at least two  certified systems) exists. All data eligible to be grouped as similar  system data shall be used in calculating similar system deterioration  factors.

The sales projections are to be based on total sales projected for each  engine/system combination. The durability programs applicable to such  manufacturers for this purpose shall be the Standard AMA, the Production  AMA and the Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Programs of  Sec. 86.094-13. The durability data vehicle (engine) mileage  accumulation and emission tests are to be conducted in accordance with  Sec. 86.094-13. The manufacturer must develop deterioration factors by  generating durability data in accordance with Sec. 86.094-13 on a  minimum of 25 percent of the manufacturer's projected sales (by engine/ system combination) that is equipped with unproven emission control  systems. The manufacturer must complete the 25 percent durability  requirement before the remainder of the manufacturer's sales equipped  with unproven emission control systems is certified using manufacturer- determined assigned deterioration factors. Alternatively, any of these  manufacturers may, at their option, accumulate miles on durability data  vehicles and complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing  their own deterioration factors on the remaining sales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 86.094-24(d) and (e) are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Section 86.094-25 is applicable to maintenance performed on  durability data light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty  vehicles, and heavy-duty engines when the manufacturer completes  durability data vehicles or engines; Sec. 86.087-38 is applicable to the  recommended maintenance the manufacturer includes in the maintenance  instructions furnished the purchasers of new motor vehicles and new  motor vehicle engines under Sec. 86.087-38.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 86.094-26 is applicable if the manufacturer completes  durability data vehicles or engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 86.090-27 is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Sections 86.094-28 and 86.091-29 are applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 86.094-30 is applicable, except for Sec. 86.094-30  (a)(2) and (b).
