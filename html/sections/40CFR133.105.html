All requirements for the specified parameters in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall be achieved except as provided for in Sec. 133.103, or paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> BOD5.

Except as limited by paragraph (f) of this section, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Regional Administrator, or, if appropriate, State Director subject to EPA approval, is authorized to adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for trickling filter facilities and in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for waste stabilization pond facilities, to conform to the BOD5 and SS effluent concentrations consistently achievable through proper operation and maintenance (Sec. 133.101(f)) by the median (50th percentile) facility in a representative sample of facilities within a State or appropriate contiguous geographical area that meet the definition of facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (Sec. 133.101(g)).

Sec. 133.105(a)(1), 133.105(a)(2) and 133.105(a)(3), on a case-by-case basis provided that the levels of CBOD5 effluent quality are not less stringent than the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The 30-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 7-days average shall not exceed 60 mg/l.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where data are available, the parameter CBOD5 may be used for effluent quality limitations established under paragraph (d) of this section.

Any permit adjustment made pursuant to this part may not be any less stringent than the limitations required pursuant to Sec. 133.105(a)-(e). Furthermore, permitting authorities shall require more stringent limitations when adjusting permits if: (1) For existing facilities the permitting authority determines that the 30-day average and 7-day average BOD5 and SS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works, based on an analysis of the past performance of the treatment works, would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For new facilities, the permitting authority determines that the 30-day average and 7-day average BOD5 and SS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works, considering the design capability of the treatment process and geographical and climatic conditions, would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations.
