their campuses in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students provided to any other employer, or access to student-recruiting information. The term ``equal in quality and scope'' means the same access to campus and students provided by the school to the any other nonmilitary recruiters or employers receiving the most favorable access. The focus is not on the content of a school's recruiting policy, but instead on the result achieved by the policy and compares the access provided military recruiters to that provided other recruiters. Therefore, it is insufficient to comply with the statute (10 U.S.C. 983) if the policy results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Updates policy and responsibilities relating to the management of covered schools that have an anti-ROTC policy.</p>
