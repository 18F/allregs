                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">By statute, appropriate employment service delivery systems are  required to refer qualified protected veterans to fill employment  openings listed by contractors with such appropriate employment delivery  systems pursuant to the mandatory job listing requirements of the equal  opportunity clause and are required to give priority to protected  veterans in making such referrals. The employment service delivery  systems shall provide OFCCP, upon request, information pertinent to  whether the contractor is in compliance with the mandatory job listing  requirements of the equal opportunity clause.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 60-300--Guidelines on a Contractor's Duty To</p><p class="depth0">Provide Reasonable Accommodation</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines in this appendix are in large part derived from, and  are consistent with, the discussion regarding the duty to provide  reasonable accommodation contained in the Interpretive Guidance on Title  I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) set out as an appendix to  the regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC) implementing the ADA (29 CFR part 1630). Although the following  discussion is intended to provide an independent ``free-standing''  source of guidance with respect to the duty to provide reasonable  accommodation under this part, to the extent that the EEOC appendix  provides additional guidance which is consistent with the following  discussion, it may be relied upon for purposes of this part as well. See  Sec. 60-300.1(c). Contractors are obligated to provide reasonable  accommodation and to take affirmative action. Reasonable accommodation  under VEVRAA, like reasonable accommodation required under section 503  and the ADA, is a part of the nondiscrimination obligation. See EEOC  appendix cited in this paragraph. Affirmative action is unique to VEVRAA  and section 503, and includes actions above and beyond those required as  a matter of nondiscrimination. An example of this is the requirement  discussed in paragraph 2 of this appendix that a contractor shall make  an inquiry of a disabled veteran who is having significant difficulty  performing his or her job.</p><p class="depth0">1. A contractor is required to make reasonable accommodations to the  known physical or mental limitations of an ``otherwise qualified''  disabled veteran, unless the contractor can demonstrate that the  accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its  business. As stated in Sec. 60-300.2(s), a disabled veteran is  qualified if he or she has the ability to perform the essential  functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation. A  contractor is required to make a reasonable accommodation with respect  to its application process if the disabled veteran is qualified with  respect to that process. One is ``otherwise qualified'' if he or she is  qualified for a job, except that, because of a disability, he or she  needs a reasonable accommodation to be able to perform the job's  essential functions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Although the contractor would not be expected to accommodate  disabilities of which it is unaware, the contractor has an affirmative  obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation for applicants and  employees who are known to be disabled veterans. As stated in Sec. 60- 300.42(b) (see also Appendix B of this part), the contractor is required  to invite applicants who have been provided an offer of employment,  before they are placed on the contractor's payroll, to indicate whether  they are a disabled veteran who may be protected by the Act. Section 60- 300.42(d) further provides that the contractor must seek the advice of  disabled veterans who ``self-identify'' in this way as to reasonable  accommodation. Moreover, Sec. 60-300.44(d) provides that if an employee  who is a known disabled veteran is having significant difficulty  performing his or her job and it is reasonable to conclude that the  performance problem may be related to the disability, the contractor is  required to confidentially inquire whether the problem is disability  related and if the employee is in need of a reasonable accommodation.</p><p class="depth0">3. An accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the  way things are customarily done that enables a disabled veteran to enjoy  equal employment opportunities. Equal employment opportunity means an  opportunity to attain the same level of performance, or to enjoy the  same level of benefits and privileges of employment, as are available to  the average similarly situated employee without a disability. Thus, for  example, an accommodation made to assist an employee who is a disabled  veteran in the performance of his or her job must be adequate to enable  the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. The  accommodation, however, does not   have to be the ``best'' accommodation possible, so long as it is  sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being  accommodated. There are three areas in which reasonable accommodations  may be necessary: (1) accommodations in the application process; (2)  accommodations that enable employees who are disabled veterans to  perform the essential functions of the position held or desired; and (3)  accommodations that enable employees who are disabled veterans to enjoy  equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by employees  without disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">4. The term ``undue hardship'' refers to any accommodation that  would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial, or disruptive, or that  would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the contractor's  business. The contractor's claim that the cost of a particular  accommodation will impose an undue hardship requires a determination of  which financial resources should be considered--those of the contractor  in its entirety or only those of the facility that will be required to  provide the accommodation. This inquiry requires an analysis of the  financial relationship between the contractor and the facility in order  to determine what resources will be available to the facility in  providing the accommodation. If the contractor can show that the cost of  the accommodation would impose an undue hardship, it would still be  required to provide the accommodation if the funding is available from  another source, e.g., the Department of Veterans Affairs or a state  vocational rehabilitation agency, or if Federal, state or local tax  deductions or tax credits are available to offset the cost of the  accommodation. In the absence of such funding, the disabled veteran must  be given the option of providing the accommodation or of paying that  portion of the cost which constitutes the undue hardship on the  operation of the business.</p><p class="depth0">5. The definition for ``reasonable accommodation'' in Sec. 60- 300.2(t) lists a number of examples of the most common types of  accommodations that the contractor may be required to provide. There are  any number of specific accommodations that may be appropriate for  particular situations. The discussion in this appendix is not intended  to provide an exhaustive list of required accommodations (as no such  list would be feasible); rather, it is intended to provide general  guidance regarding the nature of the obligation. The decision as to  whether a reasonable accommodation is appropriate must be made on a  case-by-case basis. The contractor must consult with the disabled  veteran in deciding on the reasonable accommodation; frequently, the  individual will know exactly what accommodation he or she will need to  perform successfully in a particular job, and may suggest an  accommodation which is simpler and less expensive than the accommodation  the contractor might have devised. Other resources to consult include  the appropriate state vocational rehabilitation services agency, the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (1-800-669-4000 (voice), 1-800- 669-6820 (TTY)), the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) operated by the  Office of Disability Employment Policy in the U.S. Department of Labor  (1-800-526-7234 or 1-800-232-9675), private disability organizations  (including those that serve veterans), and other employers.</p><p class="depth0">6. With respect to accommodations that can permit an employee who is  a disabled veteran to perform essential functions successfully, a  reasonable accommodation may require the contractor to, for instance,  modify or acquire equipment. For the visually-impaired, such  accommodations may include providing adaptive hardware and software for  computers, electronic visual aids, Braille devices, talking calculators,  magnifiers, audio recordings and Braille or large-print materials. For  persons with hearing impairments, reasonable accommodations may include  providing telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with  hearing aids and text telephones (TTYs). For persons with limited  physical dexterity, the obligation may require the provision of  telephone headsets, speech activated software and raised or lowered  furniture.</p><p class="depth0">7. Other reasonable accommodations of this type may include  providing personal assistants such as a reader, sign language  interpreter or travel attendant, permitting the use of accrued paid  leave or providing additional unpaid leave for necessary treatment. The  contractor may also be required to make existing facilities readily  accessible to and usable by disabled veterans--including areas used by  employees for purposes other than the performance of essential job  functions such as restrooms, break rooms, cafeterias, lounges,  auditoriums, libraries, parking lots and credit unions. This type of  accommodation will enable employees to enjoy equal benefits and  privileges of employment as are enjoyed by employees who do not have  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">8. Another of the potential accommodations listed in Sec. 60- 300.2(t) is job restructuring. This may involve reallocating or  redistributing those nonessential, marginal job functions which a  qualified disabled veteran cannot perform to another position.  Accordingly, if a clerical employee who is a disabled veteran is  occasionally required to lift heavy boxes containing files, but cannot  do so because of a disability, this task may be reassigned to another  employee. The contractor, however, is not required to reallocate  essential functions, i.e., those functions that the individual who holds  the job would have to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation,  in order to be considered qualified for the position. For instance, the   contractor which has a security guard position which requires the  incumbent to inspect identity cards would not have to provide a blind  disabled veteran with an assistant to perform that duty; in such a case,  the assistant would be performing an essential function of the job for  the disabled veteran. Job restructuring may also involve allowing part- time or modified work schedules. For instance, flexible or adjusted work  schedules could benefit disabled veterans who cannot work a standard  schedule because of the need to obtain medical treatment, or disabled  veterans with mobility impairments who depend on a public transportation  system that is not accessible during the hours of a standard schedule.</p><p class="depth0">9. Reasonable accommodation may also include reassignment to a  vacant position. In general, reassignment should be considered only when  accommodation within the disabled veteran's current position would pose  an undue hardship. Reassignment is not required for applicants. However,  in making hiring decisions, contractors are encouraged to consider  applicants who are known disabled veterans for all available positions  for which they may be qualified when the position(s) applied for is  unavailable. Reassignment may not be used to limit, segregate, or  otherwise discriminate against employees who are disabled veterans by  forcing reassignments to undesirable positions or to designated offices  or facilities. Employers should reassign the individual to an equivalent  position in terms of pay, status, etc., if the individual is qualified,  and if the position is vacant within a reasonable amount of time. A  ``reasonable amount of time'' must be determined in light of the  totality of the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">10. The contractor may reassign an individual to a lower graded  position if there are no accommodations that would enable the employee  to remain in the current position and there are no vacant equivalent  positions for which the individual is qualified with or without  reasonable accommodation. The contractor may maintain the reassigned  disabled veteran at the salary of the higher graded position, and must  do so if it maintains the salary of reassigned employees who are not  disabled veterans. It should also be noted that the contractor is not  required to promote a disabled veteran as an accommodation.</p><p class="depth0">11. With respect to the application process, reasonable  accommodations may include the following: (1) providing information  regarding job vacancies in a form accessible to disabled veterans who  are vision or hearing impaired, e.g., by making an announcement  available in braille, in large print, or on computer disc, or by  responding to job inquiries via TTYs; (2) providing readers, sign  language interpreters and other similar assistance during the  application, testing and interview process; (3) appropriately adjusting  or modifying employment-related examinations, e.g., extending regular  time deadlines, allowing a disabled veteran who is blind or has a  learning disorder such as dyslexia to provide oral answers for a written  test, and permitting an applicant, regardless of the nature of his or  her ability, to demonstrate skills through alternative techniques and  utilization of adapted tools, aids and devices; and (4) ensuring a  disabled veteran with a mobility impairment full access to testing  locations such that the applicant's test scores accurately reflect the  applicant's skills or aptitude rather than the applicant's mobility  impairment.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
