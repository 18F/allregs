If your lease contains a well that is capable of production,  but you fail to produce the oil or gas due to circumstances beyond your  control, you may apply for a suspension under Sec. 3135.2. If the BLM  approves the suspension, the lease will not expire on the 30th  anniversary of the original issuance date of the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A lease may be maintained in force by the BLM-approved  directional wells drilled under the leased area from surface locations  on adjacent or adjoining lands not covered by the lease. In such  circumstances, drilling shall be considered to have commenced on the  lease area when drilling is commenced on the adjacent or adjoining lands  for the purpose of directional drilling under the leased area through  any directional well surfaced on adjacent or adjoining lands.  Production, drilling or   reworking of any such directional well shall be considered production or  drilling or reworking operations on the lease area for all purposes of  the lease.
