                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applying for competitive contract renewal. When you have paid the United States the full contract price for the mineral materials you purchased under a competitive contract, you may apply for renewal of the contract without further competitive bidding in order to purchase and extract additional material that may be available at the contract site. You must submit your request for renewal of the contract at least 90 days before it expires. You do not need to use a specific form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BLM's response to the application.

BLM will renew your contract for a maximum term of 10 additional years.

There is no maximum number of times BLM may renew a contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fee. BLM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis as described in Sec. 3000.11 of this chapter.
