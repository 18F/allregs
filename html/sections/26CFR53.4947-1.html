Also for purposes of this section  and Sec. 53.4947-2, the term ``purposes described in section  170(c)(2)(B)'' shall be treated as including purposes described in  section 170(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> when a charitable trust seeks an exemption from  taxation under section 501(a), a charitable trust (as defined in this  paragraph) shall be considered organized on the day it first becomes  subject to section 4947(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. However, for purposes of the special and  transistional rules in section 4940(c)(4)(B), 4942(f)(4),  4943(c)(4)(A)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> and (B) and section 101(1)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (D),  and (1)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, a charitable trust (as defined  in this paragraph) shall be considered organized on the first day it has  amounts in trust for which a deduction was allowed (within the meaning  of paragraph (a) of this section) under section 170, 545(b)(2),  556(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522. Thus, under this rule, a  trust may be treated as a private foundation in existence on a date  governing one of the applicable special and transistional rules even  though the trust did not otherwise become subject to the provisions of  Chapter 42 until a later date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. On January 30, 1970, X creates an inter vivos trust under  which M receives 50 percent and N receives 50 percent of the trust's  income for 10 years, and upon the termination of which, at the end of  the 10-year period, the corpus is to be distributed to O. M, N and O are  all organizations described in section 501(c)(3) and X is allowed a  deduction under section 170 for the value of all interests placed in  trust. The trustees of the trust do not give notice to the Internal  Revenue Service under the provisions of section 508(a), and the trust  will therefore not be exempt from taxation under section 501(a). The  trust is a charitable trust within the meaning of section 4947(a)(1)  from the date of its creation.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. On March 1, 1971, Y creates a charitable remainder  annuity trust described in section 664(d)(1) under which Z, Y's son,  receives $10,000 per year for life, remainder to be held in trust for P,  an organization described in section 501(c)(3). Y is allowed a deduction  under section 170 for the present value of the remainder interest to P.  During Z's lifetime, the trust is a split-interest trust described in  section 4947(a)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section. Upon the death of  Z, all unexpected interests (consisting of P's remainder interest) will  be devoted to section 170(c)(2)(B) purposes. Except as provided in Sec.  53.4947-1(b)(2)(iv) (relating to a reasonable period of settlement) the  trust will be treated as a charitable trust within the meaning of  section 4947(a)(1) from the date of the death of Z unless the trustees  of the trust apply for recognition of section 501(c)(3) status under the  provisions of section 508(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scope of application of section 4947(a)(1)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Subject to paragraph (b)(2) (ii) through (vii) of this section, section  4947(a)(1) applies to nonexempt trusts in which all unexpired interests  are charitable. For purposes of this section, the term charitable when  used to describe an interest or beneficiary refers to the purposes  described in section 170(c)(2)(B). An estate from which the executor or  administrator is required to distribute all of the net assets in trust  to such beneficiaries will not be considered a charitable trust under  section 4947(a)(1) during the period of estate administration or  settlement, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.  A charitable trust created by will shall be considered a charitable  trust under section 4947(a)(1) as of the date of death of the decedent- grantor, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section  (relating to trusts which wind up. For the circumstances under which  segregated amounts are treated as charitable trusts, see Sec. 53.4947- 1(c)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estates. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When an estate from which the executor or  administrator is required to distribute all of the net assets in trust  for charitable beneficiaries, or free of trust to such beneficiaries, is  considered terminated for Federal income tax purposes under Sec.  1.641(b)-3(a), then the estate will be treated as a charitable trust  under section 4947(a)(1) between the date on which the estate is  considered terminated under Sec. 1.641(b)-3(a) and the date final  distribution of all of the net assets is made to or for the benefit of  the charitable beneficiaries. This (ii) does not affect the  determination of the tax   liability under Subtitle A of the beneficiaries of the estates.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The provisions of this (ii) may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. X bequeaths his entire estate, including 100 percent of the  stock of a wholly-owned corporation, to M, an organization described in  section 501(c)(3), under a will which gives his executor authority to  hold the stock and manage the corporation for a period of up to 10 years  for the benefit of M prior to its ultimate disposition. A deduction for  the charitable bequest was allowed to X's estate under section 2055. The  executor is vested with a full range of powers, including the power of  sale. Upon the death of X, his executor distributes X's assets to M  except for the stock of the corporation, which he holds for 5 years  prior to its disposition. The continued holding of the stock of the  corporation by the executor after the expiration of a reasonable time  for performance of all the ordinary duties of administration causes the  estate to be considered terminated for Federal income tax purposes  pursuant to Sec. 1.641(b)-3(a) and thereby subjects it to the  provisions of section 4947(a)(1) from the date of such termination to  the date of final disposition of the stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> does not affect the determination of the tax  liability under subtitle A of the beneficiaries of the trusts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Split-interest trusts which become charitable trusts. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A  split-interest trust (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) in  which all of the unexpired interests are charitable remainder interests  and in which some or all of the charitable beneficiaries are not  entitled to distributions of corpus within the meaning of paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section shall continue to be treated as a split- interest trust under section 4947(a)(2) rather than a charitable trust  under section 4947(a)(1) for a reasonable period of settlement after the  expiration of the noncharitable interest. Thus, a split-interest trust  which under its terms is to continue to hold assets for charitable  beneficiaries after the expiration of the noncharitable interest rather  than distributing them as in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section is  given a reasonable period of settlement before being treated as a  charitable trust. For purposes of this paragraph, the term reasonable  period of settlement means that period reasonably required (or if  shorter, actually required) by the trustee to perform the ordinary  duties of administration necessary for the settlement of the trust.  These duties include, for example, the collection of assets, the payment  of debts, taxes, and distributions, and the determination of the rights  of the subsequent beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> This (iv) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. On January 15, 1971, A creates a charitable remainder  annuity trust described in section 661(d)(1) under which the trustees  are required to distribute $10,000 a year to B, A's wife, for life,  remainder to be held in trust for the use of M, an organization  described in section 501(c)(3). A is allowed a deduction under section  170 for the amount of the charitable interest, and the trust is,  therefore, treated as a split-interest trust under section 4947(a)(2)  from the date of its creation. B dies on February 10, 1975. On April 15,  1975, the trustees complete performance of the ordinary duties of  administration necessary for the settlement of the trust brought about  by the death of B. These duties include, for example, an accounting for  and payment to the estate of B of amounts accrued by B while alive  during 1975. However, the trustees do not distribute the corpus to M by  April 15, 1975. The trust shall continue to be treated as a split- interest trust under section 4947(a)(2) until April 15, 1975. After  April 15, 1975, the trust shall be treated as a charitable trust under  section 4947(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Certain revocable and testamentary trusts which wind up. A  revocable trust that becomes irrevocable upon the death of the decedent- grantor, or a trust created by will, from which the trustee is required  to distribute all of the net assets in trust for or free of trust to  charitable beneficiaries is not considered a charitable trust under  section 4947(a)(1) for a reasonable period of settlement (within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section) after becoming  irrevocable. After that period the trust is considered a charitable  trust under section 4947(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Revocable trusts which become charitable trusts. A revocable  trust that becomes irrevocable upon the death of the decedent-grantor in  which all of the unexpired interests are charitable and under the terms  of the governing instrument of which the trustee is required to hold  some or all of the net assets in trust after becoming irrevocable solely  for charitable beneficiaries is not considered a trust under section  4947(a)(1) for a reasonable period of settlement (within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section) after becoming irrevocable except  that section 4941 may apply if the requirements of Sec. 53.4941(d)-1  (b)(3) are not met.

The application of paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this  section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. On January 30, 1970, H creates an inter vivos trust under  the terms of the governing instruments of which M, an organization  described in section 170(c)(3), and N, an organization described in  section 501(c)(3), are each to receive 50 percent of the income for a  period of 10 years. At the end of the 10 year period, the corpus is to  be distributed to O, an organization also described in section  501(c)(3). H is allowed a deduction under section 170 for the value of  all interests placed in trust. The payments to M do not constitute a  violation of section 4945(d)(5) or any other provision of Chapter 42 and  constitute qualifying distributions under section 4942.

A deduction under section 170(f)(2)(A) was  allowed with respect to the remainder interest of Y. Under section  4947(a)(2)(A), each annual amount which becomes payable to W during her  life is not subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section on or after  the date upon which it becomes so payable and the payment of each amount  to W is not an act of self-dealing under section 4941(d)(1) and does not  violate any other provision of chapter 42. However, except as provided  in the preceding sentence, the trust is subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)  of this section in the same manner as any other split-interest trust.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. H bequeaths the residue of his estate in trust for the  benefit of S, his son, and Y, an organization described in section  501(c)(3). A guaranteed annuity interest of $10,000 is to be paid to S  for 20 years. A guaranteed annuity interest of $5,000 which meets the  requirements contained in Sec. 20.2055-2(e)(2)(v)(a) is also to be paid  to Y for 20 years. Upon termination of the 20-year term, the corpus is  to be distributed to Z, another organization described in section  501(c)(3). The trust is a charitable remainder annuity trust as  described in section 664(d)(1) and the regulations thereunder, and a  deduction under section 2055(e)(2)(A) was allowed with respect to the  remainder interest of Z. A deduction was also allowed under section  2055(e)(2)(B) with respect to the guaranteed annuity interest of Y. The  assets in the trust are not segregated under section 4947(a)(2)(B) and  paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Under section 4947(a)(2)(A), each  payment of $10,000 to S is not subject to section 4947(a)(2) and  paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The payment of each amount to S is  not an act of self-dealing under section 4941(d)(1) and does not violate  any other provision of chapter 42.

The application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. H creates a trust under which the trustees are required  to pay over annually 5 percent of the net fair market value of M  building, valued annually, to W, H's wife, for life, remainder to S, H's  son. The other asset in the trust is N building, with respect to which  the trustees are required to pay over annually 5 percent of the net fair  market value of the building, valued annually, to X, a section 501(c)(3)  organization, for a period of 15 years, remainder to S. Each asset is  separately accounted for under section 4947(a)(3) and paragraph (c)(4)  of this section. He received a deduction under section 2522 for the  value of X's income interest in N building. Under these circumstances, M  building is considered segregated (within the meaning of section  4947(a)(2)(B)) from N building and is not subject to section 4947  (a)(2). The remainder interest of S in N building is not considered  segregated from the income interest of X in N building, since both are  interests in the same asset. N building is considered held in a split- interest trust which is subject to section 4947 (a)(2) and paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. H transfers $50,000 in trust to pay $2,500 per year to Z,  a section 501(c)(3) organization, for a term of 20 years, remainder to  S. H's son. H is allowed a deduction under section 2522 for the present  value of Z's income interest. The income interest of Z in the trust  asset cannot be segregated (within the meaning of section 4947(a)(2)(B))  from the remainder interest of S since both are interests in the same  asset.

A method of separate accounting will be considered ``regularly  employed'' by a trust when the method has been consistently followed in  prior taxable years or when a trust which has never before maintained  segregated amounts initiates a reasonable method of separate accounting  for its segregated amounts and consistently follows such method  thereafter. The trust shall keep permanent records and other data  relating to the segregated amounts as are necessary to enable the  district director to determine the correctness of the application of the  rules prescribed in paragraph (c) (3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Amounts transferred in trust before May 27, 1969--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General  rule.

Amounts transferred in trust before May 27,  1969, also include amounts transferred to a testamentary trust created  by the will of a decedent who died after May 26, 1969 if the will was  executed before May 27, 1969 and no dispositive provision of the   will was amended (within the meaning of Sec. 20.2055-2(e)(4) and (5))  by the decedent by codicil or otherwise, after May 26, 1969, and the  decedent was on May 27, 1969, and at all times thereafter under a mental  disability (as defined in Sec. 1.642(c)-2(b)(3)(ii)) to amend the will  by codicil or otherwise.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The provisions of this (iii) may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. X executed a will in 1960 which provided for the creation  of a testamentary trust which meets the description of a split-interest  trust under section 4947(a)(2). X died on April 15, 1969. Under the  provisions of his will, the probate court permitted certain property in  X's estate to be transferred to the testamentary trust at fixed  intervals over a period of two years during the administration of the  estate. Section 4947(a)(2) does not apply to any amount described in  this example, including the amounts transferred after May 26, 1969,  because, for purposes of section 4947(a)(2)(C), each such transfer will  be treated as an amount transferred in trust before May 27, 1969, within  the meaning of section 4947(a)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Scope of application of section 4947(a)(2)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Subject to paragraph (c)(6) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section,  section 4947(a)(2) applies to trusts in which some but not all unexpired  interests are charitable. An estate from which the executor or  administrator is required to distribute all of the net assets in trust  or free of trust to both charitable and noncharitable beneficiaries will  not be considered to be a split-interest trust under section 4947(a)(2)  during the period of estate administration or settlement, except as  provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. A split-interest trust  created by will shall be considered a split-interest trust under section  4947(a)(2) as of the date of death of the decedent-grantor, except as  provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estates. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When an estate from which the executor or  administrator is required to distribute all of the net assets in trust  or free of trust to both charitable and noncharitable beneficiaries is  considered terminated for Federal income tax purposes under Sec.  1.641(b)-3(a), then the estate will be treated as a split-interest trust  under section 4947(a)(2) (or a charitable trust under section  4957(a)(1), if applicable) between the date on which the estate is  considered terminated under Sec. 1.641(b)-3(a) and the date on which  final distribution of the net assets to the last remaining charitable  beneficiary is made. This (ii) does not affect the determination of the  tax liability under subtitle A of either charitable or noncharitable  beneficiaries of the estates.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The provisions of this (ii) may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. X dies on January 15, 1973 and bequeaths $10,000 to M, an  organization described in section 501(c)(3), and the residue of his  estate to W, his wife. A deduction for the charitable bequest was  allowed to X's estate under section 2055. Substantially all of X's  estate consists of 100 percent of the stock of a wholly owned  corporation, certain liquid assets such as marketable stocks and  securities and bank accounts, and X's home, automobile, and other  personal property. X's will gives his executor a full range of powers,  including the power to sell the stock of the wholly owned corporation.  After the death of X, his executor continues to manage the wholly owned  corporation while attempting to sell the stock of the corporation.  During this period, the executor makes no distributions to M. On May 24,  1978, the Internal Revenue Service determines under Sec. 1.641(b)-3(a)  that the administration of the estate has been unduly prolonged and the  estate is considered terminated as of that date for Federal income tax  purposes. X's estate will be treated as a split-interest trust described  in section 4947(a)(2) between May 24, 1978 and the date on which the  $10,000 bequest to M is satisfied. X's estate will therefore be subject  to the applicable private foundation provisions during that period and,  for example, a sale of the house by the estate to any disqualified  person (as defined in section 4946) will be an act of self-dealing under  section 4941.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>, the   term reasonable period of settlement means that period reasonably  required (or if shorter, actually required) by the trustee to perform  the ordinary duties of administration necessary for the settlement of  the trust. These duties include, for example, the collection of assets,  the payment of debts, taxes, and distributions, and the determination of  rights of the subsequent beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Certain revocable and testamentary trusts which wind up. A  revocable trust that becomes irrevocable upon the death of the decedent- grantor, or a trust created by will, from which the trustee is required  to distribute all of the net assets in trust or free of trust to both  charitable and noncharitable beneficiaries is not considered a split- interest trust under section 4947(a)(2) for a reasonable period of  settlement (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section)  after becoming irrevocable. After that period, the trust is considered a  split-interest trust under section 4947(a)(2) (or a charitable trust  under section 4947(a)(1), if applicable).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> and Sec. 1.508-2(b). Since a  charitable remainder trust (as defined in section 664) is not exempt  under section 501(a), it is subject to section 4947(a)(2), and thus to  the governing instrument requirements of section 508(e) to the extent  they are applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application of section 507(a)--(1) General rule. The provisions  of section 507(a) shall not apply to a trust described in section  4947(a) </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (2) by reason of any payment to a beneficiary that is  directed by the terms of the governing instrument of the trust and is  not discretionary with the trustee or, in the case of a discretionary  payment, by reason of, or following, the expiration of the last  remaining charitable interest in the trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this (e) may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. H creates a section 4947(a)(1) trust under which the  income is to be paid for 15 years to R, a section 501(c)(3)  organization. Upon the expiration of 15 years, the trust is to terminate  and distribute all of its assets to S, another section 501(c)(3)  organization. Distribution of the corpus of the trust to S will not be  considered a termination of the trust's private foundation status within  the meaning of section 507(a).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. H creates a trust under which X, a section 501(c)(3)  organization, receives $20,000 per year for a period of 20 years,  remainder to S, H's son. H is allowed a deduction under section 2522 for  the present value of X's interest.</p><p class="depth3">When the final payment to X has been made at the end of the 20-year  period in accordance with the terms of the trust, the provisions of  section 4947(a)(2) will cease to apply to the trust because the trust no  longer retains any amounts for which the deduction under section 2522  was allowed. However, the final payment to X will not be considered a  termination of the trust's private foundation status within the meaning  of section 507(a).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. J creates a charitable remainder annuity trust described  in section 664(d)(1) under which S, J's son, receives $10,000 per year  for life, remainder to be distributed outright to P, an organization  described in section 501(c)(3). J is allowed a deduction under section  170 for the value of the remainder interest placed in trust for the  benefit of P, and the provisions of section 4947(a)(2) apply to the  trust. At the death of S, the trust will terminate and all assets will  be distributed to P. However, such final distribution to P will not be  considered a termination of the trust's private foundation status within  the meaning of section 507(a).
