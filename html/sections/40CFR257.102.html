The closure plan must  also discuss how the final cover system will achieve the performance  standards specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An estimate of the maximum inventory of CCR ever on-site over  the active life of the CCR unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An estimate of the largest area of the CCR unit ever requiring a  final cover as required by paragraph (d) of this section at any time  during the CCR unit's active life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A schedule for completing all activities necessary to satisfy  the closure criteria in this section, including an estimate of the year  in which all closure   activities for the CCR unit will be completed. The schedule should  provide sufficient information to describe the sequential steps that  will be taken to close the CCR unit, including identification of major  milestones such as coordinating with and obtaining necessary approvals  and permits from other agencies, the dewatering and stabilization phases  of CCR surface impoundment closure, or installation of the final cover  system, and the estimated timeframes to complete each step or phase of  CCR unit closure. When preparing the written closure plan, if the owner  or operator of a CCR unit estimates that the time required to complete  closure will exceed the timeframes specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this  section, the written closure plan must include the site-specific  information, factors and considerations that would support any time  extension sought under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timeframes for preparing the initial written closure plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Existing CCR landfills and existing CCR surface impoundments.

The owner  or operator may obtain two-year extensions provided the owner or  operator continues to be able to demonstrate that there is reasonable  likelihood that the CCR unit will accept wastes in the foreseeable  future or will remove CCR from the unit for the purpose of beneficial  use. The owner or operator must place each completed demonstration, if  more than one time extension is sought, in the facility's operating  record as required by Sec. 257.105(i)(5) prior to the end of any two- year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Information documenting that the CCR unit has remaining storage  or disposal capacity or that the CCR unit can have CCR removed for the  purpose of beneficial use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> through (4) of this  section are examples of situations that would support a determination  that the CCR unit will resume receiving CCR or non-CCR waste streams in  the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal plant operations include periods during which the CCR  unit does not receive CCR or non-CCR waste streams, such as the  alternating use of two or more CCR units whereby at any point in time  one CCR unit is receiving CCR while CCR is being removed from a second  CCR unit after its dewatering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The CCR unit is dedicated to a coal-fired boiler unit that is  temporarily idled (e.g., CCR is not being generated) and there is a  reasonable likelihood that the coal-fired boiler will resume operations  in the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The CCR unit is dedicated to an operating coal-fired boiler  (i.e., CCR is being generated); however, no CCR are being placed in the  CCR unit because the CCR are being entirely diverted to beneficial uses,  but there is a reasonable likelihood that the CCR unit will again be  used in the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The CCR unit currently receives only non-CCR waste streams and  those non-CCR waste streams are not generated for an extended period of  time, but there is a reasonable likelihood that the CCR unit will again  receive non-CCR waste streams in the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In order to obtain additional time extension(s) to initiate  closure of a CCR unit beyond the two years provided by paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must  include with the demonstration required by paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this  section the following statement signed by the owner or operator or an  authorized representative:</p><p class="depth0">I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and  am familiar with the information submitted in this demonstration and all  attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals  immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that  the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete.
