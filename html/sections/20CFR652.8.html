The Secretary reserves the  right to exercise prior approval authority in other areas, after  providing advance notice to the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application for financial assistance and modification  requirements shall be as specified under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost of promotional and informational activities consistent with  the provisions of the Act, describing services offered by employment  security agencies, job openings, labor market information, and similar  items are allowable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each State shall retain basic documents for the minimum period  specified below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Work Application: One year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Job Order: One Year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Costs of employer contributions and expenses incurred for State  agency fringe benefit plans that do not meet the requirements in OMB  Circular A-87 (Revised) are allowable, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For retirement plans, on behalf of individuals employed before  the effective date of this part, the plan is authorized by State law and  previously approved by the Secretary; the plan is insured by a private  insurance carrier which is licensed to operate this type of plan; and  any dividends or similar credits due to participation in the plan are  credited against the next premium falling due under the contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For retirement plans on behalf of individuals employed after  the effective date of this part, and for fringe benefit plans other than  retirement, the Secretary grants a time extension to cover an interim  period if State legislative action is required for such employees to be  covered by plans which meet the requirements of OMB Circular A-87  (Revised). During this interim period, State agency employees may be  enrolled in plans open to State agency employees only. No such extension  may continue beyond the 60th day following the completion of the next  full session of the State legislature which begins after the effective  date of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For fringe benefit plans other than retirement, the Secretary  grants a time extension which may continue until such time as they are  comparable in cost to those fringe benefit plans available to other  similarly employed employees of the State on the condition that there  are no benefit improvements. The Secretary may grant this time extension  if the State agency can demonstrate that the extension is necessary to  prevent loss of benefits to current States agency employees, retirees  and/or their fringe benefit plan beneficiaries, or that it is necessary  to avoid unreasonable expenditures on behalf of the employee or employer  to maintain such fringe benefits for current employees and retirees. At  such time as the cost of these fringe benefit plans becomes equitable  with those available to other similarly employed State employees, the  time extension will cease and the requirements of OMB Circular A-87  (Revised) will apply;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requests for time extensions under this section will include an  opinion of the State Attorney General, that either legislative action is  required to accomplish compliance with OMB Circular A-87 (Revised) or,  for (d)(6)(iii) of this section that such compliance would result in  either loss of current benefits to State agency employees and retirees  or unreasonable expenditures to maintain these benefits. Such requests  will be filed with the Secretary no later than 30 days after the  effective date of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Time extensions granted relative to (d)(6)(iii) of this section  require a signed statement by the State agency Administrator, that no  improvements have been made to fringe benefits under the extension and  that the   plan(s) is (are) not consistent with those available to other similarly  employed State employees, for each year of the extension.

The  informal resolution period shall be at least 60 days from issuance of  the initial determination and no more that 170 days from the receipt by  the Secretary of the final approved audit report. If the matters are  resolved informally, the Secretary shall issue a final determination  pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section which notifies the  parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the  file.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the matter is not resolved informally, the Secretary shall  provide each party with a final written determination by certified mail,  return receipt requested. In the case of audits, the final determination  shall be issued not later than 180 days after the receipt by the  Secretary of the final approved audit report. The final determination  shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Indicate that efforts to resolve informally matters contained in  the initial determination have been unsuccessful;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions  set forth in the initial determination;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Establish a debt if appropriate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Determine liability, method of restitution of funds and  sanctions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with 20 CFR  658.707   through 658.711 in the case of a final determination imposing a sanction  or corrective action; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Constitute final agency action unless a hearing is requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Sanctions for violation of the Act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary may impose  appropriate sanctions and corrective actions for violation of the Act,  regulations, or State plan, including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requiring repayment, for debts owed the Government under the  grant, from non-Federal funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Offsetting debts arising from the misexpenditure of grant  funds, against amounts to which the State is or may be entitled under  the Act, provided that debts arising from gross negligence or willful  misuse of funds shall not be offset against future grants. When the  Secretary reduces amounts allotted to the State by the amount of the  misexpenditure, the debt shall be fully satisfied;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determining the amount of Federal cash maintained by the State  or a subrecipient in excess of reasonable grant needs, establishing a  debt for the amount of such excessive cash, and charging interest on  that debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Imposing other appropriate sanctions or corrective actions,  except where specifically prohibited by the Act or regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To impose a sanction or corrective action, the Secretary shall  utilize the initial and final determination procedures outlined in  (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Other violations.
