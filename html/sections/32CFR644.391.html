                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where a substantial Army installation, or portion thereof, is involved, the DE will convene a predisposal conference with representatives of the using command, GSA, and other interested parties. Where an Air Force installation is involved, the Major Air Command will take the initiative in convening the conference. In any cases involving flying facilities, Federal Aviation Administration representatives will be invited. The agenda of the predisposal conference should provide for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determinations on maintenance guidelines based on probable future uses of the property with emphasis on agreements concerning responsibility for assumption of care and custody, in accordance with AR 405-90, AFR 87-4, and Sec. Sec. 644.368 through 644.375.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review of the SF 118 to assure its acceptability to GSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review with GSA, when appropriate, of the advisability of transferring custody and maintenance responsibilities to GSA at an early date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Planning for and, to the extent possible, making definite determinations on interim utilization pending disposal by GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is of utmost importance that excess installations be put to productive use as military operations are phased out. This will do much to lessen the impact of the installation's closing on the economy of the local community. For this purpose, installations, in many cases, will be reported to GSA prior to phase out of military operations. In these cases, the DE has responsibility to insure, to the extent practicable, that other productive use is phased in as military operations are phased out. This can be accomplished only by careful planning and continuous coordination by the DE with using command and GSA. The using command will plan and execute the military phase out. However, the DE will assure that the Report of Excess to GSA specifically identifies and excludes the real and personal property to be retained by the military department. This information is required by GSA for disposal purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A report on the predisposal conference will be forwarded to DAEN-REM. Any difficulties indicated by GSA will be summarized in the report, along with any other problems encountered or foreseen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When requested, and on an individual project basis, the DE will prepare a real estate disposal study concerning the transfer of custody and maintenance responsibilities to GSA prior to final disposal. This study will be developed in conjunction with appropriate using command and GSA representatives. Its purpose will be to determine whether the transfer of the excess property to GSA would be more economical and in the best interest of the Government. Important benefits to DOD agencies would be reduction in expenditures and personnel of the military departments for such functions. Copies of the study will be furnished the using command concerned for timely review and recommendations.</p>
