                            <p class="depth0">The congressional policy under which employees ``engaged in commerce  or in the production of goods for commerce'' are brought within the  general coverage of the Act's wage and hours provisions is stated in  section 2 of the Act. This section makes it clear that the congressional  power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is exercised in this  Act in order to remedy certain evils, namely, ``labor conditions  detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living  necessary for health, efficiency, and the general well being of  workers'' which Congress found ``(a) causes commerce and the channels  and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to perpetuate such labor  conditions among the workers of the several States; (b) burdens commerce  and the free flow of goods in commerce; (c) constitutes an unfair method  of competition in commerce; (d) leads to labor disputes burdening and  obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce and (e)  interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce.''  In carrying out these broad remedial purposes, however, the Congress did  not choose to make the scope of the Act coextensive in all respects with  the limits of its power over commerce or to apply it to all activities  affecting commerce. \7\ Congress delimited the area in which the Act  operates by providing for certain exceptions and exemptions, and by  making wage-hour coverage applicable only to employees who are ``engaged  in'' either ``commerce'', as defined in the Act, or ``production'' of  ``goods'' for such commerce, within the meaning of the Act's definitions  of these terms. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949 indicate an  intention to restrict somewhat the category of employees within the  reach of the Act under the former definition of ``produced'' and to  expand to some extent the group covered under the former definition of  ``commerce.'' In his interpretations, the Administrator will endeavor to  give effect to both the broad remedial purposes of the Act and the  limitations on its application, seeking guidance in his task from the  terms of the statute, from authoritative court decisions, and from the  legislative history of the Act, as amended. \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ Kirschbaum v.
