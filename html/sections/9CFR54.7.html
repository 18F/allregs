                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scrapie-positive and suspect animals for which indemnification is sought must be destroyed on the premises where they are held, pastured, or penned at the time indemnity is approved or moved to an approved research facility, unless the APHIS representative involved approves in advance of destruction moving the animals to another location for destruction. Animals that are not scrapie-positive or suspect animals for which indemnification is sought may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Slaughtered when moved in accordance with part 79 of this chapter and with the prior written approval of the APHIS representative involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Destroyed on the premises where they are held, pastured, or penned at the time indemnity is approved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Moved to an approved research facility; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Moved to another location for destruction if an APHIS representative approves the movement in advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The carcasses of animals destroyed in accordance with this section are authorized by the Administrator to be buried, incinerated, or disposed of by other methods in accordance with local, State, and Federal laws. The carcasses of scrapie-positive and suspect animals may not be processed for human or animal food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The destruction of animals and disposition of their carcasses in accordance with this part must be monitored by an APHIS representative who will prepare and transmit to the Administrator a report identifying the animals and showing their disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> APHIS may pay the reasonable costs of disposal for scrapie-positive and suspect animals that are indemnified. To obtain reimbursement for disposal costs, animal owners must obtain written approval of the disposal costs from APHIS, prior to disposal. The Administrator may also authorize payment of up to half the reasonable disposal costs for animals that are eligible to be destroyed by slaughter under this section but for which slaughter is not a practical or cost efficient means of disposal; Provided that, APHIS may pay more than one-half of the expenses when the Administrator determines that doing so will contribute to scrapie eradication. For reimbursement to be made, the owner of the animals must present the area veterinarian in charge with a copy of either a receipt for expenses paid or a bill for services rendered. Any bill for services rendered by the owner must not be greater than the normal fee for similar services provided by a commercial hauler or disposal facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipment. When required, cleaning and disinfection shall be conducted under the supervision of a State or APHIS representative as follows. Additional guidance on acceptable means of cleaning and disinfection is also available in the Scrapie Flock Certification Program standards and the Scrapie Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drylot areas. When required, remove the manure and top 1-2 inches of soil to reduce contamination. Bury, till under, or compost the removed material in areas not accessed by domestic animals or wildlife.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cement, wood, metal, and other non-earth surfaces, tools, equipment, instruments, feed, hay, bedding, and other materials. Remove all organic material and compost or incinerate. Clean and wash all surfaces, tools, equipment, and instruments using hot water and detergent. Allow all surfaces, tools,

equipment, and instruments to dry completely before disinfecting and sanitizing using the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incinerate items by high-temperature incineration methods;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Autoclave instruments, small tools, and other items at 136 [deg]C for 1 hour;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To clean dry surfaces, apply a 2-percent chlorine bleach solution at room temperature (at least 18.3 [deg]C for 1 hour, or apply a 1-molar solution of sodium hydroxide (approximately 5 oz. of sodium hydroxide dissolved in l gallon water) at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
