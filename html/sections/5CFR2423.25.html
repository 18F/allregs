                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Informal and formal settlements. Post complaint settlements may  be either informal or formal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Informal settlement agreements provide for withdrawal of the  complaint by the Regional Director and are not subject to approval by or  an order of the Authority. If the Respondent fails to perform its  obligations under the informal settlement agreement, the Regional  Director may reinstitute formal proceedings consistent with this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Formal settlement agreements are subject to approval by the  Authority, and include the parties' agreement to waive their right to a  hearing and acknowledgment that the Authority may issue an order  requiring the Respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the  settlement. The formal settlement agreement shall also contain the  Respondent's consent to the Authority's application for the entry of a  decree by an appropriate federal court enforcing the Authority's order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Informal settlement procedure. If the Charging Party and the  Respondent enter into an informal settlement agreement that is accepted  by the Regional Director, the Regional Director shall withdraw the  complaint and approve the informal settlement agreement. If the Charging  Party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement  agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes  that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal  Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director shall  enter into the agreement with the Respondent and shall withdraw the  complaint. The Charging Party then may obtain a review of the Regional  Director's action by filing an appeal with the General Counsel as  provided in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formal settlement procedure. If the Charging Party and the  Respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement that is accepted by  the Regional Director, the Regional Director shall withdraw the  complaint upon approval of the formal settlement agreement by the  Authority. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to a  formal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional  Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the  policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the  agreement shall be between the Respondent and the Regional Director. The  formal settlement agreement together with the Charging Party's  objections, if any, shall be submitted to the Authority for approval.  The Authority may approve a formal settlement agreement upon a  sufficient showing that it will effectuate the policies of the Federal  Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Settlement judge program. The Administrative Law Judge, in the  Judge's discretion or upon the request of any party, may assign a judge  or other appropriate official, who shall be other   than the hearing judge unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the  parties, to conduct negotiations for settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The settlement official shall convene and preside over  settlement conferences by telephone or in person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The settlement official may require that the representative for  each party be present at settlement conferences and that the parties or  agents with full settlement authority be present or available by  telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The settlement official shall not discuss any aspect of the case  with the hearing judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement,  and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement  official shall be admissible in any proceeding before the Administrative  Law Judge or Authority, except by stipulation of the parties.</p>
