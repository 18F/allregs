Appendix A to Part 50--Life Insurance Products and Securities</p><p class="depth0">A. Life Insurance Product Content Prerequisites</p><p class="depth0">Companies must provide DoD personnel a written description for each  product or service they intend to market to DoD personnel on DoD  installations. These descriptions must be written in a manner that DoD  personnel can easily understand, and fully disclose the fundamental  nature of the policy. Companies must be able to demonstrate that each  form to be used has been filed with and approved, where applicable, by  the insurance department of the State where the installation is located.  Insurance products marketed to DoD personnel on overseas installations  must conform to the standards prescribed by the laws of the State where  the company is incorporated.</p><p class="depth0">1. Insurance products, other than certificates or other evidence of  insurance issued by a self-insured association, offered and sold  worldwide to personnel on DoD installations, must:</p><p class="depth0">a. Comply with the insurance laws of the State or country in which  the installation is located and the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">b. Contain no restrictions by reason of Military Service or military  occupational specialty of the insured, unless such restrictions are  clearly indicated on the face of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">c. Plainly indicate any extra premium charges imposed by reason of  Military Service or military occupational specialty.</p><p class="depth0">d. Contain no variation in the amount of death benefit or premium  based upon the length of time the contract has been in force, unless all  such variations are clearly described in the contract.</p><p class="depth0">e. In plain and readily understandable language, and in type font at  least as large as the font used for the majority of the policy, inform  Service members of:</p><p class="depth0">1. The availability and cost of government subsidized Servicemen's  Group Life Insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. The address and phone number where consumer complaints are  received by the State insurance commissioner for the State in which the  insurance product is being sold.</p><p class="depth0">3. That the U.S. Government has in no way sanctioned, recommended,  or encouraged the sale of the product being offered. With respect to the  sale or solicitation of insurance on Federal land or facilitates located  outside the United States, insurance products must contain the address  and phone number where   consumer complaints are received by the State insurance commissioner for  the State which has issued the agent a resident license or the company  is domiciled, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. To comply with paragraphs A.1.b., A.1.c. and A.1.d., an  appropriate reference stamped on the first page of the contract shall  draw the attention of the policyholder to any restrictions by reason of  Military Service or military occupational specialty. The reference shall  describe any extra premium charges and any variations in the amount of  death benefit or premium based upon the length of time the contract has  been in force.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable life insurance products may be offered provided they  meet the criteria of the appropriate insurance regulatory agency and the  Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Insurance products shall not be marketed or sold disguised as  investments. If there is a savings component to an insurance product,  the agent shall provide the customer written documentation, which  clearly explains how much of the premium goes to the savings component  per year broken down over the life of the policy. This document must  also show the total amount per year allocated to insurance premiums. The  customer must be provided a copy of this document that is signed by the  insurance agent.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sale of Securities</p><p class="depth0">1. All securities must be registered with the Securities and  Exchange Commission.</p><p class="depth0">2. All sales of securities must comply with the appropriate  Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. All securities representatives must apply to the commander of the  installation on which they desire to solicit the sale of securities for  permission to solicit.</p><p class="depth0">4. Where the accredited insurer's policy permits, an overseas  accredited life insurance agent--if duly qualified to engage in security  activities either as a registered representative of the National  Association of Securities Dealers or as an associate of a broker or  dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission--may offer  life insurance and securities for sale simultaneously. In cases of  commingled sales, the allotment of pay for the purchase of securities  cannot be made to the insurer.</p><p class="depth0">C. Use of the Allotment of Pay System</p><p class="depth0">1. Allotments of military pay for life insurance products shall be  made in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R.</p><p class="depth0">2. For personnel in pay grades E-4 and below, in order to obtain  financial counseling, at least seven calendar days shall elapse between  the signing of a life insurance application and the certification of a  military pay allotment for any supplemental commercial life insurance.  Installation Finance Officers are responsible for ensuring this seven- day cooling-off period is monitored and enforced. The purchaser's  commanding officer may grant a waiver of the seven-day cooling-off  period requirement for good cause, such as the purchaser's imminent  deployment or permanent change of station.</p><p class="depth0">D. Associations--General</p><p class="depth0">The recent growth and general acceptability of quasi-military  associations offering various insurance plans to military personnel are  acknowledged. Some associations are not organized within the supervision  of insurance laws of either a State or the Federal Government. While  some are organized for profit, others function as nonprofit associations  under Internal Revenue Service regulations. Regardless of the manner in  which insurance is offered to members, the management of the association  is responsible for complying fully with the policies contained in this  part.    Sec. Appendix B to Part 50--Overseas Life Insurance Registration Program</p><p class="depth0">A. Registration Criteria</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial Registration</p><p class="depth0">a. Insurers must demonstrate continuous successful operation in the  life insurance business for a period of not less than 5 years on  December 31 of the year preceding the date of filing the application.</p><p class="depth0">b. Insurers must be listed in Best's Life-Health Insurance Reports  and be assigned a rating of B+ (Very Good) or better for the business  year preceding the Government's fiscal year for which registration is  sought.</p><p class="depth0">2. Re-Registration</p><p class="depth0">a. Insurers must demonstrate continuous successful operation in the  life insurance business, as described in paragraph A.1.a. of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. Insurers must retain a Best's rating of B+ or better, as  described in paragraph A.1.b. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">c. Insurers must demonstrate a record of compliance with the  policies found in this part.</p><p class="depth0">3. Waiver Provisions</p><p class="depth0">Waivers of the initial registration or re-registration provisions  shall be considered for those insurers demonstrating substantial  compliance with the aforementioned criteria.</p><p class="depth0">B. Application Instructions</p><p class="depth0">1. Applications Filed Annually. Insurers must apply by June 30 of  each year for solicitation privileges on overseas U.S. military   installations for the next fiscal year beginning October 1. Applications  e-mailed, faxed, or postmarked after June 30 shall not be considered.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application prerequisites. A letter of application, signed by the  President, Vice President, or designated official of the insurance  company shall be forwarded to the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness), Attention: Morale, Welfare and  Recreation (MWR) Policy Directorate, 4000 Defense, Pentagon, Washington,  DC 20301-4000. The registration criteria in paragraph A1.a. or A1.b. of  this appendix must be met to satisfy application prerequisites. The  letter shall contain the information set forth below, submitted in the  order listed. Where criteria are not applicable, the letter shall so  state.</p><p class="depth0">a. The overseas Combatant Commands (e.g., U.S. European Command,  U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command) where  the company presently solicits, or plans to solicit, on U.S. military  installations.</p><p class="depth0">b. A statement that the company has complied with, or shall comply  with, the applicable laws of the country or countries wherein it  proposes to solicit. ``Laws of the country'' means all national,  provincial, city, or county laws or ordinances of any country, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0">c. A statement that the products to be offered for sale conform to  the standards prescribed in appendix A to this part and contain only the  standard provisions such as those prescribed by the laws of the State  where the company's headquarters are located.</p><p class="depth0">d. A statement that the company shall assume full responsibility for  the acts of its agents with respect to solicitation. If warranted, the  number of agents may be limited by the overseas command concerned.</p><p class="depth0">e. A statement that the company shall only use agents who have been  licensed by the appropriate State and registered by the overseas command  concerned to sell to DoD personnel on DoD installations.</p><p class="depth0">f. Any explanatory or supplemental comments that shall assist in  evaluating the application.</p><p class="depth0">g. If the Department of Defense requires facts or statistics beyond  those normally involved in registration, the company shall make separate  arrangements to provide them.</p><p class="depth0">h. A statement that the company's general agent and other registered  agents are appointed in accordance with the prerequisites established in  section C of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3. If a company is a life insurance company subsidiary, it must be  registered separately on its own merits.</p><p class="depth0">C. Agent Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The overseas Combatant Commanders shall apply the following  principles in registering agents:</p><p class="depth0">1. An agent must possess a current State license. This requirement  may be waived for a registered agent continuously residing and  successfully selling life insurance in foreign areas, who, through no  fault of his or her own, due to State law (or regulation) governing  domicile requirements, or requiring that the agent's company be licensed  to do business in that State, forfeits eligibility for a State license.  The request for a waiver shall contain the name of the State or  jurisdiction that would not renew the agent's license.</p><p class="depth0">2. General agents and agents may represent only one registered  commercial insurance company. This principle may be waived by the  overseas Combatant Commander if multiple representations are in the best  interest of DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth0">3. An agent must have at least 1 year of successful life insurance  underwriting experience in the United States or its territories,  generally within the 5 years preceding the date of application, in order  to be approved for overseas solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">4. The overseas Combatant Commanders may exercise further agent  control procedures as necessary.</p><p class="depth0">5. An agent, once registered in an overseas area, may not change  affiliation from the staff of one general agent to another and retain  registration, unless the previous employer certifies in writing that the  release is without justifiable prejudice. Overseas Combatant Commanders  will have final authority to determine justifiable prejudice.  Indebtedness of an agent to a previous employer is an example of  justifiable prejudice.</p><p class="depth0">D. Announcement of Registration</p><p class="depth0">1. Registration by the Department of Defense upon annual  applications of insurers shall be announced as soon as practicable by  notice to each applicant and by a list released annually in September to  the appropriate overseas Combatant Commanders. Approval does not  constitute DoD endorsement of the insurer or its products. Any  advertising by insurers or verbal representation by its agents, which  suggests such endorsement, is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">2. In the event registration is denied, specific reasons for the  denial shall be provided to the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">a. The insurer shall have 30 days from the receipt of notification  of denial of registration (sent certified mail, return receipt  requested) in which to request reconsideration of the original decision.  This request must be in writing and accompanied by substantiating data  or information in rebuttal of the   specific reasons upon which the denial was based.</p><p class="depth0">b. Action by the Office of the PDUSD(P&R;) on a request for  reconsideration is final.</p><p class="depth0">c. An applicant that is presently registered as an insurer shall  have 90 calendar days from final action denying registration in which to  close operations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Upon receiving an annual letter approving registration, each  company shall send to the applicable overseas Combatant Commander a  verified list of agents currently registered for overseas solicitation.  Where applicable, the company shall also include the names and prior  military affiliation of new agents for whom original registration and  permission to solicit on base is requested. Insurers initially  registered shall be furnished instructions by the Department of Defense  for agent registration procedures in overseas areas.</p><p class="depth0">4. Material changes affecting the corporate status and financial  condition of the company that occur during the fiscal year of  registration must be reported to the MWR Policy Directorate at the  address in paragraph B.2. of this appendix as they occur.</p><p class="depth0">a. The Office of the PDUSD(P&R;) reserves the right to terminate  registration if such material changes appear to substantially affect the  financial and operational standards described in section A of this  appendix on which registration was based.</p><p class="depth0">b. Failure to report such material changes may result in termination  of registration regardless of how it affects the standards.</p><p class="depth0">5. If an analysis of information furnished by the company indicates  that unfavorable trends are developing that could adversely affect its  future operations, the Office of the PDUSD(P&R;) may, at its option,  bring such matters to the attention of the company and request a  statement as to what action, if any, is considered to deal with such  unfavorable trends.</p>
