                            <p class="depth0">The following criteria will control eligibility for reinsuring and converting companies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The company must be a legal reserve life insurance company as classified by the insurance supervisory authorities of the State of domicile. Qualified fraternal organizations are included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The company must have been in the life insurance business for a continuous period of 5 years prior to October 1, 1965, or the December 31 preceding any redeterminations of the allocations. In the event of a merger, the 5-year requirement may be satisfied by either the surviving company or by one of the absorbed companies. Upon joint application by a subsidiary of a participating company, together with the parent company, the 5-year requirement may be waived provided such parent company owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the subsidiary and has been a legal reserve life insurance company for a period of 10 years or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The company must be licensed to engage in life insurance in at least one State of the United States or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The company will not be one: (1) Certified by the Department of Defense as being under suspension for cause for purpose of allotment or on-base solicitation privileges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That solicits life insurance applications as conversion or other replacement of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life Insurance coverage in jurisdictions in which it is not licensed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That fails to take effective action to correct an improper practice followed by it or its agents within 30 days after written receipt of notice issued by the insurer or the Assistant Director for Insurance. Improper practice includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The use for solicitation purposes of lists of names and addresses of former members without obtaining reasonable assurance that such lists have not been obtained contrary to regulations of the Department of Defense or other uniformed service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to reveal sources and copies of mailing lists upon proper request or to otherwise cooperate in an authorized investigation of a reported improper practice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The use of written or oral representations which may mislead the person addressed as to the true role of the company or its representatives as one of the participating companies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The use of written or oral representations which may mislead the person addressed as to rights, privileges, coverage, premiums, or similar matters under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' Group Life Insurance, or any policy issued or proposed to be issued as a conversion or other replacement coverage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Violation of regulations of a uniformed service concerning solicitation of life insurance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The use of written or oral references to Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' Group Life Insurance or conversions of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life Insurance in connection with the attempted sale of an insurance policy which would not be, in fact, a conversion policy or a policy issued in lieu of a conversion, if those references might lead a person addressed to believe there is a connection between the policy being sold and coverage under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' Group Life Insurance or a conversion of it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Each reinsuring and converting company must agree to issue conversion policies to any qualified applicant regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, under terms and

conditions established by the primary insurer.
