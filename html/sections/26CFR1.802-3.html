See section 802(a)(3) and  paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.802-5 for a transitional rule applicable in  certain cases in determining tax liability for the taxable years 1959  and 1960 by reason of the operation of section 802(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Tax imposed in case of certain capital gains--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1, 1962. For  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1,  1962, if the net long-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(7))  of any life insurance company exceeds its net short-term capital loss  (as defined in section 1222(6)), section 802(a)(2) imposes a separate  tax equal to 25 percent of such excess. This separate 25 percent tax  rate applies whether or not there is life insurance company taxable  income, taxable investment income, or a gain or loss from operations for  the taxable year. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958,  and before January 1, 1962, only the excess (if any) of net short-term  capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) over net long-term capital  loss (as defined in section 1222(8)) shall be taken into account in  computing taxable investment income and gain or loss from operations.  See sections 804(b) and 809(b). Except as modified by section 817 (rules  relating to certain gains and losses), the general rules of the Code  relating to gains and losses (such as the rules for determining the  amount, characterization, and treatment thereof) shall apply with  respect to life insurance companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  imposes an alternative tax in lieu of the tax imposed by section  802(a)(1), if and only if such alternative tax is less than the tax  imposed by section 802(a)(1). The alternative tax is the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A partial tax, computed as provided by section 802(a)(1), on the  life insurance company taxable income determined by reducing the taxable  investment income, and the gain from operations, by the amount of the  excess of its net long-term capital gain over its net short-term capital  loss, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> In the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1,  1970, an amount equal to 25 percent of such excess, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969,  an amount determined as provided in section 1201(a) and paragraph (a)(3)  of Sec. 1.1201-1 on such excess.   In the computation of the partial tax, the deductions provided by  sections 170 (as modified by section 809(a)(3)), 243, 244, 245 (as  modified by sections 804 (a)(5) and 809(d)(8)(B)), and the limitation  provided by section 809(f), shall not be recomputed as a result of the  reduction of taxable investment income, and gain from operations, by the  amount of such excess. Except as modified by section 817 (rules relating  to certain gains and losses), the general rules of the Code relating to  gains and losses (such as the rules for determining the amount,  characterization and treatment thereof) shall apply   with respect to life insurance companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Foreign life insurance companies. Foreign life insurance  companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States  are not taxable under section 802, but are taxable as other foreign  corporations.

All provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code and of the regulations in this part not  inconsistent with the specific provisions of sections 801 to 820,  inclusive, are applicable to the assessment and collection of the tax  imposed by section 802(a), and life insurance companies are subject to  the same penalties as are provided in the case of returns and payment of  income tax by other corporations. The return shall be on Form 1120L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 802(a),  other than paragraph (3) thereof, and this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For the taxable year 1959, T, a life insurance company, has  life insurance company taxable income of $300,000 (including $25,000 of  net short-term capital gain) and $80,000 of net long-term capital gain.  The tax of T under section 802(a) for 1959 is $170,500 ($90,000 normal  tax, $60,500 surtax, and $20,000 capital gains tax) computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Computation of Normal Tax Life insurance company taxable income........................   $300,000 Normal tax (30% of $300,000).................................     90,000</p><p class="depth0">Computation of Surtax Life insurance company taxable income........................   $300,000 Less: Exemption from surtax..................................     25,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Excess of life insurance company taxable income subject      275,000</p><p class="depth0">to surtax...............................................

In the case of a taxable year of a life  insurance company ending after December 31, 1963, for which an election  under section 1562(a)(1) by a controlled group of corporations is  effective, the additional tax imposed by section 1562 may apply. See  section 1562 and the regulations thereunder.
