Sec. 211.212-2  Test hearing protector selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The test request will specify the number of test protectors which will be selected for testing from the number of

protectors delivered to the test facility in accordance with Sec. 211.212-1(c)(5). The remainder may be used as replacement protectors if replacement is necessary. The test request will also specify that the protectors be selected from the next batch scheduled for production after receipt of the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If random selection is specified, it must be achieved by sequentially numbering all the protectors in the group and then using a table of random numbers to select the test hearing protectors. The manufacturer may use an alternative random selection plan when it is approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each test protector of the category selected for testing must have been assembled, by the manufacturer, for distribution in commerce using the manufacturer's normal production process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> At their discretion, EPA Enforcement Officers, rather than the manufacturer, may select the protectors designated in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The manufacturer must keep on hand the test protectors designated for testing until such time as the category is determined to be in compliance. Hearing protectors actually tested and found to be in compliance with these regulations may be distributed in commerce.

Sec. 211.212-3  Test hearing protector preparation.</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer must select the test hearing protector according to Sec. 211.212-2 before the official test, and must comply with the test protector preparation requirements described in this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A test hearing protector selected according to Sec. 211.212-2 must not be tested, modified, or adjusted in any manner before the official test unless the adjustments, modifications and/or tests are part of the manufacturer's prescribed manufacturing and inspection procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Quality controls, testing, assembly or selection procedures must not be, used on the completed protector or any portion of the protector, including parts, that will not normally be used during the production and assembly of all other protectors of that category to be distributed in commerce.
[47 FR 57717, Dec. 28, 1982]


Sec. 211.212-4  Testing procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer must conduct one valid test according to the test procedures specified in Sec. 211.206 for each hearing protector selected for testing under Sec. 211.212-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer must not repair or adjust the test hearing protectors once compliance testing has been initiated. In the event a hearing protector is unable to complete the test, the manufacturer may replace the protector. Any replacement protector will be of the same category as the protector being replaced. It will be selected from the remaining designated test protectors and will be subject to all the provisions of these regulations. Any replacement and the reason for replacement must be reported in the compliance audit test report.

The manufacturer must obtain approval by showing that the relabeled values adequately take into account results achieved from the Compliance Audit Testing and product variability. The Administrator is to exercise his discretion in light of factors including the prior compliance record of the manufacturer, the adequacy of the proposed new labeling value, the amount of deviation of test results from the labeled values, and any other relevant information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the manufacturer can show that the non-compliance under Sec. 211.212-6 was caused by a quality control failure and that the failure has been remedied, he may, with the Administrator's approval, conduct an additional test and relabel using the mean attenuation values no higher than those obtained in that test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The manufacturer may request a hearing on the issue of whether the compliance audit testing was conducted properly and whether the criteria for non-compliance in Sec. 211.212-6 have been met; and the appropriateness or scope of a continued testing order. In the event that a hearing is requested, the hearing shall begin no later than 15 days after the date on which the Administrator received the hearing request. Neither the request

for a hearing, nor the fact that a hearing is in progress, shall affect the responsibility of the manufacturer to commence and continue testing required by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
