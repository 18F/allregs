                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever the employment of full-time students working outside of  school hours in agriculture or in a retail or service establishment at  wages lower than the minimum applicable under section 6 of the Fair  Labor Standards Act is believed to be necessary to prevent curtailment  of opportunities for employment and employment of them will not create a  substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment  opportunities of the other workers, an application for a certificate may  be filed by their employer with the appropriate Regional Office of the  Wage and Hour Division (or the Denver, Colorado Area Office for  Colorado, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Salt Lake City, Utah area  Office for Montana, Utah, and Wyoming; and the Caribbean Office for the  area it covers). Such application shall be signed by an authorized  representative of the employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application must be filed in duplicate on official forms or  exact copies thereof. The forms are available at the offices mentioned  in paragraph (a) of this section. The application must contain the  information as to the type of products sold or services rendered by the  establishment, hours of employment during the preceding twelve-month  period or data from previous certificates (or applications) as pertinent  to the application, and other information for which request is made on  the form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separate application must be made for each farm or establishment  in which authority to employ full-time students at subminimum wage rates  is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for renewal of a certificate shall be made either on  the same type of form as is used for a new   application or on an alternate official form. No certificate in effect  shall expire until action on such an application shall have been finally  determined, provided that such application has been properly executed,  and is received by the office specified in paragraph (a) of this section  not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the expiration date. A  properly executed application is one which fully and accurately contains  the information required on the form, and the required certification by  an authorized representative of the employer.</p>
