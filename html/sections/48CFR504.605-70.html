                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FPDS database. The General Services Administration awarded a  contract for creation and operation of the Federal Procurement Data  System (FPDS) database. That database includes information reported by  departments and agencies as required by FAR subpart 4.6. One of the  primary purposes of the FPDS database is to provide information on  Government procurement to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fee for direct hook-up. To the extent that a member of the  public requests establishment of real-time integration of reporting  services to run reports from another application, a one-time charge of  $2,500 for the original integration must be paid by the requestor. This  one-time charge covers the setup and certification required for an  integrator to access the FPDS database and for technical assistance to  help integrators use the web services. The fee will be paid to the FPDS  contractor and credited to invoices submitted to GSA by the FPDS  contractor.  [69 FR 77662, Dec. 28, 2004.
