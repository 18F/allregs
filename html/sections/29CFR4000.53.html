You may use electronic media to satisfy the  record maintenance and retention requirements of this chapter if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The electronic recordkeeping system has reasonable controls to  ensure the integrity, accuracy, authenticity and reliability of the  records kept in electronic form;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The electronic records are maintained in reasonable order and in  a safe and accessible place, and in such manner as they may be readily  inspected or examined (for example, the recordkeeping system should be  capable of indexing, retaining, preserving, retrieving and reproducing  the electronic records);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The electronic records are readily convertible into legible and  readable paper copy as may be needed to satisfy reporting and disclosure  requirements or any other obligation under section 302(f)(4), section  307(e), or Title IV of ERISA;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The electronic recordkeeping system is not subject, in whole or  in part, to any agreement or restriction that would, directly or  indirectly, compromise or limit a person's ability to comply with any  reporting and disclosure requirement or any other obligation under  section 302(f)(4), section 307(e), or Title IV of ERISA;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adequate records management practices are established and  implemented (for example, following procedures for labeling of  electronically maintained or retained records, providing a secure  storage environment, creating back-up electronic copies and selecting an  off-site storage location, observing a quality assurance program  evidenced by regular evaluations of the electronic recordkeeping system  including periodic checks of electronically maintained or retained  records; and retaining paper copies of records that cannot be clearly,  accurately or completely transferred to an electronic recordkeeping  system); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All electronic records exhibit a high degree of legibility and  readability when displayed on a video display terminal or other method  of electronic transmission and when reproduced in paper form. The term  ``legibility'' means the observer must be able to identify all letters  and numerals positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other  letters or numerals. The term ``readability'' means that the observer  must be able to recognize a group of letters or numerals as words or  complete numbers.</p>
