                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Microloan Program assists women, low income individuals,  minority entrepreneurs, and other small businesses which need small  amounts   of financial assistance. Under this program, SBA makes direct and  guaranteed loans to Intermediaries (as defined below) who use the  proceeds to make loans to eligible borrowers. SBA may also make grants  under the program to Intermediaries and other qualified nonprofit  entities to be used for marketing, management, and technical assistance  to the program's target population.
