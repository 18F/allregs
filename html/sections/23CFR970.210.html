The minimum BMS database shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data described by the inventory section of the National Bridge Inspection Standards (23 CFR part 650, subpart C);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data characterizing the severity and extent of deterioration of bridge elements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Data for estimating the cost of improvement actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Traffic information including volumes and other pertinent information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A history of conditions and actions taken on each bridge, excluding minor or incidental maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A system for applying network level analytical procedures that are capable of analyzing data for all bridges in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A prediction of performance and estimate of the remaining service life of structural and other key elements of each bridge, both with and without intervening actions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A recommendation for optimal allocation of limited funds through development of a prioritized list of candidate projects over predefined short and long term planning horizons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The BMS may include the capability to perform an investment analysis as appropriate, considering size of structure, traffic volume, and structural condition. The investment analysis may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify alternative strategies to improve bridge condition, safety and serviceability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimate the costs of any strategies ranging from maintenance of individual elements to full bridge replacement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for bridge elements using life cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide short and long term budget forecasting; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evaluate the cultural and historical values of the structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For any bridge in the inventory or subset thereof, BMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of non-deficient bridges.</p>
