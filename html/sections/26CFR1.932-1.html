                                Sec. 1.932-1  Coordination of United States and Virgin Islands income
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 932 and this section set forth  the special rules relating to the filing of income tax returns and  income tax liabilities of individuals described in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section. Paragraph (h) of this section also provides special rules  requiring consistent treatment of business entities in the United States  and in the United States Virgin Islands (Virgin Islands).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individuals covered. This section will apply to any individual  who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands during the entire  taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is a citizen or resident of the United States (other than a  bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands) during the entire taxable  year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has income derived from sources within the Virgin Islands, or  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the  Virgin Islands, for the taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Files a joint return for the taxable year with any individual  described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-1 will apply for determining whether an  individual is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-2 will apply for determining whether  income is from sources within the Virgin Islands; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-3 will apply for determining whether  income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business  within the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> U.S. individuals with Virgin Islands income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dual filing  requirement. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an individual  described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must make an income  tax return for the taxable year to the United States and file a copy of  such return with the Virgin Islands. Such individuals must also attach  Form 8689, ``Allocation of Individual Income Tax to the U.S. Virgin  Islands,'' to the U.S. income tax return and to the income tax return  filed with the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax payments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each individual to whom this paragraph (b)  applies for the taxable year must pay the applicable percentage of the  taxes imposed by this chapter for such taxable year (determined without  regard to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) to the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the  taxable year   will be allowed in an amount equal to the taxes that are required to be  paid to the Virgin Islands under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and  are so paid. Such taxes will be considered creditable in the same manner  as taxes paid to the United States (for example, under section 31) and  not as taxes paid to a foreign government (for example, under sections  27 and 901).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The term applicable percentage means the percentage that Virgin  Islands adjusted gross income bears to adjusted gross income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The term Virgin Islands adjusted gross income means adjusted  gross income determined by taking into account only income derived from  sources within the Virgin Islands and deductions properly apportioned or  allocable to such income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  rules of Sec. 1.861-8 will apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 1.937-2(a), the rules of Sec. 1.937-2(c)(1)(ii)  and (c)(2) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands. Subject to paragraph  (d) of this section, an individual described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section will be subject to the following income tax return filing  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Virgin Islands filing requirements. An individual to whom this  paragraph (c) applies must file an income tax return for the taxable  year with the Virgin Islands. On this return, the individual must report  income from all sources and identify the source of each item of income  shown on the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> U.S. filing requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of calculating the  income tax liability to the United States of an individual to whom this  paragraph (c) applies, gross income will not include any amount included  in gross income on the return filed with the Virgin Islands pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and deductions and credits allocable  to such income will not be taken into account, provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual fully satisfied the reporting requirements of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual fully paid the tax liability referred to in  section 934(a) to the Virgin Islands with respect to such income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> U.S. tax payments. In the case of an individual who is required  to file an income tax return with the United States as a consequence of  failing to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of  this section, there will be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed  by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the amount of  the tax liability referred to in section 934(a) to the extent paid to  the Virgin Islands. Such taxes shall be considered creditable in the  same manner as taxes paid to the United States (for example, under  section 31) and not as taxes paid to a foreign government   (for example, under sections 27 and 901).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Joint returns. In the case of married persons, if one or both  spouses is an individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  and they file a joint return of income tax, the spouses must file their  joint return with, and pay the tax due on such return to, the  jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) where the spouse who has the greater  adjusted gross income for the taxable year would be required under  paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to file a return if separate  returns were filed and all of their income were the income of such  spouse. For this purpose, adjusted gross income of each spouse is  determined under section 62 and the regulations under that section but  without regard to community property laws; and, if one of the spouses  dies, the taxable year of the surviving spouse will be treated as ending  on the date of such death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Place for filing returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> U.S. returns. Except as otherwise  provided for returns filed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a  return required under the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section to be filed with the United States must be filed as directed in  the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Virgin Islands returns. A return required under the rules of  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to be filed with the Virgin  Islands must be filed as directed in the applicable forms and  instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Tax accounting standards--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A dual filing taxpayer  must use the same tax accounting standards on the returns filed with the  United States and the Virgin Islands. A taxpayer who has filed a return  only with the United States or only with the Virgin Islands as a single  filing taxpayer for a prior taxable year and is required to file a  return only with the other jurisdiction as a single filing taxpayer for  a later taxable year may not, for such later taxable year, use different  tax accounting standards unless the second jurisdiction consents to such  change. However, such change will not be effective for returns filed  thereafter with the first jurisdiction unless before such later date of  filing the taxpayer also obtains the consent of the first jurisdiction  to make such change. Any request for consent to make a change pursuant  to this paragraph (f) must be made to the office where the return is  required to be filed under paragraph (e) of this section and in  sufficient time to permit a copy of the consent to be attached to the  return for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (f), the terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dual filing taxpayer means a taxpayer who is required to file  returns with the United States and the Virgin Islands for the same  taxable year under the rules of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section) for the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax accounting standards includes the taxpayer's accounting  period, methods of accounting, and any election to which the taxpayer is  bound with respect to the reporting of taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Extension of territory--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 932(a) taxpayers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. With respect to an individual to whom section 932(a)  applies for a taxable year, for purposes of taxes imposed by Chapter 1  of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the United States generally will be  treated, in a geographical and governmental sense, as including the  Virgin Islands. The purpose of this rule is to facilitate the  coordination of the tax systems of the United States and the Virgin  Islands. Accordingly, the rule will have no effect where it is  manifestly inapplicable or its application would be incompatible with  the intent of any provision of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of general rule. Contexts in which the general rule  of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section apply include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The characterization of taxes paid to the Virgin Islands. An  individual to whom section 932(a) applies may take income tax required  to be   paid to the Virgin Islands under section 932(b) into account under  sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b) as payments to the United States. Taxes  paid to the Virgin Islands and otherwise satisfying the requirements of  section 164(a) will be allowed as a deduction under that section, but  income taxes required to be paid to the Virgin Islands under section  932(b) will be disallowed as a deduction under section 275(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of the source of income for purposes of the  foreign tax credit (for example, sections 901 through 904). Thus, for  example, after an individual to whom section 932(a) applies determines  which items of income constitute income from sources within the Virgin  Islands under the rules of section 937(b), such income will be treated  as income from sources within the United States for purposes of section  904;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The eligibility of a corporation to make a subchapter S election  (sections 1361 through 1379). Thus, for example, for purposes of  determining whether a corporation created or organized in the Virgin  Islands may make an election under section 1362(a) to be a subchapter S  corporation, it will be treated as a domestic corporation and a  shareholder to whom section 932(a) applies will not be treated as a  nonresident alien individual with respect to such corporation. While  such an election is in effect, the corporation will be treated as a  domestic corporation for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. For  the consistency requirement with respect to entity status elections, see  paragraph (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The treatment of items carried over from other taxable years.  Thus, for example, if an individual to whom section 932(a) applies has  for a taxable year a net operating loss carryback or carryover under  section 172, a foreign tax credit carryback or carryover under section  904, a business credit carryback or carryover under section 39, a  capital loss carryover under section 1212, or a charitable contributions  carryover under section 170, the carryback or carryover will be reported  on the return filed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  even though the return of the taxpayer for the taxable year giving rise  to the carryback or carryover was required to be filed with the Virgin  Islands under section 932(c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The treatment of property exchanged for property of a like kind  (section 1031). Thus, for example, if an individual to whom section  932(a) applies exchanges real property located in the United States for  real property located in the Virgin Islands, notwithstanding the  provisions of section 1031(h), such exchange may qualify as a like-kind  exchange under section 1031 (provided that all the other requirements of  section 1031 are satisfied).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonapplication of the general rule. Contexts in which the  general rule of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section does not apply  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The application of any rules or regulations that explicitly  treat the United States and any (or all) of its possessions as separate  jurisdictions (for example, sections 931 through 937, 7651, and 7654).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of any aspect of an individual's residency  (for example, sections 937(a) and 7701(b)). Thus, for example, an  individual whose principal place of abode is in the Virgin Islands is  not considered to have a principal place of abode in the United States  for purposes of section 32(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The characterization of a corporation for purposes other than  subchapter S (for example, sections 367, 951 through 964, 1291 through  1298, 6038, and 6038B). Thus, for example, if an individual to whom  section 932(a) applies transfers appreciated tangible property to a  corporation created or organized in the Virgin Islands in a transaction  described in section 351, he or she must recognize gain unless an  exception under section 367(a) applies. Also, if a corporation created  or organized in the Virgin Islands qualifies as a passive foreign  investment company under sections 1297 and 1298 with respect to an  individual to whom section 932(a) applies, a dividend paid to such  shareholder does not constitute qualified dividend income under section  1(h)(11)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 932(c) taxpayers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. With respect to an  individual to whom section 932(c) applies for a taxable year, for  purposes of the territorial income tax of the Virgin Islands   (that is, mirrored sections of the Code), the Virgin Islands generally  will be treated, in a geographical and governmental sense, as including  the United States. The purpose of this rule is to facilitate the  coordination of the tax systems of the United States and the Virgin  Islands. Accordingly, the rule will have no effect where it is  manifestly inapplicable or its application would be incompatible with  the intent of any provision of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of general rule. Contexts in which the general rule  of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section apply include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The characterization of taxes paid to the United States. A  taxpayer described in section 932(c)(1) may take income tax paid to the  United States into account under mirrored sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b)  as payments to the Virgin Islands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of the source of income for purposes of the  foreign tax credit (for example, mirrored sections 901 through 904).  Thus, for example, any item of income that constitutes income from  sources within the United States under the rules of sections 861 through  865 will be treated as income from sources within the Virgin Islands for  purposes of mirrored section 904;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The eligibility of a corporation to make a subchapter S election  (mirrored sections 1361 through 1379). Thus, for example, for purposes  of determining whether a corporation created or organized in the United  States may make an election under mirrored section 1362(a) to be a  subchapter S corporation, it will be treated as a domestic corporation  and a shareholder to whom section 932(c) applies will not be treated as  a nonresident alien individual with respect to such corporation. While  such an election is in effect, the corporation will be treated as a  domestic corporation for all purposes of the territorial income tax. For  the consistency requirement with respect to entity status elections, see  paragraph (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The treatment of items carried over from other taxable years.  Thus, for example, if an individual to whom section 932(c) applies has  for a taxable year a net operating loss carryback or carryover under  mirrored section 172, a foreign tax credit carryback or carryover under  mirrored section 904, a business credit carryback or carryover under  mirrored section 39, a capital loss carryover under mirrored section  1212, or a charitable contributions carryover under mirrored section  170, the carryback or carryover will be reported on the return filed in  accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, even though the return  of the taxpayer for the taxable year giving rise to the carryback or  carryover was required to be filed with the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The treatment of property exchanged for property of a like kind  (mirrored section 1031). Thus, for example, if an individual to whom  section 932(c) applies exchanges real property located in the United  States for real property located in the Virgin Islands, notwithstanding  the provisions of mirrored section 1031(h), such exchange may qualify as  a like-kind exchange under mirrored section 1031 (provided that all the  other requirements of mirrored section 1031 are satisfied).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonapplication of general rule. Contexts in which the general  rule of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section does not apply include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The determination of any aspect of an individual's residency  (for example, mirrored section 7701(b)). Thus, for example, an  individual whose principal place of abode is in the United States is not  considered to have a principal place of abode in the Virgin Islands for  purposes of mirrored section 32(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of the source of income for purposes other  than the foreign tax credit (for example, sections 932(a) and (b),  934(b), and 937). Thus, for example, compensation for services performed  in the United States and rentals or royalties from property located in  the United States do not constitute income from sources within the  Virgin Islands for purposes of section 934(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The definition of wages (mirrored section 3401). Thus, for  example, services performed by an employee for an employer in the United  States do not constitute services performed in the Virgin Islands under  mirrored section 3401(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Entity status consistency requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Taxpayers  should make consistent entity status elections (as defined in paragraph  (h)(3) of this section), where applicable, in both the United States and  the Virgin Islands. In the case of a business entity to which this  paragraph (h) applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an entity status election is filed with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) but not with the Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal Revenue  (BIR), the Director of the BIR or his delegate, at his discretion, may  deem the election also to have been made for Virgin Islands tax  purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an entity status election is filed with the BIR but not with  the IRS, the Commissioner, at his discretion, may deem the election also  to have been made for Federal tax purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If inconsistent entity status elections are filed with the BIR  and the IRS, both the Commissioner and the Director of the BIR or his  delegate may, at their individual discretion, treat the elections they  each received as invalid and may deem the election filed in the other  jurisdiction to have been made also for tax purposes in their own  jurisdiction. See Rev. Proc. 2006-23 (2006-1 CB 900) (see  Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for procedures for requesting  the assistance of the IRS when a taxpayer is or may be subject to  inconsistent tax treatment by the IRS and a U.S. possession tax agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scope. This paragraph (h) applies to the following business  entities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A business entity (as defined in Sec. 301.7701-2(a) of this  chapter) that is domestic (as defined in Sec. 301.7701-5 of this  chapter), or otherwise treated as domestic for purposes of the Code, and  that is owned in whole or in part by any person who is either a bona  fide resident of the Virgin Islands or a business entity created or  organized in the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A business entity that is created or organized in the Virgin  Islands and that is owned in whole or in part by any U.S. person (other  than a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, the term entity status  election includes an election under Sec. 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter,  an election under section 1362(a), and any other similar elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Default status. Solely for the purpose of determining  classification of an eligible entity under Sec. 301.7701-3(b) of this  chapter and under that section as mirrored in the Virgin Islands, an  eligible entity subject to this paragraph (h) will be classified for  both Federal and Virgin Islands tax purposes using the rule that applies  to domestic eligible entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an election filed prior to  April 11, 2005, except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this  section, the rules of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will apply as of  the first day of the first taxable year of the entity beginning after  April 11, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the unlikely circumstance that inconsistent elections  described in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section are filed prior to  April 11, 2005, and the entity cannot change its classification to  achieve consistency because of the sixty-month limitation described in  Sec. 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv) of this chapter, then the entity may  nevertheless request permission from the Commissioner or the Director of  the BIR or his delegate to change such election to avoid inconsistent  treatment by the Commissioner and the Director of the BIR or his  delegate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(5)(i) and (h)(5)(ii) of  this section, in the case of an election filed with respect to an entity  before it became an entity described in paragraph (h)(2) of this  section, the rules of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will apply as of  the first day that such entity is described in paragraph (h)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of an entity created or organized prior to April  11, 2005, paragraph (h)(4) of this section will take effect for Federal  income tax purposes (or Virgin Islands income tax purposes, as the case  may be) as of the first day of the first taxable year of the entity  beginning after April 11, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A is a U.S. citizen who resides in State R. For 2008,  A files with the   IRS a Form 1040, ``U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,'' reporting  adjusted gross income of $90x, which includes $30x from sources in the  Virgin Islands. The income tax liability reported on A's Form 1040 is  $18x. A files a copy of his Form 1040 with the Virgin Islands as  required by section 932(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A  pays to the Virgin Islands the applicable percentage of his Federal  income tax liability as required by section 932(b) and paragraph (b)(2)  of this section, computed as follows: $30x/$90x x $18x = $6x income tax  liability to the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A claims a credit in the amount of $6x against his Federal  income tax liability reported on his Form 1040. A attaches a Form 8689,  ``Allocation of Individual Income Tax to the U.S. Virgin Islands,'' to  the Form 1040 filed with the IRS and to the copy filed with the Virgin  Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B, a U.S. citizen, files returns on a calendar year  basis. In November 2008, B moves to the Virgin Islands, purchases a  house, and accepts a permanent position with a local employer. For the  remainder of the year and throughout 2009, B continues to live and work  in the Virgin Islands and has a closer connection to the Virgin Islands  than to the United States or any foreign country. As a consequence of  his employment in the Virgin Islands, B earns income from the  performance of services in the Virgin Islands during 2008 and 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 2008, B does not qualify as a bona fide resident under  section 937(a) and Sec. 1.937-1(b) and (f)(1). Therefore, B is subject  to the rules of sections 932(a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of this  section for 2008 because he has income derived from sources within the  Virgin Islands as determined under the rules of section 937(b) and  Sec. 1.937-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 2009, assuming that B otherwise satisfies the requirements  of section 937(a) and Sec. 1.937-1(b), B qualifies as a bona fide  resident of the Virgin Islands. Therefore, section 932(c) and paragraph  (c) of this section apply to B for 2009, and he must file his income tax  return with the Virgin Islands under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.  Provided that B fully satisfies the reporting requirements of paragraph  (c)(1) of this section and fully pays the tax liability referred to in  section 934(a), B will have no Federal income tax filing requirement or  liability under paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. H and W are U.S. citizens. H resides in State T and W is  a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands. For 2008, H and W prepare a  joint Form 1040, ``U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,'' reporting total  adjusted gross income of $75x, of which $40x is attributable to  compensation that W received for services performed in the Virgin  Islands and $35x to compensation that H received for services performed  in State T. Pursuant to section 932(d) and paragraph (d) of this  section, because W would have the greater adjusted gross income if  computed separately, H and W must file their joint Form 1040 with the  Virgin Islands as required by section 932(c) and paragraph (c)(1) of  this section. H and W may claim a tax credit on such return for income  tax withheld during 2008 and paid to the IRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that H  also earns $25x for services performed in the Virgin Islands, so that H  and W's total adjusted gross income is $100x, and their total income tax  liability is $20x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to section 932(d) and paragraph (d) of this section,  because H would have the greater adjusted gross income if computed  separately, H and W must file their joint Form 1040 with the IRS and  must file a copy of that joint Form 1040 with the Virgin Islands as  required by section 932(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. H  and W must pay the applicable percentage of their Federal income tax  liability to the Virgin Islands as required by section 932(b) and  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, computed as follows: $65x /$100x x  $20x = $13x income tax liability to the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> H and W claim a credit against their Federal income tax  liability reported on their joint Form 1040 in the amount of $13x, the  portion of their Federal income tax liability required to be paid to the  Virgin Islands. H and W attach a Form 8689, ``Allocation of Individual  Income Tax to the U.S. Virgin Islands,'' to their joint Form 1040 filed  with the IRS and to the copy filed with the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. N, a U.S. citizen and calendar year taxpayer, takes the  position that he is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands for the  2007 taxable year. On April 15, 2008, N files a Form 1040, ``U.S.  Individual Income Tax Return,'' with the Virgin Islands for his 2007  taxable year. N does not file a Form 1040 with the IRS. Because there is  an agreement in force between the United States and the Virgin Islands  for the routine exchange of income tax information, under paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Federal 3-year period of limitations  under section 6501(a) will expire on April 15, 2011, and the IRS will  make no further assessment of income tax after that date for N's 2007  taxable year except as otherwise authorized by section 6501.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> J is a U.S. citizen and a bona fide resident of the  Virgin Islands. In 2008, J receives compensation for services performed  as an employee in the Virgin Islands in the amount of $40x. J files with  the Virgin Islands a Form 1040, ``U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,''  reporting gross income of only $30x. Based on these facts, J has not  satisfied the conditions of section 932(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of this  section for an exclusion from gross income for Federal income tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 6  except that on or before the last day prescribed for filing an income  tax return for J's 2008 taxable year, J files with the Virgin Islands an  amended Form 1040 for 2008, correctly reporting the full $40x of  compensation. Provided that J otherwise fully satisfies the reporting  requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and fully pays the tax  liability referred to in section 934(a), J will have no Federal income  tax filing requirement or liability under paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> N is a U.S. citizen and a bona fide resident of the  Virgin Islands. In 2008, N receives compensation for services performed  in Country M. N files with the Virgin Islands a Form 1040, ``U.S.  Individual Income Tax Return,'' reporting the compensation as income  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  Virgin Islands. N claims a special credit against the tax on this  compensation pursuant to a Virgin Islands law enacted within the limits  of its authority under section 934.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the principles of section 864(c)(4) as applied pursuant  to section 937(b)(1) and Sec. 1.937-3(b), compensation for services  performed outside the Virgin Islands may not be treated as income  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  Virgin Islands for purposes of section 934(b). Consequently, N is not  entitled to claim the special credit under Virgin Islands law with  respect to N's income from services performed in Country M. Because N  has not fully paid his tax liability referred to in section 934(a), he  has not satisfied the conditions of section 932(c)(4) and paragraph (c)  of this section for an exclusion from gross income for Federal income  tax purposes. Therefore, income reported on the Form 1040 as filed with  the Virgin Islands must be included in N's Federal gross income. Under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of tax paid to the Virgin  Islands on such income will be allowed as a credit against N's Federal  income tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em>, this section applies to taxable years ending after  April 9, 2008. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of  this section to open taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2006.
