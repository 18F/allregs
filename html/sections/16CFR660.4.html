                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a furnisher must conduct a reasonable investigation of a direct dispute if it relates to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consumer's liability for a credit account or other debt with the furnisher, such as direct disputes relating to whether there is or has been identity theft or fraud against the consumer, whether there is individual or

joint liability on an account, or whether the consumer is an authorized user of a credit account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms of a credit account or other debt with the furnisher, such as direct disputes relating to the type of account, principal balance, scheduled payment amount on an account, or the amount of the credit limit on an open-end account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The consumer's performance or other conduct concerning an account or other relationship with the furnisher, such as direct disputes relating to the current payment status, high balance, date a payment was made, the amount of a payment made, or the date an account was opened or closed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other information contained in a consumer report regarding an account or other relationship with the furnisher that bears on the consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to a furnisher if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The direct dispute relates to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consumer's identifying information (other than a direct dispute relating to a consumer's liability for a credit account or other debt with the furnisher, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) such as name(s), date of birth, Social Security number, telephone number(s), or address(es);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of past or present employers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inquiries or requests for a consumer report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information derived from public records, such as judgments, bankruptcies, liens, and other legal matters (unless provided by a furnisher with an account or other relationship with the consumer);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information related to fraud alerts or active duty alerts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information provided to a consumer reporting agency by another furnisher; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The furnisher has a reasonable belief that the direct dispute is submitted by, is prepared on behalf of the consumer by, or is submitted on a form supplied to the consumer by, a credit repair organization, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1679a(3), or an entity that would be a credit repair organization, but for 15 U.S.C. 1679a(3)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Direct dispute address. A furnisher is required to investigate a direct dispute only if a consumer submits a dispute notice to the furnisher at:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The address of a furnisher provided by a furnisher and set forth on a consumer report relating to the consumer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An address clearly and conspicuously specified by the furnisher for submitting direct disputes that is provided to the consumer in writing or electronically (if the consumer has agreed to the electronic delivery of information from the furnisher); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any business address of the furnisher if the furnisher has not so specified and provided an address for submitting direct disputes under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Direct dispute notice contents. A dispute notice must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sufficient information to identify the account or other relationship that is in dispute, such as an account number and the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer, if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific information that the consumer is disputing and an explanation of the basis for the dispute; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All supporting documentation or other information reasonably required by the furnisher to substantiate the basis of the dispute. This documentation may include, for example: a copy of the relevant portion of the consumer report that contains the allegedly inaccurate information; a police report; a fraud or identity theft affidavit; a court order; or account statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duty of furnisher after receiving a direct dispute notice. After receiving a dispute notice from a consumer pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the furnisher must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a reasonable investigation with respect to the disputed information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review all relevant information provided by the consumer with the dispute notice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Complete its investigation of the dispute and report the results of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period under section

611(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681i(a)(1)) within which a consumer reporting agency would be required to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the information under that section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the investigation finds that the information reported was inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the furnisher provided inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the consumer reporting agency any correction to that information that is necessary to make the information provided by the furnisher accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Frivolous or irrelevant disputes. (1) A furnisher is not required to investigate a direct dispute if the furnisher has reasonably determined that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A dispute qualifies as frivolous or irrelevant if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A furnisher is not required to investigate a direct dispute if the furnisher has reasonably determined that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A dispute qualifies as frivolous or irrelevant if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consumer did not provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information as required by paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The direct dispute is substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted by or on behalf of the consumer, either directly to the furnisher or through a consumer reporting agency, with respect to which the furnisher has already satisfied the applicable requirements of the Act or this section; provided, however, that a direct dispute is not substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted if the dispute includes information listed in paragraph (d) of this section that had not previously been provided to the furnisher; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The furnisher is not required to investigate the direct dispute because one or more of the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of determination. Upon making a determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, the furnisher must notify the consumer of the determination not later than five business days after making the determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the furnisher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contents of notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant must include the reasons for such determination and identify any information required to investigate the disputed information, which notice may consist of a standardized form describing the general nature of such information.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Section 660.3 of this part requires each furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information it furnishes to consumer reporting agencies. Under Sec. 660.3(b), a furnisher must consider the guidelines set forth below in developing its policies and procedures. In establishing these policies and procedures, a furnisher may include any of its existing policies and procedures that are relevant and appropriate. Section 660.3(c) requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0">I. Nature, Scope, and Objectives of Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nature and Scope. Section 660.3(a) of this part requires that a furnisher's policies and procedures be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's activities. In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should consider, for example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The types of business activities in which the furnisher engages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature and frequency of the information the furnisher provides to consumer reporting agencies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The technology used by the furnisher to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objectives. A furnisher's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to promote the following objectives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate, such that the furnished information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifies the appropriate consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reflects the terms of and liability for those accounts or other relationships; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reflects the consumer's performance and other conduct with respect to the account or other relationship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity, such that the furnished information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is substantiated by the furnisher's records at the time it is furnished;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is furnished in a form and manner that is designed to minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly reflected in a consumer report; thus, the furnished information should:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Include appropriate identifying information about the consumer to whom it pertains; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Be furnished in a standardized and clearly understandable form and manner and with a date specifying the time period to which the information pertains; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Includes the credit limit, if applicable and in the furnisher's possession;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes and take appropriate actions based on the outcome of such investigations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To update the information it furnishes as necessary to reflect the current status of the consumer's account or other relationship, including, for example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any transfer of an account (e.g., by sale or assignment for collection) to a third party; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any cure of the consumer's failure to abide by the terms of the account or other relationship.</p><p class="depth0">II. Establishing and Implementing Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In establishing and implementing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identify practices or activities of the furnisher that can compromise the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reviewing its existing practices and activities, including the technological means and other methods it uses to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies and the frequency and timing of its furnishing of information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing its historical records relating to accuracy or integrity or to disputes; reviewing other information relating to the accuracy or integrity of information provided by the furnisher to consumer reporting agencies; and considering the types of errors, omissions, or other problems that may have affected the accuracy or integrity of information it has furnished about consumers to consumer reporting agencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Considering any feedback received from consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtaining feedback from the furnisher's staff; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Considering the potential impact of the furnisher's policies and procedures on consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and procedures of the furnisher regarding the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies; consider whether new, additional, or different policies and procedures are necessary; and consider whether implementation of existing policies and procedures should be modified to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluate the effectiveness of specific methods (including technological means) the furnisher uses to provide information to consumer reporting agencies; how those methods may affect the accuracy and integrity of the information it provides to consumer reporting agencies; and whether new, additional, or different methods (including technological means) should be used to provide information to consumer reporting agencies to enhance the accuracy and integrity of that information.</p><p class="depth0">III. Specific Components of Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should address the following, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishing and implementing a system for furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies that is appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's business operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Using standard data reporting formats and standard procedures for compiling and furnishing data, where feasible, such as the electronic transmission of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintaining records for a reasonable period of time, not less than any applicable recordkeeping requirement, in order to substantiate the accuracy of any information about consumers it furnishes that is subject to a direct dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establishing and implementing appropriate internal controls regarding the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by implementing standard procedures and verifying random samples of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Training staff that participates in activities related to the furnishing of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies to implement the policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Providing for appropriate and effective oversight of relevant service providers whose activities may affect the accuracy or integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies following mergers, portfolio acquisitions or sales, or other acquisitions or transfers of

accounts or other obligations in a manner that prevents re-aging of information, duplicative reporting, or other problems that may similarly affect the accuracy or integrity of the information furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Deleting, updating, and correcting information in the furnisher's records, as appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Conducting reasonable investigations of disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Designing technological and other means of communication with consumer reporting agencies to prevent duplicative reporting of accounts, erroneous association of information with the wrong consumer(s), and other occurrences that may compromise the accuracy or integrity of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Providing consumer reporting agencies with sufficient identifying information in the furnisher's possession about each consumer about whom information is furnished to enable the consumer reporting agency properly to identify the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Conducting a periodic evaluation of its own practices, consumer reporting agency practices of which the furnisher is aware, investigations of disputed information, corrections of inaccurate information, means of communication, and other factors that may affect the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Complying with applicable requirements under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing regulations.</p>
