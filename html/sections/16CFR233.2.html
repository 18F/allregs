                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Another commonly used form of bargain advertising is to offer  goods at   prices lower than those being charged by others for the same merchandise  in the advertiser's trade area (the area in which he does business).  This may be done either on a temporary or a permanent basis, but in  either case the advertised higher price must be based upon fact, and not  be fictitious or misleading. Whenever an advertiser represents that he  is selling below the prices being charged in his area for a particular  article, he should be reasonably certain that the higher price he  advertises does not appreciably exceed the price at which substantial  sales of the article are being made in the area--that is, a sufficient  number of sales so that a consumer would consider a reduction from the  price to represent a genuine bargain or saving. Expressed another way,  if a number of the principal retail outlets in the area are regularly  selling Brand X fountain pens at $10, it is not dishonest for retailer  Doe to advertise: ``Brand X Pens, Price Elsewhere $10, Our Price  $7.50''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following example, however, illustrates a misleading use of  this advertising technique. Retailer Doe advertises Brand X pens as  having a ``Retail Value $15.00, My Price $7.50,'' when the fact is that  only a few small suburban outlets in the area charge $15. All of the  larger outlets located in and around the main shopping areas charge  $7.50, or slightly more or less. The advertisement here would be  deceptive, since the price charged by the small suburban outlets would  have no real significance to Doe's customers, to whom the advertisement  of ``Retail Value $15.00'' would suggest a prevailing, and not merely an  isolated and unrepresentative, price in the area in which they shop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A closely related form of bargain advertising is to offer a  reduction from the prices being charged either by the advertiser or by  others in the advertiser's trade area for other merchandise of like  grade and quality--in other words, comparable or competing merchandise-- to that being advertised. Such advertising can serve a useful and  legitimate purpose when it is made clear to the consumer that a  comparison is being made with other merchandise and the other  merchandise is, in fact, of essentially similar quality and obtainable  in the area. The advertiser should, however, be reasonably certain, just  as in the case of comparisons involving the same merchandise, that the  price advertised as being the price of comparable merchandise does not  exceed the price at which such merchandise is being offered by  representative retail outlets in the area. For example, retailer Doe  advertises Brand X pen as having ``Comparable Value $15.00''. Unless a  reasonable number of the principal outlets in the area are offering  Brand Y, an essentially similar pen, for that price, this advertisement  would be deceptive. [Guide II]</p>
