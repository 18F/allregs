Sec. 5511.1 to 5511.1-4 and Sec. 5511.2.


Sec. 5511.3-2  Permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application for permit. An application for permit in duplicate, must be made on a form approved by the Director and filed in any office or with any employee of the Bureau of Land Management authorized to issue a permit. A free-use permit may be applied for without formal application for the removal of not more than three Christmas trees upon oral or written request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Issuance and cancellation of free-use permits; bond. (1) A free-use permit, on a form approved by the Director, shall incorporate the provisions, if any, governing the selection, removal, and use of timber. Free-use permits shall not be issued when the applicant owns or controls an adequate supply of the material to meet his needs. Timber applied for must be for the applicant's own use and may not be bartered or sold. No timber may be cut or removed until the permit is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The authorized officer may cancel a permit if the permittee fails to observe its terms and conditions or the regulations, or if the permit has been issued erroneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A bond satisfactory to the authorized officer may be required as a guarantee of faithful performance of the provisions of the permit and applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A free-use permit issued under this part may not be assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Duration, extension, and termination of permit. (1) Permits shall be granted for periods not to exceed 6 months and shall terminate on the expiration dates shown therein unless extended by the authorized officer. An extension not to exceed 3 months may be granted by the authorized officer. The permittee must notify the officer-in-charge upon the completion of removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permits issued for the benefit of a mining claimant under authority of the act shall terminate upon transfer of the ownership of the claim by any means. Reapplication must be made by the new claimants.


Sec. 5511.3-3  Conservation practices.</p><p class="depth0">All free-use timber disposed of under the act shall be severed, or removed in accordance with sound forestry and conservation practices so as to preserve to the maximum extent feasible all scenic, recreational, watershed and other values of the land and resources. In the free-use disposal of timber, cutting and removal shall be accomplished in such a manner as to leave the stand in condition for continuous production.


Sec. 5511.3-4  Removal by agent.</p><p class="depth0">A free-use permittee may procure the timber by agent. Such agent shall not, however, be paid more than fair compensation for the time, labor and money expended in procuring timber and processing it, and no charge shall be made by such agent for the timber itself. No part of the timber may be used in payment for services in obtaining it or processing it.


Sec. 5511.3-5  Removal of improvements.</p><p class="depth0">Upon expiration of the permit period the permittee will be given 90 days to remove equipment, personal property and any improvements he has placed on the land, except roads, culverts and bridges are to be left in place, in good condition and will become the property of the United States upon expiration of the 90-day removal period.


Sec. 5511.3-6  Permits to governmental units.</p><p class="depth0">A free-use permit may be issued to a Federal or State agency, unit, or subdivision, including a municipality, only if the applicant makes a satisfactory showing to the authorized officer that such timber will be used for a public project. The right to remove timber under the permit is not revoked or terminated by (a) any subsequent claim or entry of the lands, (b) by any mining claim located prior to the issuance of the permit if such location was subsequent to July 23, 1955, nor (c) by any other mining claim as to which the Government's right to manage the surface resources has been established in accordance with Group 3800 of this chapter, or other proceedings.


Sec. 5511.3-7  Permits to nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="depth0">A free-use permit issued to a nonprofit association or corporation may not provide for the disposition of more than $100 worth of timber to the permittee during any one calendar year. Such permittee is granted a right to remove timber as against a subsequent applicant who may wish to obtain the same timber by purchase. The timber may not be removed by the permittee after the land has been included in a valid claim by reason of settlement, entry, or similar rights obtained under the public land laws.


Sec. 5511.3-8  Permits to mining claimants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Free-use timber shall be granted under Sec. 5510.0-3(b) to the record owner of a valid mining claim if such claim was located subsequent to July 23, 1955, or if the Government's right to manage the surface resources has been established in accordance with Group 3400 of this chapter, and he requires more timber than is available to him for prospecting, mining, or processing operations on his claim or claims after disposition of timber from his claim by the United States. The claimant shall be entitled to the free use of timber for such requirements from the nearest timber administered by the Bureau which is substantially equal in kind and quantity to the timber estimated by the authorized officer at the time of application to have been disposed of by the Bureau from the claim. Upon issuance of a patent to the mining claims, the free-use privilege will automatically terminate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The application required to be filed for free-use timber under this section must contain a statement that the timber applied for will be used for bona fide prospecting, mining, or prospecting operations on the claim or group of claims designated in the application.
