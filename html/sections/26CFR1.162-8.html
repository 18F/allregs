                            <p class="depth0">The income tax liability of the recipient in respect of an amount  ostensibly paid to him as compensation, but not allowed to be deducted  as such by the payor, will depend upon the circumstances of each case.  Thus, in the case of excessive payments by corporations, if such  payments correspond or bear a close relationship to stockholdings, and  are found to be a distribution of earnings or profits, the excessive  payments will be treated as a dividend. If such payments constitute  payment for property, they should be treated by the payor as a capital  expenditure and by the recipient as part of the purchase price. In the  absence of evidence to justify other treatment, excessive payments for  salaries or other compensation for personal services will be included in  gross income of the recipient.</p>
