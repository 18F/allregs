                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The requirement to make available coverage as provided in Sec. 50.20 applies to policies in existence on November 26, 2002, and new policies issued and renewals of existing policies during the period beginning on November 26, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2002, and in any Program Year thereafter. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the requirement applies at the time an insurer makes the initial offer of coverage as well as at the time an insurer makes an initial offer of renewal of an existing policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Offer consistent with amended definition of act of terrorism. An insurer must make available coverage for insured losses in a policy of property and casualty insurance consistent with the definition of an act of terrorism as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 beginning with the first initial offer of coverage or offer of renewal of the policy made on or after December 26, 2007. Notwithstanding this requirement, if an insurer makes an offer of coverage on or after December 26, 2007 on a policy that is in mid term, then the insurer must make available coverage for insured losses consistent with the definition of an act of terrorism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rules concerning extension of Program. (1) Special Program Year 4 requirement for certain new policies issued and renewals of existing policies in Program Year 3. If coverage for insured losses under a policy of property and casualty insurance (as defined by the Act, as amended) expired as of December 31, 2005, but the remainder of coverage under the policy continued in force in Program Year 4, then an insurer must make available coverage as provided in Sec. 50.20 for insured losses for the remaining portion of the policy term in the manner specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. This requirement does not apply if during Program Year 3 a policyholder declined an offer of coverage for insured losses made at the time of the initial offer of coverage or offer of renewal of the existing policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special Program Year 4 requirement for certain new policies issued and renewals of existing policies in Program Year 3. If coverage for insured losses under a policy of property and casualty insurance (as defined by the Act, as amended) expired as of December 31, 2005, but the remainder of coverage under the policy continued in force in Program Year 4, then an insurer must make available coverage as provided in Sec. 50.20 for insured losses for the remaining portion of the policy term in the manner specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. This requirement does not apply if during Program Year 3 a policyholder declined an offer of coverage for insured losses made at the time of the initial offer of coverage or offer of renewal of the existing policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special 2008 requirement for certain policies where coverage expired. If coverage for insured losses under a policy of property and casualty insurance expired as of December 31, 2007, but the remainder of coverage under the policy continued in force in 2008, then an insurer must make available coverage as provided in Sec. 50.20 for insured losses for the remaining portion of the policy term in the manner specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) of this section. However, if a policyholder declined an offer made by an insurer for such coverage expiring as of December 31, 2007, then the insurer is not required to make a new offer of coverage for insured losses before any offer of renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Changes negotiated subsequent to initial offer. If an insurer satisfies the requirement to ``make available'' coverage as described in Sec. 50.20 by first

making an offer with coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism, which the policyholder declines, the insurer may negotiate with the policyholder an option of partial coverage for insured losses at a lower amount of coverage if permitted by any applicable State law. An insurer is not required by the Act to offer partial coverage if the policyholder declines full coverage. See Sec. 50.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Demonstrations of compliance. (1) No contract. If an insurer makes an offer of insurance but no contract of insurance is concluded, the insurer may demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to make available coverage as described in Sec. 50.20 through use of appropriate systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No contract. If an insurer makes an offer of insurance but no contract of insurance is concluded, the insurer may demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to make available coverage as described in Sec. 50.20 through use of appropriate systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Policy periods beginning in Program Year 3. If an insurer must make available coverage for insured losses as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a policy whose coverage period began in Program Year 3 but extends into Program Year 4, then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has offered such coverage by January 1, 2006, or as soon as possible following that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coverage becoming effective in Program Year 4. If an insurer processed a new policy or policy renewal in Program Year 3 for coverage becoming effective in Program Year 4, but did not make available coverage for insured losses as required by Sec. 50.20 by January 1, 2006, then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided an offer of coverage for insured losses as soon as possible following that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Coverage expired as of December 31, 2007. If an insurer must make available coverage for insured losses under the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has offered such coverage as soon as possible following January 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Coverage becoming effective in 2008. (i) No coverage. If an insurer processed a new policy or policy renewal in 2007 or in the first three months of 2008 for coverage becoming effective in 2008, but did not make available coverage for insured losses as required by Sec. 50.20(a), then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided an offer of coverage for insured losses as soon as possible following January 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No coverage. If an insurer processed a new policy or policy renewal in 2007 or in the first three months of 2008 for coverage becoming effective in 2008, but did not make available coverage for insured losses as required by Sec. 50.20(a), then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided an offer of coverage for insured losses as soon as possible following January 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not consistent with amended definition of act of terrorism. If an insurer made an initial offer of coverage or offer of renewal on or after December 26, 2007 for a policy term becoming effective in 2008, and made available coverage for insured losses, but the scope of the coverage for insured losses in the offer was not consistent with the definition of an act of terrorism as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided a new offer of coverage as soon as possible following January 1, 2008. If an insurer made an initial offer of coverage or offer of renewal before December 26, 2007, for a policy term becoming effective in 2008, and the insurer made available coverage for insured losses in compliance with the Act and the definition of an act of terrorism in effect at the time of the offer, then the insurer is not required to make a new offer of coverage before the policy is due to be renewed by its terms, regardless of whether the offer was accepted or rejected.
