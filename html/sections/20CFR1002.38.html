                                Sec. 1002.38  Can a hiring hall be an employer?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes. In certain occupations (for example, longshoreman, stagehand,  construction worker), the employee may frequently work for many  different employers. A hiring hall operated by a union or an employer  association typically assigns the employee to the jobs. In these  industries, it may not be unusual for the employee to work his or her  entire career in a series of short-term job assignments. The definition  of ``employer'' includes a person, institution, organization, or other  entity to which the employer has delegated the performance of  employment-related responsibilities. A hiring hall therefore is  considered the employee's employer if the hiring and job assignment  functions have been delegated by an employer to the hiring hall. As the  employer, a hiring hall has reemployment responsibilities to its  employees. USERRA's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions  also apply to the hiring hall.</p>
