As stated in Sec. 238.229, all such passenger equipment remains subject to the safety appliance requirements contained in Federal statute at 49 U.S.C. chapter 203 and in FRA regulations at part 231 and Sec. 232.2 of this chapter. Unless otherwise specified, these requirements only apply to passenger equipment ordered on or after September 8, 2000 or placed in service for the first time on or after September 9, 2002.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart contains requirements for railroad passenger equipment operating at speeds not exceeding 125 miles per hour.

Passenger equipment of special design shall be deemed to comply with this subpart, other than Sec. 238.203, for the service environment in which the petitioner proposes to operate the equipment if the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety determines under paragraph (c) of this section that the equipment provides at least an equivalent level of safety in such environment with respect to the protection of its occupants from serious injury in the case of a derailment or collision. In making a determination under paragraph (c) the Associate Administrator shall consider, as a whole, all of those elements of casualty prevention or mitigation relevant to the integrity of the equipment that are addressed by the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The Associate Administrator may only make a finding of equivalent safety and compliance with this subpart, other than Sec. 238.203, based upon a submission of data and analysis sufficient to support that determination.
