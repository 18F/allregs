                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to you if you are subject to this program under  Sec. 49.153(a) for the construction of a new minor source, synthetic  minor source or a modification at an existing source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (3) of this section govern the content of your  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General provisions for permit applications. The following  provisions apply to permit applications under this program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reviewing authority may develop permit application forms for  your use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The permit application need not contain information on the  exempt emissions units and activities listed in Sec. 49.153(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The permit application for a modification need only include  information on the affected emissions units as defined in  Sec. 49.152(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (ix) of this section  in your application for a permit under this program. The reviewing  authority may require additional information as needed to process the  permit application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifying information, including your name and address (and  plant name and address if different) and the name and telephone number  of the plant manager/contact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of your source's processes and products.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A list of all affected emissions units (with the exception of  the exempt emissions units and activities listed in Sec. 49.153(c)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each new emissions unit that is listed, the potential to  emit of each regulated NSR pollutant in tpy (including fugitive  emissions, to the extent that they are quantifiable, if the emissions  unit or source is in one of the   source categories listed in part 51, Appendix S, paragraph II.A.4(iii)  or Sec. 52.21(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, as applicable), with  supporting documentation. In your calculation of the potential to emit  for an emissions unit, you must account for any proposed emission  limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For each modified emissions unit and replacement unit that is  listed, the allowable emissions of each regulated NSR pollutant in tpy  both before and after the modification (including fugitive emissions, to  the extent that they are quantifiable, if the emissions unit or source  belongs to one of the source categories listed in part 51, Appendix S,  paragraph II.A.4(iii) or Sec. 52.21(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, as  applicable), with supporting documentation. For emissions units that do  not have an allowable emissions limit prior to the modification, report  the potential to emit. In your calculation of annual allowable emissions  for an emissions unit after the modification, you must account for any  proposed emission limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The following information to the extent it is needed to  determine or regulate emissions: Fuels, fuel use, raw materials,  production rates and operating schedules.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Identification and description of any existing air pollution  control equipment and compliance monitoring devices or activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Any existing limitations on source operation affecting  emissions or any work practice standards, where applicable, for all NSR  regulated pollutants at the source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> For each emission point associated with an affected emissions  unit, provide stack or vent dimensions and flow information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional permit application content. At your option, you may  propose emission limitations for each affected emissions unit, which may  include pollution prevention techniques, air pollution control devices,  design standards, equipment standards, work practices, operational  standards or a combination thereof. You may include an explanation of  why you believe the proposed emission limitations to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section govern the completeness  review of your permit application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for a permit under this program will be reviewed  by the reviewing authority within 45 days of its receipt (60 days for  minor modifications at major sources) to determine whether the  application contains all the information necessary for processing the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the reviewing authority determines that the application is  not complete, it will request additional information from you as  necessary to process the application. If the reviewing authority  determines that the application is complete, it will notify you in  writing. The reviewing authority's completeness determination or request  for additional information should be postmarked within 45 days of  receipt of the permit application by the reviewing authority (60 days  for minor modifications at major sources). If you do not receive a  request for additional information or a notice of complete application  postmarked within 45 days of receipt of the permit application by the  reviewing authority (60 days for minor modifications at major sources),  your application will be deemed complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, while processing an application that has been determined to  be complete, the reviewing authority determines that additional  information is necessary to evaluate or take final action on the  application, it may request additional information from you and require  your responses within a reasonable time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any permit application will be granted or denied no later than  135 days (1 year for minor modifications at major sources) after the  date the application is deemed complete and all additional information  necessary to make an informed decision has been provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How will the reviewing authority determine the emission  limitations that will be required in my permit? After determining that  your application is complete, the reviewing authority will conduct a  case-by-case control technology review to determine the appropriate  level of control, if any, necessary to assure that NAAQS are achieved,  as well   as the corresponding emission limitations for the affected emissions  units at your source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In carrying out this case-by-case control technology review, the  reviewing authority will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Local air quality conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Typical control technology or other emissions reduction  measures used by similar sources in surrounding areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Anticipated economic growth in the area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cost-effective emission reduction alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reviewing authority must require a numerical limit on the  quantity, rate or concentration of emissions for each regulated NSR  pollutant emitted by each affected emissions unit at your source for  which such a limit is technically and economically feasible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The emission limitations required by the reviewing authority may  consist of numerical limits on the quantity, rate or concentration of  emissions; pollution prevention techniques; design standards; equipment  standards; work practices; operational standards; requirements relating  to the operation or maintenance of the source or any combination  thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The emission limitations required by the reviewing authority  must assure that each affected emissions unit will comply with all  requirements of parts 60, 61 and 63 of this chapter as well as any FIPs  or TIPs that apply to the unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The emission limitations required by the reviewing authority  must not be affected in a manner by so much of a stack's height as  exceeds good engineering practice or by any other dispersion technique,  except as provided in Sec. 51.118(b) of this chapter. If the reviewing  authority proposes to issue a permit to a source based on a good  engineering practice stack height that exceeds the height allowed by  Sec. 51.100(ii)(1) or (2) of this chapter, it must notify the public of  the availability of the demonstration study and must provide opportunity  for a public hearing according to the requirements of Sec. 49.157 for  the draft permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> through (3) of this section govern  AQIA requirements under this program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the reviewing authority has reason to be concerned that the  construction of your minor source or modification would cause or  contribute to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, it may require you to  conduct and submit an AQIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If required, you must conduct the AQIA using the dispersion  models and procedures of part 51, Appendix W of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the AQIA reveals that construction of your source or  modification would cause or contribute to a NAAQS or PSD increment  violation, the reviewing authority must require you to reduce or  mitigate such impacts before it can issue you a permit.</p>
