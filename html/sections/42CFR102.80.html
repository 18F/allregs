                            <p class="depth0">In calculating medical benefits, the Secretary will take into  consideration all reasonable costs for those medical items and services  that are reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat a smallpox  vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact's covered injury or its health  complications, as described in Sec.  102.31. The Secretary will consider  and may rely upon benefits documentation submitted by the requester  (e.g., bills, Explanation of Benefits, and cost-related documentation to  support the expenses relating to the covered injury or its health  complications), as required by Sec.  102.60. The Secretary will make  such payments only to the extent that such costs were not, and will not  be, paid by any third-party payor and only if no third-party payor had  or has an obligation to provide such services or items to the requester,  except as provided in Sec.  103.83(c) and Sec.  103.84. There are no  caps on medical benefits that may be provided under the Program.</p>
