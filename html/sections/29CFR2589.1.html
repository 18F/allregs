                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 8477(e)(1)(B) of FERSA, 5 U.S.C. 8477(e)(1)(B), permits  the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil penalty against a party in  interest who engages in a prohibited transaction with respect to the  Thrift Savings Fund. The initial penalty under section 8477(e)(1)(B) is  five percent of the ``amount involved'' in each such transaction for  each year or part thereof during which the prohibited transaction  continues. However, if the prohibited transaction is not corrected  during the ``correction period,'' the civil penalty may be in an amount  not more than 100% of the ``amount involved.'' The Department of Labor  will apply the definitions set out in Sec. 2560.502i-1(b) through (e) of  this chapter of title 29 (civil penalties under section 502(i) of ERISA)  in determining the ``amount involved,'' ``correction,'' ``correction  period,'' and for computation of the section 8477(e)(1)(B) penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The rules of practice set forth in Secs. 2570.1-2570.12 of part  2570, subpart A of subchapter G of this chapter of title 29 (procedures  for the assessment of civil sanctions under ERISA section 502(i)) are  applicable to prohibited transaction penalty proceedings under FERSA  section 8477(e)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER L_GROUP HEALTH PLANS</p>
