                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Protests concerning FAA SIRs, solicitations, or contract awards shall be resolved pursuant to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Potential protestors should, where possible, attempt to resolve any issues concerning potential protests with the CO. Such attempts are not a prerequisite to filing a protest with the ODRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offerors or prospective offerors shall file a protest with the ODRA in accordance with Sec. 17.15. The protest time limitations set forth in Sec. 17.15 will not be extended by attempts to resolve a potential protest with the CO. Other than the time limitations specified in Sec. 17.15 for the filing of protests, the ODRA retains the discretion to modify any timeframes established herein in connection with protests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with Sec. 17.17(b), the ODRA shall convene an initial status conference for the purpose of scheduling proceedings in the protest and to encourage the parties to consider using the ODRA's ADR process to attempt to resolve the protest, pursuant to subpart D of this part. It is the Agency's policy to use voluntary ADR to the maximum extent practicable. If the parties elect not to attempt ADR, or if ADR efforts do not completely resolve the protest, the protest will proceed under the ODRA Adjudicative Process set forth in subpart E of this part. Informal ADR techniques may be utilized simultaneously with ongoing adjudication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The ODRA Director shall designate DROs, outside neutrals or Special Masters as potential neutrals for the resolution of protests through ADR. The ultimate choice of an ADR neutral is made by the parties participating in the ADR. The ODRA Director also shall, at his or her sole discretion, designate an adjudicating DRO or Special Master for each matter. A person serving as a neutral in an ADR effort in a matter, shall not serve as an adjudicating DRO or Special Master for that matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiple protests concerning the same SIR, solicitation, or contract

award may be consolidated at the discretion of the ODRA Director, and assigned to a single DRO or Special Master for adjudication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procurement activities, and, where applicable, contractor performance pending resolution of a protest, shall continue during the pendency of a protest, unless there is a compelling reason to suspend all or part of the procurement activities or contractor performance. Pursuant to Sec. Sec. 17.15(d) and 17.17(a), the ODRA may impose a temporary suspension and recommend suspension of award or contract performance, in whole or in part, for a compelling reason. A decision to suspend procurement activities or contractor performance is made in writing by the Administrator or the Administrator's delegee upon recommendation of the ODRA.</p>
