                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Manner of payment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except for the insurance fees described  in the next sentence, all filing fees must be paid at the time the  application, petition, or other document is electronically filed. The  service fee for insurance, surety or self-insurer accepted certificate  of insurance, surety bond or other instrument submitted in lieu of a  broker surety bond must be charged to an insurance service account  established by FMCSA in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Billing account procedure. A request must be submitted to the  Office of Registration and Safety Information (MC-RS) at http:// www.fmcsa.dot.gov to establish an insurance service fee account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each account will have a specific billing date within each month  and a billing cycle. The billing date is the date that the bill is  prepared and printed. The billing cycle is the period between the  billing date in one month and the billing date in the next month. A bill  for each account that has activity or an unpaid balance during the  billing cycle will be sent on the billing date each month. Payment will  be due 20 days from the billing date. Payments received before the next  billing date are applied to the account. Interest will accrue in  accordance with 31 CFR 901.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal Claims Collection Standards, including disclosure  to consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as  set forth in 31 CFR part 901, will be utilized to encourage payment  where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An account holder who files a petition for bankruptcy or who  is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding must provide the following  information to the Office of Registration and Safety Information (MC-RS)  at http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The filing date of the bankruptcy petition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The type of bankruptcy proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of its representative in  the bankruptcy proceeding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the bankruptcy  trustee, if one has been appointed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fees will be payable through the U.S. Department of Treasury  secure payment system, Pay.gov, and are made directly from the payor's  bank account or by credit/debit card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any filing that is not accompanied by the appropriate filing fee  will be rejected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fees not refundable. Fees will be assessed for every filing  listed in the schedule of fees contained in paragraph (f) of this  section, titled, ``Schedule of filing fees,'' subject to the exceptions  contained in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the  application, petition, or other document has been accepted for filing by  FMCSA, the filing fee will not be refunded, regardless of whether the  application, petition, or other document is granted or approved, denied,  rejected before docketing, dismissed, or withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiple authorities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A separate filing fee is required for  each type of authority sought, for example broker authority requested by  an entity that already holds motor property carrier authority or  multiple types of authority requested in the same application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this  section, regardless of whether such applications are related to an  application for corresponding permanent operating authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Waiver or reduction of filing fees. It is the general policy of  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration not to waive or reduce  filing fees except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Filing fees are waived for an application that is filed by a  Federal government agency, or a State or local government entity. For  purposes of this section the phrases ``Federal government agency'' or  ``government entity'' do not include a quasi-governmental corporation or  government subsidized transportation company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filing fees are waived for a motor carrier of passengers that  receives a grant from the Federal Transit Administration either directly  or through a third-party contract to provide passenger transportation  under an agreement with a State or local government pursuant to 49  U.S.C. 5307, 5310, 5311, 5316, or 5317.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The FMCSA will consider other requests for waivers or fee  reductions only in extraordinary situations and in accordance with the  following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When to request. At the time that a filing is submitted to  FMCSA, the applicant may request a waiver or reduction of the fee  prescribed in this part. Such request should be addressed to the  Director, Office of Registration and Safety Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis. The applicant must show that the waiver or reduction of  the fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of the  fee would impose an undue hardship upon the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> FMCSA action. The Director, Office of Registration and Safety  Information, will notify the applicant of the decision to grant or deny  the request for waiver or reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Schedule of filing fees:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Type of proceeding                                       Fee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Part I: Registration</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.......................
