                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The master list must contain all the information on all the  EFS's filed   in the system, so arranged that it is possible to deliver to any  registrant all such information relating to any product, produced or  located in any county or parish (or all counties or parishes), for any  crop year, covered by the system. The system must be able to deliver all  such information to any registrant, either in alphabetical order by the  word appearing first in the name of each person subjecting a product to  a security interest (see Sec. 205.102), in numerical order by social  security number or approved unique identifier (or, if other than a  natural person, IRS taxpayer identification number or approved unique  identifier) of each such person, or in both alphabetical and numerical  orders, as requested by the registrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section (c)(2)(E) requires the portion to be distributed in  ``written or printed form.'' This means recording on paper by any  technology in a form that can be read by humans without special  equipment. The system may, however, honor requests from registrants to  substitute recordings on any medium by any technology including, but not  limited to, electronic recording on tapes or discs in machine-readable  form, and on photographic recording on microfiche. It also includes, if  requested by registrants, electronic transmissions whereby registrants  can print their own paper copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After distribution of a portion of a master list, there can be  supplementary distribution of a portion showing only changes from the  previous one. However, if this is done, cumulative supplements must be  distributed often enough that readers can find all the information given  to them for any one crop year in no more than three distributions.
