For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this  section, a representative of a Special Entity will be deemed to be  independent of the swap dealer or major swap participant if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The representative is not and, within one year of representing  the Special Entity in connection with the swap, was not an associated  person of   the swap dealer or major swap participant within the meaning of Section  1a(4) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is no principal relationship between the representative of  the Special Entity and the swap dealer or major swap participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The representative:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides timely and effective disclosures to the Special Entity  of all material conflicts of interest that could reasonably affect the  judgment or decision making of the representative with respect to its  obligations to the Special Entity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complies with policies and procedures reasonably designed to  manage and mitigate such material conflicts of interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The representative is not directly or indirectly, through one or  more persons, controlled by, in control of, or under common control with  the swap dealer or major swap participant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The swap dealer or major swap participant did not refer,  recommend, or introduce the representative to the Special Entity within  one year of the representative's representation of the Special Entity in  connection with the swap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safe harbor.

If a swap dealer or major swap  participant initially determines that it does not have a reasonable  basis to believe that the representative of a Special Entity meets the  criteria established in this section, the swap dealer or major swap  participant shall make a written record of the basis for such  determination and submit such determination to its chief compliance  officer for review to ensure that the swap dealer or major swap  participant has a substantial, unbiased basis for the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Before the initiation of a swap, a swap dealer or major swap  participant shall disclose to the Special Entity in writing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The capacity in which it is acting in connection with the swap;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the swap dealer or major swap participant engages in business  with the Special Entity in more than one capacity, the swap dealer or  major   swap participant shall disclose the material differences between such  capacities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> This section shall not apply with respect to a transaction that  is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initiated on a designated contract market or swap execution  facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One in which the swap dealer or major swap participant does not  know the identity of the counterparty to the transaction prior to  execution.</p>
