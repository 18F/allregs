                                Sec. 452.12  Organizations comprised of government employees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An organization composed entirely of government employees (other than employees of the United States Postal Service) is not subject to the election provisions of the Act. Section 3(e) of the Act, defining the term ``employer,'' specifically excludes the United States Government, its wholly owned corporations, and the States and their political subdivisions from the scope of that term, and section 3(f) defines an ``employee'' as an individual employed by an ``employer.'' Since a ``labor organization'' is defined in section 3(i) as one in which ``employees'' participate and which exists in whole or in part for the purpose of ``dealing with employers,'' an organization composed entirely of government employees would not be a ``labor organization'' \13\ as that term is defined in the Act. However, section 1209 of the Postal Reorganization Act provides that organizations of employees of the United States Postal Service shall be subject to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. A national, international or intermediate labor organization which has some locals of government employees not covered by the Act and other locals which are mixed or are composed entirely of employees covered by the Act would be subject to the election requirements of the Act. Its mixed locals

would also be subject to the Act. The requirements would not apply to locals composed entirely of government employees not covered by the Act, except with respect to the election of officers of a parent organization which is subject to those requirements or the election of delegates to a convention of such parent organization, or to an intermediate body to which the requirements apply.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\13\ Most labor organizations composed of Federal Government employees are subject to the standards of conduct provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 7120, or the Foreign Service Act, 22 U.S.C. 4117. The regulations implementing those statutory provisions are contained in parts 457-459 of this chapter.
