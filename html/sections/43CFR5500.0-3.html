Any authorized use of the surface of any such  mining claim shall be such as not to endanger or materially interfere  with prospecting, mining or processing operations or uses reasonably  incident thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the lands have been withdrawn in aid of a function of a  Federal department or agency other than the Department of the Interior,  or of a State, county, municipality, water district, or other local  governmental subdivision or agency, the Secretary of the Interior may  make disposals under the regulations in this subpart only with the  consent of such other Federal department or agency or of such State, or  local governmental unit. The Act of July 23, 1955, supra, provides,  however, that the Secretary of Agriculture shall dispose of materials  under the Act of July 31, 1947, as amended, supra, if such materials are  on lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture for national  forest purposes or for purposes of Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm  Tenant Act or where withdrawn for the purpose of any other function of  the Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of the Act of July 23, 1955, supra, in disposal  of vegetative or mineral materials do not apply to lands in any national  park, or national monument or to any Indian lands or lands set aside or  held for the use or benefit of Indians including lands over which  jurisdiction has been transferred to the Department of the Interior by  Executive order for the use of Indians.</p>
