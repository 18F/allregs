                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a PVO, you may take action to deny transportation or restrict  services to a passenger with a disability if necessitated by legitimate  safety requirements. Safety requirements must be based on actual risks  and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about  individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 to paragraph 39.27(a): You may take such action in order  to comply with Coast Guard safety regulations.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2 to paragraph 39.27(a): You may take such action if  accommodating a large or heavy wheelchair would, together with its  occupant, create weight and balance problem that could affect adversely  the seaworthiness of the vessel or impede emergency egress from the  vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3 to paragraph 39.27(a): You could restrict access to a  lifeboat for a mobility device that would limit access to the lifeboat  for other passengers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In taking action pursuant to legitimate safety requirements, you  must take the action that imposes the minimum feasible burdens or  limitations from the point of view of the passenger. For example, if you  can meet legitimate safety requirements by a means short of refusing  transportation to a passenger, you must do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may take action to deny transportation or restrict services  to a passenger if the passenger poses a direct threat to others. In  determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or  safety of others, the PVO must make an individualized assessment, based  on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on  the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: The nature,  duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential  injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of  policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.</p>
