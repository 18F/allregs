The  Board will initiate the requested offset only:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency  stating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the debtor owes the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount and basis of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of  administrative offset; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset  regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102,  including providing any required hearing or review; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon a determination by the Board that collection by offset  against funds payable by the Board would be in the best interest of the  United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the  particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary  to law.</p>
