                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must emit no organic HAP during each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in Sec. 63.4941.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative emission limit. You may request approval from the Administrator to use an alternative new source emission limit for specific metal furniture components or type of components for which you believe the emission limit in paragraph (a) of this section cannot be achieved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any request to use an alternative emission limit under paragraph (b) of this section must contain specific information demonstrating why no organic HAP-free coating technology can be used on the metal furniture components. The request must be based on objective criteria related to the performance or appearance requirements of the finished coating, which may include but is not limited to the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Low dried film thickness requirements (e.g., less than 0.0254 millimeters (0.001 inch)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flexibility requirements for parts subject to repeated bending.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Chemical resistance to withstand chemical exposure in environments such as laboratories.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Resistance to the effects of exposure to ultraviolet light.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Adhesion characteristics related to the condition of the substrate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> High gloss requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Custom colors such as matching the color of a corporate logo.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Non-uniform surface finishes such as an antique appearance that requires visible cracking of the dried film.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the request to use an alternative emission limit under paragraph (b) of this section is approved, the new source must meet an emission limit of 0.094 kilogram (kg) organic HAP per liter (kg/liter) (0.78 pounds per gallon (lb/gal)) coating solids used for only those components subject to the approval. All other metal furniture surface coating operations at the new source must meet the emission limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Until approval to use the alternative emission limit has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph (b)(2), you must meet the emission limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section and all other applicable requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 0.10 kg organic HAP per liter (0.83 lb/gal) of coating solids used during each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in Sec. 63.4941, Sec. 63.4951, or Sec. 63.4961.</p>
