                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory basis. This part implements the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812 (``the Act''). The Act provides SBA and other federal agencies with an administrative remedy to impose civil penalties and assessments against persons making false claims and statements. The Act also provides due process protections to all persons who are subject to administrative proceedings under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible remedies for program fraud. In addition to any other penalty which may be prescribed by law, a person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a false claim or a false statement to SBA is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each statement or claim, regardless of whether property, services, or money is actually delivered or paid by SBA. If SBA has made any payment, transferred property, or provided services in reliance on a false claim, the person submitting it is also subject to an assessment of not more than twice the amount of the false claim. This assessment is in lieu of damages sustained by SBA because of the false claim.</p>
