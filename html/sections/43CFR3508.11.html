                                Sec. 3508.11  What lands are available for competitive leasing?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">BLM may issue a competitive lease on unleased lands where we know that a valuable mineral deposit exists. In such areas, before issuing a lease we may issue you an exploration license, but not a prospecting permit. However, BLM may offer competitive leases for lands where no prospecting or exploratory work is needed to determine the existence or workability of a valuable mineral deposit. In addition, we may offer competitive leases for asphalt on any lands available for asphalt leasing, whether or not we know that a valuable mineral deposit exists.</p>
