Any person who wishes to know whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to him may appear in person at the National Endowment for the Arts, Room 1338, 2401 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20506 or the National Endowment for the Humanities, Room 1000, 806 15th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506, on work days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. or by writing to the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506. It is recommended that requests be made in writing, since in many cases it will take several days to ascertain whether a record exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for notification of the existence of a record should specifically identify the system of records involved and should state, if the requestor is other than the individual to whom the record pertains, the relationship of the requestor to that individual. (Note that requests will not be honored by the Foundation pursuant to the Privacy Act unless made (1) by the individual to whom the record pertains, (2) by such individual's parent if the individual is a minor, or (3) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Foundation will attempt to respond to a request as to whether a record exists within 10 working days from the time it receives the request or from the time any required identification is established, whichever is later.</p>
