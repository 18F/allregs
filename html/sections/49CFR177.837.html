                            <p class="depth0">(See also Sec. 177.834 (a) to (j).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engine stopped. Unless the engine of a cargo tank motor vehicle  is to be used for the operation of a pump, Class 3 material may not be  loaded into, or on, or unloaded from any cargo tank motor vehicle while  the engine is running. The diesel engine of a cargo tank motor vehicle  may be left running during the loading and unloading of a Class 3  material if the ambient atmospheric temperature is at or below -12 C  (10 F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bonding and grounding containers other than cargo tanks prior to  and during transfer of lading. For containers which are not in metallic  contact with each other, either metallic bonds or ground conductors  shall be provided for the neutralization of possible static charges  prior to and during transfers of Class 3 (flammable liquid) materials  between such containers. Such bonding shall be made by first connecting  an electric conductor to the container to be filled and subsequently  connecting the conductor to the container from which the liquid is to  come, and not in any other order. To provide against ignition of vapors  by discharge of static electricity, the latter connection shall be made  at a point well removed from the opening from which the Class 3  (flammable liquid) material is to be discharged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bonding and grounding cargo tanks before and during transfer of  lading. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a cargo tank is loaded through an open filling hole,  one end of a bond   wire shall be connected to the stationary system piping or integrally  connected steel framing, and the other end to the shell of the cargo  tank to provide a continuous electrical connection. (If bonding is to  the framing, it is essential that piping and framing be electrically  interconnected.) This connection must be made before any filling hole is  opened, and must remain in place until after the last filling hole has  been closed. Additional bond wires are not needed around All-Metal  flexible or swivel joints, but are required for nonmetallic flexible  connections in the stationary system piping. When a cargo tank is  unloaded by a suction-piping system through an open filling hole of the  cargo tank, electrical continuity shall be maintained from cargo tank to  receiving tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a cargo tank is loaded or unloaded through a vapor-tight  (not open hole) top or bottom connection, so that there is no release of  vapor at a point where a spark could occur, bonding or grounding is not  required. Contact of the closed connection must be made before flow  starts and must not be broken until after the flow is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bonding or grounding is not required when a cargo tank is  unloaded through a nonvapor-tight connection into a stationary tank  provided the metallic filling connection is maintained in contact with  the filling hole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unloading combustible liquids. For a cargo tank unloading a  material meeting the definition for combustible liquid in  Sec. 173.150(f) of this subchapter, the qualified person attending the  unloading operation must remain within 45.72 meters (150 feet) of the  cargo tank and 7.62 meters (25 feet) of the delivery hose and must  observe both the cargo tank and the receiving container at least once  every five minutes during unloading operations that take more than five  minutes to complete.
