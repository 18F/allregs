                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The board of directors of Farmer Mac must provide effective  oversight (direction, controls, and supervision) of interest rate risk  management and must be knowledgeable of the nature and level of interest  rate risk taken by Farmer Mac.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The board of directors of Farmer Mac must adopt an interest rate  risk management policy that establishes appropriate interest rate risk  exposure limits based on the Corporation's risk-bearing capacity and  reporting requirements in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section. At least annually, the board of directors, or a designated  committee of the board, must review the policy. Any changes to the  policy must be approved by the board of directors. You must report any  changes to the policy to the OSMO within 10 business days of adoption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The interest rate risk management policy must, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Address the purpose and objectives of interest rate risk  management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the causes of interest rate risk and set appropriate  quantitative limits consistent with a clearly articulated board risk  tolerance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require management to establish and implement comprehensive  procedures to measure the potential effect of these risks on the  Corporation's projected earnings and market values by conducting  interest rate stress tests and simulations of multiple economic  scenarios at least quarterly. Your stress tests must gauge how interest  rate fluctuations affect the Corporation's capital, earnings, and  liquidity position. The methodology that you use must be appropriate for  the complexity of the structure and cash flows of your on- and off- balance sheet positions, including the nature and purpose of derivative  contracts, and establish counterparty risk thresholds and limits for  derivatives. It must also ensure an appropriate level of consistency  with the stress-test scenarios considered under Sec. 652.10(f)(4).  Assumptions applied in stress tests must, to the maximum extent  practicable, rely on verifiable information. You must document the basis  for all assumptions that you use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe and authorize management to implement actions needed to  achieve Farmer Mac's desired risk management objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ensure procedures are established to evaluate and document, at  least quarterly, whether actions taken have actually met the  Corporation's desired risk management objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identify exception parameters and approvals needed for any  exceptions to the policy's requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Describe delegations of authority; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Describe reporting requirements, including exceptions to policy  limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At least quarterly, management must report to the Corporation's  board of directors, or a designated committee of the board, describing  the nature and level of interest rate risk exposure. Any deviations from  the board's policy on interest rate risk must be specifically identified  in the report and approved by the board, or a designated committee of  the board.</p>
