                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 183 provides rules relating to the allowance  of deductions in the case of activities (whether active or passive in  character) not engaged in for profit by individuals and electing small  business corporations, creates a presumption that an activity is engaged  in for profit if certain requirements are met, and permits the taxpayer  to elect to postpone determination of whether such presumption applies  until he has engaged in the activity for at least 5 taxable years, or,  in certain cases, 7 taxable years. Whether an activity is engaged in for  profit is determined under section 162 and section 212 (1) and (2)  except insofar as section 183(d) creates a presumption that the activity  is engaged in for profit. If deductions are not allowable under sections  162 and 212 (1) and (2), the deduction allowance rules of section 183(b)  and this section apply. Pursuant to section 641(b), the taxable income  of an estate or trust is computed in the same manner as in the case of  an individual, with certain exceptions not here relevant. Accordingly,  where an estate or trust engages in an activity or activities which are  not for profit, the rules of section 183 and this section apply in  computing the allowable deductions of such trust or estate. No inference  is to be drawn from the provisions of section 183 and the regulations  thereunder that any activity of a corporation (other than an electing  small business corporation) is or is not a business or engaged in for  profit. For rules relating to the deductions that may be taken into  account by taxable membership organizations which are operated primarily  to furnish services, facilities, or goods to members, see section 277  and the regulations thereunder. For the definition of an activity not  engaged in for profit, see Sec. 1.183-2. For rules relating to the  election contained in section 183(e), see Sec. 1.183-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductions allowable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manner and extent. If an activity is  not engaged in for profit, deductions are allowable under section 183(b)  in the following order and only to the following extent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts allowable as deductions during the taxable year under  Chapter 1 of the Code without regard to whether the activity giving rise  to such amounts was engaged in for profit are allowable to the full  extent allowed by the relevant sections of the Code, determined after  taking into account any limitations or exceptions with respect to the  allowability of such amounts. For example, the allowability-of-interest  expenses incurred with respect to activities not engaged in for profit  is limited by the rules contained in section 163(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions during the taxable  year under Chapter 1 of the Code, but only if such allowance does not  result in an adjustment to the basis of property, determined as if the  activity giving rise to such amounts was engaged in for profit, are  allowed only to the extent the gross income attributable to such  activity exceeds the deductions allowed or allowable under subdivision  (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions for the taxable year  under Chapter 1 of the Code which result in (or if otherwise allowed  would have resulted in) an adjustment to the basis of property,  determined as if the activity giving rise to such deductions was engaged  in for profit, are allowed only to the extent the gross income  attributable to such activity exceeds the deductions allowed or  allowable under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.  Deductions falling within this subdivision include such items as  depreciation, partial losses with respect to property, partially  worthless debts, amortization, and amortizable bond premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rule for deductions involving basis adjustments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  If deductions are allowed under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph,  and such deductions are allowed with respect to more than one asset, the  deduction allowed with respect to each asset shall be determined  separately in accordance with the computation set forth in subdivision  (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis adjustment fraction. The deduction allowed under  subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph is computed by multiplying the  amount which would have been allowed, had the activity   been engaged in for profit, as a deduction with respect to each  particular asset which involves a basis adjustment, by the basis  adjustment fraction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The numerator of which is the total of deductions allowable  under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The denominator of which is the total of deductions which  involve basis adjustments which would have been allowed with respect to  the activity had the activity been engaged in for profit.  The amount resulting from this computation is the deduction allowed  under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph with respect to the  particular asset. The basis of such asset is adjusted only to the extent  of such deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, an individual, maintains a herd of dairy cattle, which  is an ``activity not engaged in for profit'' within the meaning of  section 183(c). A sold milk for $1,000 during the year. During the year  A paid $300 State taxes on gasoline used to transport the cows, milk,  etc., and paid $1,200 for feed for the cows. For the year A also had a  casualty loss attributable to this activity of $500. A determines the  amount of his allowable deductions under section 183 as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph as follows:  State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section             $300</p><p class="depth0">164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged</p><p class="depth0">in for profit...............................................

In view of these circumstances, it is not necessary to determine  deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph which  would be allowable under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were  engaged in for profit and which involve basis adjustment (the $100 of  casualty loss not allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph  because of the limitation in section 165(c)(3)) because none of such  amount will be allowed as a deduction under section 183.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A also  had income from sales of hay grown on the farm of $1,200 and that  depreciation of $750 with respect to a barn, and $650 with respect to a  tractor would have been allowed with respect to the activity had it been  engaged in for profit. A determines the amount of his allowable  deductions under section 183 as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph as follows:  State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section             $300</p><p class="depth0">164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged</p><p class="depth0">in for profit...............................................

For purposes  of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the gross income from any  activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of all capital  gains attributable to such activity determined without regard to the  section 1202 deduction. Amounts attributable to an activity not engaged  in for profit which would be allowable as a deduction under section  1202, without regard to section 183, shall be allowable as a deduction  under section 183(b)(1) in accordance with the rules stated in this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cases where deduction not allowed under section 183.

If for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any 2 of 7 consecutive taxable years, in the case of an activity  which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or  racing of horses, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any 2 of 5 consecutive taxable years, in the case of any other  activity, the gross income derived from an activity exceeds the  deductions attributable to such activity which would be allowed or  allowable if the activity were engaged in for profit, such activity is  presumed, unless the Commissioner establishes to the contrary, to be  engaged in for profit. For purposes of this determination the deduction  permitted by section 1202 shall not be taken into account. Such  presumption applies with respect to the second profit year and all years  subsequent to the second profit year within the 5- or 7-year period  beginning with the first profit year. This presumption arises only if  the activity is substantially the same activity for each of the relevant  taxable years, including the taxable year in question. If the taxpayer  does not meet the requirements of section 183(d) and this paragraph, no  inference that the activity is not engaged in for profit shall arise by  reason of the provisions of section 183. For purposes of this paragraph,  a net operating loss deduction is not taken into account as a deduction.  For purposes of this subparagraph a short taxable year constitutes a  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is  assumed that the taxpayer has not elected, in accordance with section  183(e), to postpone determination of whether the presumption described  in section 183(d) and this paragraph is applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For taxable years 1970-74, A, an individual who uses the  cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the calendar  year as the taxable year, is engaged in the activity of farming. In  taxable years 1971, 1973, and 1974, A's deductible expenditures with  respect to such activity exceed his gross income from the activity. In  taxable years 1970 and 1972 A has income from the sale of farm produce  of $30,000 for each year. In each of such years A had expenses for feed  for his livestock of $10,000, depreciation of equipment of $10,000, and  fertilizer   cost of $5,000 which he elects to take as a deduction. A also has a net  operating loss carryover to taxable year 1970 of $6,000. A is presumed,  for taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974, to have engaged in the activity  of farming for profit, since for 2 years of a 5-consecutive-year period  the gross income from the activity ($30,000 for each year) exceeded the  deductions (computed without regard to the net operating loss) which are  allowable in the case of the activity ($25,000 for each year).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For the taxable years 1970 and 1971, B, an individual who  uses the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the  calendar year as taxable year, engaged in raising pure-bred Charolais  cattle for breeding purposes. The operation showed a loss during 1970.  At the end of 1971, B sold a substantial portion of his herd and the  cattle operation showed a profit for that year. For all subsequent  relevant taxable years B continued to keep a few Charolais bulls at  stud. In 1972, B started to raise Tennessee Walking Horses for breeding  and show purposes, utilizing substantially the same pasture land, barns,  and (with structural modifications) the same stalls. The Walking Horse  operations showed a small profit in 1973 and losses in 1972 and 1974  through 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assuming that under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the raising  of cattle and raising of horses are determined to be separate  activities, no presumption that the Walking Horse operation was carried  on for profit arises under section 183(d) and this paragraph since this  activity was not the same activity that generated the profit in 1971 and  there are not, therefore, 2 profit years attributable to the horse  activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assuming the same facts as in (i) above, if there were no stud  fees received in 1972 with respect to Charolais bulls, but for 1973 stud  fees with respect to such bulls exceed deductions attributable to  maintenance of the bulls in that year, the presumption will arise under  section 183(d) and this paragraph with respect to the activity of  raising and maintaining Charolais cattle for 1973 and for all subsequent  years within the 5-year period beginning with taxable year 1971, since  the activity of raising and maintaining Charolais cattle is the same  activity in 1971 and in 1973, although carried on by B on a much reduced  basis and in a different manner. Since it has been assumed that the  horse and cattle operations are separate activities, no presumption will  arise with respect to the Walking Horse operation because there are not  2 profit years attributable to such horse operation during the period in  question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assuming, alternatively, that the raising of cattle and  raising of horses would be considered a single activity under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, B would receive the benefit of the presumption  beginning in 1973 with respect to both the cattle and horses since there  were profits in 1971 and 1973. The presumption would be effective  through 1977 (and longer if there is an excess of income over deductions  in this activity in 1974, 1975, 1976, or 1977 which would extend the  presumption) if, under section 183(d) and subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, it was determined that the activity consists in major part of  the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses. Otherwise, the  presumption would be effective only through 1975 (assuming no excess of  income over deductions in this activity in 1974 or 1975 which would  extend the presumption).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training,  showing, or racing of horses. For purposes of this paragraph an activity  consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of  horses for the taxable year if the average of the portion of  expenditures attributable to breeding, training, showing, and racing of  horses for the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year (or, in the  case of an activity which has not been conducted by the taxpayer for 3  years, for so long as it has been carried on by him) was at least 50  percent of the total expenditures attributable to the activity for such  prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transitional rule. In applying the presumption described in  section 183(d) and this paragraph, only taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1969, shall be taken into account. Accordingly, in the case  of an activity referred to in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this  paragraph, section 183(d) does not apply prior to the second profitable  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, since taxable years  prior to such date are not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cross reference. For rules relating to section 183(e) which  permits a taxpayer to elect to postpone determination of whether any  activity shall be presumed to be ``an activity engaged in for profit''  by operation of the presumption described in section 183(d) and this  paragraph until after the close of the fourth taxable year (sixth  taxable year, in the case of activity which consists in major part of  breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses) following the taxable  year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, see Sec.  1.183-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Activity defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ascertainment of activity. In order to  determine whether, and to what extent, section 183 and the regulations  thereunder apply, the activity or activities of the taxpayer must be  ascertained. For instance, where the taxpayer is engaged in several  undertakings, each of these may be a separate activity, or several  undertakings may constitute one activity. In ascertaining the activity  or activities of the taxpayer, all the facts and circumstances of the  case must be taken into account. Generally, the most significant facts  and circumstances in making this determination are the degree of  organizational and economic interrelationship of various undertakings,  the business purpose which is (or might be) served by carrying on the  various undertakings separately or together in a trade or business or in  an investment setting, and the similarity of various undertakings.  Generally, the Commissioner will accept the characterization by the  taxpayer of several undertakings either as a single activity or as  separate activities. The taxpayer's characterization will not be  accepted, however, when it appears that his characterization is  artificial and cannot be reasonably supported under the facts and  circumstances of the case. If the taxpayer engages in two or more  separate activities, deductions and income from each separate activity  are not aggregated either in determining whether a particular activity  is engaged in for profit or in applying section 183. Where land is  purchased or held primarily with the intent to profit from increase in  its value, and the taxpayer also engages in farming on such land, the  farming and the holding of the land will ordinarily be considered a  single activity only if the farming activity reduces the net cost of  carrying the land for its appreciation in value. Thus, the farming and  holding of the land will be considered a single activity only if the  income derived from farming exceeds the deductions attributable to the  farming activity which are not directly attributable to the holding of  the land (that is, deductions other than those directly attributable to  the holding of the land such as interest on a mortgage secured by the  land, annual property taxes attributable to the land and improvements,  and depreciation of improvements to the land).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for allocation of expenses. If the taxpayer is engaged in  more than one activity, an item of deduction or income may be allocated  between two or more of these activities. Where property is used in  several activities, and one or more of such activities is determined not  to be engaged in for profit, deductions relating to such property must  be allocated between the various activities on a reasonable and  consistently applied basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, owns a small house located near the  beach in a resort community. Visitors come to the area for recreational  purposes during only 3 months of the year. During the remaining 9 months  of the year houses such as A's are not rented. Customarily, A arranges  that the house will be leased for 2 months of 3-month recreational  season to vacationers and reserves the house for his own vacation during  the remaining month of the recreational season. In 1971, A leases the  house for 2 months for $1,000 per month and actually uses the house for  his own vacation during the other month of the recreational season. For  1971, the expenses attributable to the house are $1,200 interest, $600  real estate taxes, $600 maintenance, $300 utilities, and $1,200 which  would have been allowed as depreciation had the activity been engaged in  for profit. Under these facts and circumstances, A is engaged in a  single activity, holding the beach house primarily for personal  purposes, which is an ``activity not engaged in for profit'' within the  meaning of section 183(c). See paragraph (b)(9) of Sec. 1.183-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Since the $1,200 of interest and the $600 of real estate taxes  are specifically allowable as deductions under sections 163 and 164(a)  without regard to whether the beach house activity is engaged in for  profit, no allocation of these expenses between the uses of the beach  house is necessary. However, since section 262 specifically disallows  personal, living, and family expenses as deductions, the maintenance and  utilities expenses and the depreciation from the activity must be  allocated between the rental use and the personal use of the beach  house. Under the particular facts and circumstances, \2/3\ (2 months of  rental use over 3 months of total use) of each of these expenses are  allocated to the rental use, and \1/3\ (1 month of personal use over 3  months of total use) of each of these expenses are allocated to the  personal use as follows:     ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Rental use 2/ Personal use</p><p class="depth0">3-- expenses      1/3--</p><p class="depth0">allocable to    expenses</p><p class="depth0">section    allocable to</p><p class="depth0">183(b)(2)    section 262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Maintenance expense $600....................          $400          $200 Utilities expense $300......................           200           100 Depreciation $1,200.........................           800           400</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total...................................         1,400           700 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   The $700 of expenses and depreciation allocated to the personal use of  the beach house are disallowed as a deduction under section 262. In  addition, the allowability of each of the expenses and the depreciation  allocated to section 183(b)(2) is determined under paragraph (b)(1) (ii)  and (iii) of this section. Thus, the maximum amount allowable as a  deduction under section 183(b)(2) is $200 ($2,000 gross income from  activity, less $1,800 deductions under section 183(b)(1)). Since the  amounts described in section 183(b)(2) ($1,400) exceed the maximum  amount allowable ($200), and since the amounts described in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section ($600) exceed such maximum amount allowable  ($200), none of the depreciation (an amount described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section) is allowable as a deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Gross income from activity not engaged in for profit defined.  For purposes of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, gross income  derived from an activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of  all gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, and  all other gross receipts derived from such activity. Such gross income  shall include, for instance, capital gains, and rents received for the  use of property which is held in connection with the activity. The  taxpayer may determine gross income from any activity by subtracting the  cost of goods sold from the gross receipts so long as he consistently  does so and follows generally accepted methods of accounting in  determining such gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rule for electing small business corporations. Section 183 and  this section shall be applied at the corporate level in determining the  allowable deductions of an electing small business corporation.  [T.D. 7198, 37 FR 13680, July 13, 1972]</p>
