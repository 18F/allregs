Parties may submit subsequent final offers following such  negotiations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To provide an opportunity for final post-offer negotiations, the  arbitrator will not issue a decision for at least fifteen days after  submission to the arbitrator of the final offers by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final offers submitted by the parties to the arbitrator shall be  consistent with section 251 of the Act, including the rules prescribed  by the Commission pursuant to that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each final offer shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the requirements of section 251, including the rules  prescribed by the Commission pursuant to that section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish rates for interconnection, services, or access to  unbundled network elements according to section 252(d) of the Act,  including the rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to that  section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and  conditions by the parties to the agreement. If a final offer submitted  by one or more parties fails to comply with the requirements of this  section or if the arbitrator determines in unique circumstances that  another result would better implement the Communications Act, the  arbitrator has discretion to take steps designed to result in an  arbitrated agreement that satisfies the requirements of section 252(c)  of the Act, including requiring parties to submit new final offers  within a time frame specified by the arbitrator, or adopting a result  not submitted by any party that is consistent with the requirements of  section 252(c) of the Act, and the rules prescribed by the Commission  pursuant to that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Participation in the arbitration proceeding will be limited to  the requesting telecommunications carrier and the incumbent LEC, except  that the Commission will consider requests by third parties to file  written pleadings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Absent mutual consent of the parties to change any terms and  conditions adopted by the arbitrator, the decision of the arbitrator  shall be binding on the parties.
