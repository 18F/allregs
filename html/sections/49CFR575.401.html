                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to aid potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger cars and light trucks by providing them with information about vehicles' performance in terms of fuel economy, greenhouse gas (GHG), and other air pollutant emissions. Manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks are required to include this information on the label described in this section. Although this information will also be available through means such as postings at http://www.fueleconomy.gov, the additional label information is intended to provide consumers with this information at the point of sale, and to help them compare between vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application. This section applies to passenger cars and light trucks manufactured in model year 2013 and later. Manufacturers may optionally comply with this section during model year 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data element means a piece of information required or permitted to be included on the fuel economy and environment label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuel economy and environment label means the label with information about automobile performance in terms of fuel economy, greenhouse gases, and other emissions and with rating systems for fuel economy, greenhouse gases, and other emissions that also indicate the automobile(s) with the highest fuel economy and lowest greenhouse gas emissions, as specified at 49 U.S.C. 32908(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Miles per gasoline gallon equivalent (MPGe) is a measure of distance traveled per unit of energy consumed, and functions as a recognizable equivalent to, e.g., kilowatt-hours per mile (kW-hr/mile).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Monroney label means the label placed on new automobiles with the manufacturer's suggested retail price and other consumer information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233 (also known as the ``Automobile Information Disclosure Act label'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other air pollutants or other emissions means those tailpipe emissions, other than carbon dioxide (CO2), for which manufacturers must provide EPA with emissions rates for all new light duty vehicles each model year under EPA's Tier 2 light duty vehicle emissions standards requirements (40 CFR Part 86, Subpart S) or the parallel requirements for those vehicles certified instead to the California emissions standards. These air pollutants include non-methane organic gases (NMOG), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (HCHO).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Slider bar means a horizontal rating scale with a minimum value at one end and a maximum value at the other end that can accommodate a designation of a specific value between those values with a box or arrow. The actual rating value would be printed (displayed) at the proper position on the scale representing the vehicle's actual rating value relative to the two end values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Required label. Prior to being offered for sale, each manufacturer must affix or cause to be affixed and each dealer must maintain or cause to be maintained on each passenger car or light truck a label that meets the requirements specified in this section, and conforms in content, format, and sequence to the sample labels depicted in the appendix to this section. The manufacturer must have the fuel economy label affixed in such a manner that appearance and legibility are maintained until after the vehicle is delivered to the ultimate consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Required label information and format--general provisions--(1) Location. It is preferable that the fuel economy and environment label information be incorporated into the Monroney label, provided that the prominence and legibility of the fuel economy and environment label is maintained. If the fuel economy and environment label is incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be placed on a separate section in the Monroney label and must not be intermixed with that label information, except for vehicle descriptions as noted in 40 CFR 600.302-08(d)(1). If the fuel economy and environment label is not incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be located on a side window, and as close as possible to the

Monroney label. If the window is not large enough to accommodate both the Monroney label and the fuel economy and environment label, the latter must be located on another window as close as physically possible to the Monroney label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Location. It is preferable that the fuel economy and environment label information be incorporated into the Monroney label, provided that the prominence and legibility of the fuel economy and environment label is maintained. If the fuel economy and environment label is incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be placed on a separate section in the Monroney label and must not be intermixed with that label information, except for vehicle descriptions as noted in 40 CFR 600.302-08(d)(1). If the fuel economy and environment label is not incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be located on a side window, and as close as possible to the

Monroney label. If the window is not large enough to accommodate both the Monroney label and the fuel economy and environment label, the latter must be located on another window as close as physically possible to the Monroney label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Size and legibility. The fuel economy and environment label must be readily visible from the exterior of the vehicle and presented in a legible and prominent fashion. The label must be rectangular in shape with a minimum height of 4.5 inches (114 mm) and a minimum length of 7.0 inches (177 mm) as specified in the appendix to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basic appearance. Fuel economy and environment labels must be printed on white or very light paper with the color specified in this section; any label markings for which a color is not specified here must be in black and white. The label can be divided into three separate fields outlined by a continuous border, as described in the appendix to this section. Manufacturers must make a good faith effort to conform to the formats illustrated in the appendix to this section. Label templates are available for download at http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy/.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Border.
