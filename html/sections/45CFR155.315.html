The date on which the notice is received means 5 days after the date on the notice, unless the individual demonstrates that he or she did not receive the notice within the 5 day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Verification of citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence--(1) Verification with records from the Social Security Administration.

For an applicant who has documentation that can be verified through the Department of Homeland Security and who attests to lawful presence, or who attests to citizenship and for whom the Exchange cannot substantiate a claim of citizenship through the Social Security Administration, the Exchange must transmit information from the applicant's documentation and other identifying information to HHS, which will submit necessary information to the Department of Homeland Security for verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inconsistencies and inability to verify information. For an applicant who attests to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence, and for

whom the Exchange cannot verify such attestation through the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland Security, the Exchange must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, except that the Exchange must provide the applicant with a period of 90 days from the date on which the notice described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is received for the applicant to provide satisfactory documentary evidence or resolve the inconsistency with the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland Security, as applicable. The date on which the notice is received means 5 days after the date on the notice, unless the applicant demonstrates that he or she did not receive the notice within the 5 day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Verification of residency.

Evidence of immigration status may not be used to determine that an applicant is not a resident of the Exchange service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Verification of incarceration status. The Exchange must verify an applicant's attestation that he or she meets the requirements of Sec. 155.305(a)(2) by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Relying on any electronic data sources that are available to the Exchange and which have been approved by HHS for this purpose, based on evidence showing that such data sources are sufficiently current, accurate, and offer less administrative complexity than paper verification; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if an approved data source is unavailable, accepting his or her attestation without further verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that an applicant's attestation is not reasonably compatible with information from approved data sources described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or other information provided by the applicant or in the records of the Exchange, the Exchange must follow the procedures specified in Sec. 155.315(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Inconsistencies.

For an applicant who does not have documentation with which to resolve the inconsistency through the process described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section because such documentation does not exist or is not reasonably available and for whom the Exchange is unable to otherwise resolve the inconsistency, with the exception of an inconsistency related to citizenship or immigration status, the Exchange must provide an exception, on a case-by-case basis, to accept an applicant's attestation as to the information which cannot otherwise be verified along with an explanation of circumstances as to why the applicant does not have documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Flexibility in information collection and verification. HHS may approve an Exchange Blueprint in accordance with Sec. 155.105(d) or a significant change to the Exchange Blueprint in accordance with Sec. 155.105(e) to modify the methods to be used for collection of information and verification of information as set forth in this subpart, as well as the specific information required to be collected, provided that HHS finds that such modification would reduce the administrative costs and burdens on individuals while maintaining accuracy and minimizing delay, that it would not undermine coordination with Medicaid and CHIP, and that applicable requirements under Sec. Sec. 155.260, 155.270, paragraph (i) of this section, and section 6103 of the Code with respect to the confidentiality, disclosure, maintenance, or use of such information will be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicant information. The Exchange must not require an applicant to provide information beyond the minimum necessary to support the eligibility and enrollment processes of the Exchange, Medicaid, CHIP, and the BHP, if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Verification related to eligibility for enrollment through the Exchange in a QHP that is a catastrophic plan. The Exchange must verify an applicant's attestation that he or she meets the requirements of Sec. 155.305(h) by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Verifying the applicant's attestation of age as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, accepting his

or her attestation without further verification; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examining electronic data sources that are available to the Exchange and which have been approved by HHS for this purpose, based on evidence showing that such data sources are sufficiently current and accurate, and minimize administrative costs and burdens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If information regarding age is not reasonably compatible with other information provided by the individual or in the records of the Exchange, the Exchange must examine information in data sources that are available to the Exchange and which have been approved by HHS for this purpose based on evidence showing that such data sources are sufficiently current and accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Verifying that an applicant has a certification of exemption in effect as described in Sec. 155.305(h)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that the Exchange is unable to verify the information required to determine eligibility for enrollment through the Exchange in a QHP that is a catastrophic plan as described in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section, the Exchange must follow the procedures specified in Sec. 155.315(f), except for Sec. 155.315(f)(4).
