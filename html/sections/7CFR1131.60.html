Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under Sec. 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(c) by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1000.44(b) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant

to Sec. 1000.43(d) and Sec. 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1000.43(d).
