A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing with justification to the cognizant District Commander. The cognizant District Commander may require the OCS facility owner or operator to provide additional data for use in determining the validity of the requested waiver. The cognizant District Commander may grant a waiver, in writing, with or without conditions only if the waiver will not reduce the overall security of the OCS facility, its personnel, or visiting vessels.</p>
