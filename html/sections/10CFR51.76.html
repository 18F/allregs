                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The NRC will prepare a draft environmental impact statement relating to issuance of a limited work authorization in accordance with the procedures and measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, and 51.73, as further supplemented or modified in the following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limited work authorization submitted as part of complete construction permit or combined license application. If the application for a limited work authorization is submitted as part of a complete construction permit or combined license application, then the NRC may prepare a partial draft environmental impact statement. The analysis called for by Sec. 51.71(d) must be limited to the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization. Alternatively, the NRC may prepare a complete draft environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phased application for limited work authorization under Sec. 2.101(a)(9) of this chapter. If the application for a limited work authorization is submitted in accordance with Sec. 2.101(a)(9) of this chapter, then the draft environmental impact statement for part one of the application may be limited to consideration of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization, and the proposed redress plan. However, if the environmental report contains the full set of information required to be submitted under Sec. 51.50(a) or (c), then a draft environmental impact statement must be prepared in accordance with Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable. Siting issues, including whether there is an obviously superior alternative site, or issues related to operation of the proposed nuclear power plant at the site, including need for power, may not be considered. After part two of the application is docketed, the NRC will prepare a draft supplement to the final environmental impact statement for part two of the application under Sec. 51.72. No updating of the information contained in the final environmental impact statement prepared for part one is necessary in preparation of the supplemental environmental impact statement. The draft supplement must consider all environmental impacts associated with the prior issuance of the limited work authorization, but may not address or consider the sunk costs associated with the limited work authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited work authorization submitted as part of an early site permit application. If the application for a limited work authorization is submitted as part of an application for an early site permit, then the NRC will prepare

an environmental impact statement in accordance with Sec. 51.75(b). However, the analysis called for by Sec. 51.71(d) must also address the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited work authorization request submitted by an early site permit holder. If the application for a limited work authorization is submitted by a holder of an early site permit, then the NRC will prepare a draft supplement to the environmental impact statement for the early site permit. The supplement is limited to consideration of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization, the adequacy of the proposed redress plan, and whether there is new and significant information identified with respect to issues related to the impacts of construction of the facility that were resolved in the early site permit proceeding with respect to the environmental impacts of the activities to be conducted under the limited work authorization. No other updating of the information contained in the final environmental impact statement prepared for the early site permit is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limited work authorization for a site where an environmental impact statement was prepared, but the facility construction was not completed. If the limited work authorization is for activities to be conducted at a site for which the Commission has previously prepared an environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, and a construction permit was issued but construction of the plant was not completed, then the draft environmental impact statement shall incorporate by reference the earlier environmental impact statement. The draft environmental impact statement must be limited to a consideration of whether there is significant new information with respect to the environmental impacts of construction, relevant to the activities to be conducted under the limited work authority, so that the conclusion of the referenced environmental impact statement on the impacts of construction would, when analyzed in accordance with Sec. 51.71, lead to the conclusion that the limited work authorization should not be issued or should be issued with appropriate conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Draft environmental impact statement. A draft environmental impact statement prepared under this section must separately evaluate the environmental impacts and proposed alternatives attributable to the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization. However, if the ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization Stage,'' also contains the information required to be submitted in the environmental report required under Sec. 51.50, then the environmental impact statement must address the impacts of construction and operation for the proposed facility (including the environmental impacts attributable to the limited work authorization), and discuss the overall costs and benefits balancing for the underlying proposed action, in accordance with Sec. 51.71, and Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable.
