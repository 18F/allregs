                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxpayer identifying numbers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Principal  types. There are several types of taxpayer identifying numbers that  include the following: social security numbers, Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) individual taxpayer identification numbers, IRS adoption taxpayer  identification numbers, and employer identification numbers. Social  security numbers take the form 000-00-0000. IRS individual taxpayer  identification numbers and IRS adoption taxpayer identification numbers  also take the form 000-00-0000 but include a specific number or numbers  designated by the IRS. Employer identification numbers take the form 00- 0000000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Uses. Social security numbers, IRS individual taxpayer  identification numbers, and IRS adoption taxpayer identification numbers  are used to identify individual persons. Employer identification numbers  are used to identify employers. For the definition of social security  number and employer identification number, see Sec. Sec. 301.7701-11  and 301.7701-12, respectively. For the definition of IRS individual  taxpayer identification number, see paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  For the definition of IRS adoption taxpayer identification number, see  Sec. 301.6109-3(a). Except as   otherwise provided in applicable regulations under this chapter or on a  return, statement, or other document, and related instructions, taxpayer  identifying numbers must be used as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) and (D)  of this section, and Sec. 301.6109-3, an individual required to furnish  a taxpayer identifying number must use a social security number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of this  section and Sec. 301.6109-3, an individual required to furnish a  taxpayer identifying number but who is not eligible to obtain a social  security number must use an IRS individual taxpayer identification  number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any person other than an individual (such as corporations,  partnerships, nonprofit associations, trusts, estates, and similar  nonindividual persons) that is required to furnish a taxpayer  identifying number must use an employer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An individual, whether U.S. or foreign, who is an employer or  who is engaged in a trade or business as a sole proprietor should use an  employer identification number as required by returns, statements, or  other documents and their related instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A trust that is treated as owned by one or more persons pursuant  to sections 671 through 678--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtaining a taxpayer identification  number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Unless the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)  of this section applies, a trust that is treated as owned by one or more  persons under sections 671 through 678 must obtain a taxpayer  identification number as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for a trust all of which is treated as owned by one  grantor or one other person and that reports under Sec. 1.671- 4(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. A trust that is treated as owned by one  grantor or one other person under sections 671 through 678 need not  obtain a taxpayer identification number, provided the trust reports  pursuant to Sec. 1.671-4(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. The trustee must  obtain a taxpayer identification number as provided in paragraph (d)(2)  of this section for the first taxable year that the trust is no longer  owned by one grantor or one other person or for the first taxable year  that the trust does not report pursuant to Sec. 1.671-4(b)(2)(i)(A) of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligations of persons who make payments to certain trusts. Any  payor that is required to file an information return with respect to  payments of income or proceeds to a trust must show the name and  taxpayer identification number that the trustee has furnished to the  payor on the return. Regardless of whether the trustee furnishes to the  payor the name and taxpayer identification number of the grantor or  other person treated as an owner of the trust, or the name and taxpayer  identification number of the trust, the payor must furnish a statement  to recipients to the trustee of the trust, rather than to the grantor or  other person treated as the owner of the trust. Under these  circumstances, the payor satisfies the obligation to show the name and  taxpayer identification number of the payee on the information return  and to furnish a statement to recipients to the person whose taxpayer  identification number is required to be shown on the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obtaining a taxpayer identification number for a trust, or  portion of a trust, following the death of the individual treated as the  owner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A trust all of which was treated as owned by  a decedent. In general, a trust all of which is treated as owned by a  decedent under subpart E (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter  J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as of the date of the  decedent's death must obtain a new taxpayer identification number  following the death of the decedent if the trust will continue after the  death of the decedent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxpayer identification number of trust with multiple owners.  With respect to a portion of a trust treated as owned under subpart E  (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 (subpart E)  of the Internal Revenue Code by a decedent as of the date of the  decedent's death, if, following the death of the decedent, the portion  treated as owned by the decedent remains part of the original trust and  the other portion (or portions) of the trust continues to be treated as  owned under   subpart E by a grantor(s) or other person(s), the trust reports under  the taxpayer identification number assigned to the trust prior to the  decedent's death and the portion of the trust treated as owned by the  decedent prior to the decedent's death (assuming the decedent's portion  of the trust is not treated as terminating upon the decedent's death)  continues to report under the taxpayer identification number used for  reporting by the other portion (or portions) of the trust. For example,  if a trust, reporting under Sec. 1.671-4(a) of this chapter, is treated  as owned by three persons and one of them dies, the trust, including the  portion of the trust no longer treated as owned by a grantor or other  person, continues to report under the tax identification number assigned  to the trust prior to the death of that person. See Sec. 1.671-4(a) of  this chapter regarding rules for filing the Form 1041, ``U.S. Income Tax  Return for Estates and Trusts,'' where only a portion of the trust is  treated as owned by one or more persons under subpart E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Furnishing correct taxpayer identification number to payors  following the death of the decedent. If the trust continues after the  death of the decedent and is required to obtain a new taxpayer  identification number under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the  trustee must furnish payors with a new Form W-9, ``Request for Taxpayer  Identification Number and Certification,'' or an acceptable substitute  Form W-9, containing the new taxpayer identification number required  under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the name of the trust, and  the address of the trustee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Taxpayer identification number to be used by a trust upon  termination of a section 645 election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If there is an executor. Upon  the termination of the section 645 election period, if there is an  executor, the trustee of the former electing trust may need to obtain a  taxpayer identification number. If Sec. 1.645-1(g) of this chapter  regarding the appointment of an executor after a section 645 election is  made applies to the electing trust, the electing trust must obtain a new  TIN upon termination of the election period. See the instructions to the  Form 1041 for whether a new taxpayer identification number is required  for other former electing trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is no executor. Upon termination of the section 645  election period, if there is no executor, the trustee of the former  electing trust must obtain a new taxpayer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirement to provide taxpayer identification number to  payors. If the trustee is required to obtain a new taxpayer  identification number for a former electing trust pursuant to this  paragraph (a)(4), or pursuant to the instructions to the Form 1041, the  trustee must furnish all payors of the trust with a completed Form W-9  or acceptable substitute Form W-9 signed under penalties of perjury by  the trustee providing each payor with the name of the trust, the new  taxpayer identification number, and the address of the trustee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Persons treated as payors. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2),  (3), and (4) of this section, a payor is a person described in  Sec. Sec. 1.671-4(b)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section  apply to trusts of decedents dying on or after December 24, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirement to furnish one's own number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> U.S. persons. Every  U.S. person who makes under this title a return, statement, or other  document must furnish its own taxpayer identifying number as required by  the forms and the accompanying instructions. A U.S. person whose number  must be included on a document filed by another person must give the  taxpayer identifying number so required to the other person on request.  For penalties for failure to supply taxpayer identifying numbers, see  sections 6721 through 6724. For provisions dealing specifically with the  duty of employees with respect to their social security numbers, see  Sec. 31.6011(b)-2 (a) and (b) of this chapter (Employment Tax  Regulations). For provisions dealing specifically with the duty of  employers with respect to employer identification numbers, see Sec.  31.6011(b)-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign persons. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section regarding the furnishing of one's own number   shall apply to the following foreign persons--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A foreign person that has income effectively connected with the  conduct of a U.S. trade or business at any time during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A foreign person that has a U.S. office or place of business or  a U.S. fiscal or paying agent at any time during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonresident alien treated as a resident under section  6013(g) or (h);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A foreign person that makes a return of tax (including income,  estate, and gift tax returns), an amended return, or a refund claim  under this title but excluding information returns, statements, or  documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A foreign person that makes an election under Sec. 301.7701- 3(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A foreign person that furnishes a withholding certificate  described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2) or (3) of this chapter or Sec.  1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv) or (3)(iii) of this chapter to the extent required  under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> applies as of November 3, 2003; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> shall apply  to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such  earlier time as the regulations under Sec. Sec. 1.1446-1 through  1.1446-5 of this chapter apply by reason of an election under Sec.  1.1446-7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> to paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section shall apply to partnership  taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the  regulations under Sec. Sec. 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 of this chapter  apply by reason of an election under Sec. 1.1446-7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Obtaining a taxpayer identifying number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Social security  number. Any individual required to furnish a social security number  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall apply for one, if he has  not done so previously, on Form SS-5, which may be obtained from any  Social Security Administration or Internal Revenue Service office. He  shall make such application far enough in advance of the first required  use of such number to permit issuance of the number in time for  compliance with such requirement. The form, together with any  supplementary statement, shall be prepared and filed in accordance with  the form, instructions, and regulations applicable thereto, and shall  set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. Individuals who   are ineligible for or do not wish to participate in the benefits of the  social security program shall nevertheless obtain a social security  number if they are required to furnish such a number pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer identification number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Any person  required to furnish an employer identification number must apply for  one, if not done so previously, on Form SS-4. A Form SS-4 may be  obtained from any office of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. consular  office abroad, or from an acceptance agent described in paragraph  (d)(3)(iv) of this section. The person must make such application far  enough in advance of the first required use of the employer  identification number to permit issuance of the number in time for  compliance with such requirement. The form, together with any  supplementary statement, must be prepared and filed in accordance with  the form, accompanying instructions, and relevant regulations, and must  set forth fully and clearly the requested data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Updating of application information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requirements. Persons  issued employer identification numbers in accordance with the  application process set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section  must provide to the Internal Revenue Service any updated application  information in the manner and frequency required by forms, instructions,  or other appropriate guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this  section applies to all persons possessing an employer identification  number on or after January 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> to the termination in a consistent manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IRS individual taxpayer identification number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition.  The term IRS individual taxpayer identification number means a taxpayer  identifying number issued to an alien individual by the Internal Revenue  Service, upon application, for use in connection with filing  requirements under this title. The term IRS individual taxpayer  identification number does not refer to a social security number or an  account number for use in employment for wages. For purposes of this  section, the term alien individual means an individual who is not a  citizen or national of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rule for obtaining number. Any individual who is not  eligible to obtain a social security number and is required to furnish a  taxpayer identifying number must apply for an IRS individual taxpayer  identification number on Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual  Taxpayer Identification Number, or such other form as may be prescribed  by the Internal Revenue Service. Form W-7 may be obtained from any  office of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. consular office abroad, or  any acceptance agent described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section.  The individual shall furnish the information required by the form and  accompanying instructions, including the individual's name, address,  foreign tax identification number (if any), and specific reason for  obtaining an IRS individual taxpayer identification number. The  individual must make such application far enough in advance of the first  required use of the IRS individual taxpayer identification number to  permit issuance of the number in time for compliance with such  requirement. The application form, together with any supplementary  statement and documentation, must be prepared and filed in accordance  with the form, accompanying instructions, and relevant regulations, and  must set forth fully and clearly the requested data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> General rule for assigning number. Under procedures issued by  the Internal Revenue Service, an IRS individual taxpayer identification  number will be assigned to an individual upon the basis of information  reported on Form   W-7 (or such other form as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue  Service) and any such accompanying documentation that may be required by  the Internal Revenue Service. An applicant for an IRS individual  taxpayer identification number must submit such documentary evidence as  the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in order to establish alien  status and identity. Examples of acceptable documentary evidence for  this purpose may include items such as an original (or a certified copy  of the original) passport, driver's license, birth certificate, identity  card, or immigration documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(B)</em> of this section will be  accepted by the Internal Revenue Service to act as an acceptance agent  for purposes of the regulations under this section upon entering into an  agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, under which the acceptance  agent will be authorized to act on behalf of taxpayers seeking to obtain  a taxpayer identifying number from the Internal Revenue Service. The  agreement must contain such terms and conditions as are necessary to  insure proper administration of the process by which the Internal  Revenue Service issues taxpayer identifying numbers to foreign persons,  including proof of their identity and foreign status. In particular, the  agreement may contain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Procedures for providing Form SS-4 and Form W-7, or such other  necessary form to applicants for obtaining a taxpayer identifying  number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for providing assistance to applicants in completing  the application form or completing it for them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for collecting, reviewing, and maintaining, in the  normal course of business, a record of the required documentation for  assignment of a taxpayer identifying number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedures for submitting the application form and required  documentation to the Internal Revenue Service, or if permitted under the  agreement, submitting the application form together with a certification  that the acceptance agent has reviewed the required documentation and  that it has no actual knowledge or reason to know that the documentation  is not complete or accurate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedures for assisting taxpayers with notification procedures  described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section in the event of change of  foreign status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Procedures for making all documentation or other records  furnished by persons applying for a taxpayer identifying number promptly  available for review by the Internal Revenue Service, upon request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Provisions that the agreement may be terminated in the event of  a material failure to comply with the agreement, including failure to  exercise due diligence under the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> that seeks to qualify  as an acceptance agent must have an employer identification number for  use in any communication with the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,  it must establish to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service  that it has adequate resources and procedures in place to comply with  the terms of the agreement described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination of taxpayer identifying numbers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Social  security number. Any individual who is duly assigned a social security  number or who is entitled to a social security number will not be issued  an IRS individual taxpayer identification number. The individual can use  the social security number for all tax purposes under this title, even  though the individual is, or later becomes, a nonresident alien  individual. Further, any individual who has an application pending with  the Social Security Administration will be issued an IRS individual  taxpayer identification number only after the Social Security   Administration has notified the individual that a social security number  cannot be issued. Any alien individual duly issued an IRS individual  taxpayer identification number who later becomes a U.S. citizen, or an  alien lawfully permitted to enter the United States either for permanent  residence or under authority of law permitting U.S. employment, will be  required to obtain a social security number. Any individual who has an  IRS individual taxpayer identification number and a social security  number, due to the circumstances described in the preceding sentence,  must notify the Internal Revenue Service of the acquisition of the  social security number and must use the newly-issued social security  number as the taxpayer identifying number on all future returns,  statements, or other documents filed under this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer identification number. Any individual with both a  social security number (or an IRS individual taxpayer identification  number) and an employer identification number may use the social  security number (or the IRS individual taxpayer identification number)  for individual taxes, and the employer identification number for  business taxes as required by returns, statements, and other documents  and their related instructions. Any alien individual duly assigned an  IRS individual taxpayer identification number who also is required to  obtain an employer identification number must furnish the previously- assigned IRS individual taxpayer identification number to the Internal  Revenue Service on Form SS-4 at the time of application for the employer  identification number. Similarly, where an alien individual has an  employer identification number and is required to obtain an IRS  individual taxpayer identification number, the individual must furnish  the previously-assigned employer identification number to the Internal  Revenue Service on Form W-7, or such other form as may be prescribed by  the Internal Revenue Service, at the time of application for the IRS  individual taxpayer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Banks, and brokers and dealers in securities. For additional  requirements relating to deposits, share accounts, and brokerage  accounts, see 31 CFR 103.34 and 103.35.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Penalty. For penalties for failure to supply taxpayer  identifying numbers, see sections 6721 through 6724.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special rules for taxpayer identifying numbers issued to foreign  persons--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Social security number. A social security  number is generally identified in the records and database of the  Internal Revenue Service as a number belonging to a U.S. citizen or  resident alien individual. A person may establish a different status for  the number by providing proof of foreign status with the Internal  Revenue Service under such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service  shall prescribe, including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue  Service may specify. Upon accepting an individual as a nonresident alien  individual, the Internal Revenue Service will assign this status to the  individual's social security number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer identification number. An employer identification  number is generally identified in the records and database of the  Internal Revenue Service as a number belonging to a U.S. person.  However, the Internal Revenue Service may establish a separate class of  employer identification numbers solely dedicated to foreign persons  which will be identified as such in the records and database of the  Internal Revenue Service. A person may establish a different status for  the number either at the time of application or subsequently by  providing proof of U.S. or foreign status with the Internal Revenue  Service under such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service shall  prescribe, including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue Service  may specify. The Internal Revenue Service may require a person to apply  for the type of employer identification number that reflects the status  of that person as a U.S. or foreign person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> IRS individual taxpayer identification number. An IRS  individual taxpayer identification number is generally identified in the  records and database of the Internal Revenue Service as a number  belonging to a nonresident alien individual. If the Internal Revenue  Service determines at the time of application or subsequently,   that an individual is not a nonresident alien individual, the Internal  Revenue Service may require that the individual apply for a social  security number. If a social security number is not available, the  Internal Revenue Service may accept that the individual use an IRS  individual taxpayer identification number, which the Internal Revenue  Service will identify as a number belonging to a U.S. resident alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change of foreign status. Once a taxpayer identifying number is  identified in the records and database of the Internal Revenue Service  as a number belonging to a U.S. or foreign person, the status of the  number is permanent until the circumstances of the taxpayer change. A  taxpayer whose status changes (for example, a nonresident alien  individual with a social security number becomes a U.S. resident alien)  must notify the Internal Revenue Service of the change of status under  such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service shall prescribe,  including the use of a form as the Internal Revenue Service may specify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> applies to payments made  after December 31, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rules for certain entities under Sec. 301.7701-3--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. Any entity that has an employer identification number  (EIN) will retain that EIN if its federal tax classification changes  under Sec. 301.7701-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for entities that are disregarded as entities  separate from their owners--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When an entity becomes disregarded as an  entity separate from its owner. Except as otherwise provided in  regulations or other guidance, a single owner entity that is disregarded  as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3, must use  its owner's taxpayer identifying number (TIN) for federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When an entity that was disregarded as an entity separate from  its owner becomes recognized as a separate entity. If a single owner  entity's classification changes so that it is recognized as a separate  entity for federal tax purposes, and that entity had an EIN, then the  entity must use that EIN and not the TIN of the single owner. If the  entity did not already have its own EIN, then the entity must acquire an  EIN and not use the TIN of the single owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. The rules of this paragraph (h) are applicable  as of January 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special rule for qualified subchapter S subsidiaries (QSubs)-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Any entity that has an employer identification number  (EIN) will retain that EIN if a QSub election is made for the entity  under Sec. 1.1361-3 or if a QSub election that was in effect for the  entity terminates under Sec. 1.1361-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EIN while QSub election in effect. Except as otherwise provided  in regulations or other published guidance, a QSub must use the parent S  corporation's EIN for Federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EIN when QSub election terminates. If an entity's QSub election  terminates, it may not use the EIN of the parent S corporation after the  termination. If the entity had an EIN prior to becoming a QSub or  obtained an EIN while it was a QSub in accordance with regulations or  other published guidance, the entity must use that EIN. If the entity  had no EIN, it must obtain an EIN upon termination of the QSub election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. The rules of this paragraph (i) apply on January  20, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided  in this paragraph (j), the provisions of this section are generally  effective for information that must be furnished after April 15,   1974. However, the provisions relating to IRS individual taxpayer  identification numbers apply on and after May 29, 1996. An application  for an IRS individual taxpayer identification number (Form W-7) may be  filed at any time on or after July 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer identification number of an estate.  The requirement under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that an  estate obtain an employer identification number applies on and after  January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxpayer identifying numbers of certain foreign persons. The  requirement under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section that certain  foreign persons furnish a TIN on a return of tax is effective for tax  returns filed after December 31, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) introductory text,  (a)(1)(ii)(A), and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section apply to income tax  returns due (without regard to extensions) on or after April 15, 1998.
