                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Considering borrower requests for servicing. Any request for servicing is the borrower's acknowledgment that the Agency will not interfere with any rights or protections under the Bankruptcy Code and its automatic stay provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Borrowers with confirmed bankruptcy plans. If a plan is confirmed before servicing and any appeal is completed under 7 CFR part 11, the Agency will complete the servicing or appeals process and may consent to a post-confirmation modification of the plan if it is consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and subpart C of this part, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Chapter 7 borrowers. A borrower filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code may not receive primary loan servicing unless the borrower reaffirms the entire FLP debt. A borrower who filed chapter 7 does not have to reaffirm the debt in order to be considered for homestead protection.
