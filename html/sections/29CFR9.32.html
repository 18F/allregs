Any aggrieved party may file a request for a hearing by an  Administrative Law Judge within 20 days of the determination of the  Administrator. The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy  of the determination of the Administrator and may be filed by U.S. mail,  facsimile (FAX), telegram, hand delivery, next-day delivery, or a  similar service. At the same time, a copy of any request for a hearing  shall be sent to the complainant(s) or successor contractor, and their  representatives, if any, as appropriate; the Administrator of the Wage  and Hour Division; and the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor  Standards, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By the complainant. The complainant or any other interested  party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines, after  investigation, that there is no basis for a finding that a contractor  has committed violation(s), or where the complainant or other interested  party believes that the Administrator has ordered inadequate monetary  relief. In such a proceeding, the party requesting the hearing shall be  the prosecuting party and the contractor shall be the respondent; the  Administrator may intervene as a party or appear as amicus curiae at any  time in the proceeding, at the Administrator's discretion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By the contractor.

Any  aggrieved party desiring review of a determination of the Administrator  in which there were no relevant facts in dispute, or an Administrative  Law Judge's decision, shall file a written petition for review with the  Administrative Review Board that must be postmarked within 20 days of  the date of the determination or decision and shall be served on all  parties and, where the case involves an appeal from an Administrative  Law Judge's decision, the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

If a timely request for hearing or petition  for review is   filed, the determination of the Administrator or the decision of the  Administrative Law Judge shall be inoperative unless and until the  Administrative Review Board issues an order affirming the determination  or decision, or the determination or decision otherwise becomes a final  order of the Secretary. If a petition for review concerns only the  imposition of ineligibility sanctions, however, the remainder of the  decision shall be effective immediately. No judicial review shall be  available unless a timely petition for review to the Administrative  Review Board is first filed.</p>
