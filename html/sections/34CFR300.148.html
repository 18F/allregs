                                Sec. 300.148  Placement of children by parents when FAPE is at issue.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This part does not require an LEA to pay for the cost  of education, including special education and related services, of a  child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency  made FAPE available to the child and the parents elected to place the  child in a private school or facility. However, the public agency must  include that child in the population whose needs are addressed  consistent with Secs. 300.131 through 300.144.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disagreements about FAPE. Disagreements between the parents and  a public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for  the child, and the question of financial reimbursement, are subject to  the due process procedures in Secs. 300.504 through 300.520.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reimbursement for private school placement. If the parents of a  child with a disability, who previously received special education and  related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the  child in a private preschool, elementary school, or secondary school  without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a  hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the  cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the  agency had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior  to that enrollment and that the private placement is appropriate. A  parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a hearing officer  or a court even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to  education provided by the SEA and LEAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on reimbursement. The cost of reimbursement described  in paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced or denied--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the most recent IEP Team meeting that the parents attended  prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did  not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed  by the public agency to provide FAPE to their child, including stating  their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private  school at public expense; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that  occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the  public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public  agency of the information described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, prior to the parents' removal of the child from the public  school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice  requirements described in Sec. 300.503(a)(1), of its intent to evaluate  the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that  was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child  available for the evaluation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to  actions taken by the parents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding the notice requirement in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, the cost of reimbursement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must not be reduced or denied for failure to provide the notice  if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The school prevented the parents from providing the notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The parents had not received notice, pursuant to Sec. 300.504,  of the notice requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely  result in physical harm to the child; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May, in the discretion of the court or a hearing officer, not be  reduced or denied for failure to provide this notice if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The parents are not literate or cannot write in English; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely  result in serious emotional harm to the child.
