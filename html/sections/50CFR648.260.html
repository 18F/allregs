                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual review and specifications process. The Council, the Red  Crab Plan   Development Team (PDT), and the Red Crab Advisory Panel shall monitor  the status of the red crab fishery and resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Red Crab PDT shall meet at least once annually during the  intervening years between Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE)  Reports, described in paragraph (b) of this section, to review the  status of the stock and the fishery. Based on such review, the PDT shall  provide a report to the Council on any changes or new information about  the red crab stock and/or fishery, and it shall recommend whether the  specifications for the upcoming year(s) need to be modified. At a  minimum, this review shall include a review of at least the following  data, if available: Commercial catch data; current estimates of fishing  mortality and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE); discards; stock status;  recent estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results and  other estimates of stock size; sea sampling, port sampling, and survey  data or, if sea sampling data are unavailable, length frequency  information from port sampling and/or surveys; impact of other fisheries  on the mortality of red crabs; and any other relevant information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If new and/or additional information becomes available, the Red  Crab PDT shall consider it during this annual review. Based on this  review, the Red Crab PDT shall provide guidance to the Red Crab  Committee and the Council regarding the need to adjust measures in the  Red Crab FMP to better achieve the FMP's objectives. After considering  guidance, the Council may submit to NMFS its recommendations for changes  to management measures, as appropriate, through the specifications  process described in this section, the framework process specified in  Sec. 648.261, or through an amendment to the FMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Based on the annual review, described above, and/or the SAFE  Report described in paragraph (b) of this section, recommendations for  acceptable biological catch (ABC) from the Scientific and Statistical  Committee (SSC), and any other relevant information, the Red Crab PDT  shall recommend to the Red Crab Committee and Council the following  specifications for harvest of red crab: an annual catch limit (ACL) set  less than or equal to ABC; and total allowable landings (TAL) necessary  to meet the objectives of the FMP in each red crab fishing year,  specified for a period of up to 3 fishing years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The PDT, after its review of the available information on the  status of the stock and the fishery, may recommend to the Council any  measures necessary to assure that the specifications will not be  exceeded, as well as changes to the appropriate specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Taking into account the annual review and/or SAFE Report  described in paragraph (b) of this section, the advice of the SSC, and  any other relevant information, the Red Crab PDT may also recommend to  the Red Crab Committee and Council changes to stock status determination  criteria and associated thresholds based on the best scientific  information available, including information from peer-reviewed stock  assessments of red crab. These adjustments may be included in the  Council's specifications for the red crab fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Council recommendation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Council shall review the  recommendations of the Red Crab PDT, Red Crab Committee, and SSC, any  public comment received thereon, and any other relevant information, and  make a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on appropriate  specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the  specifications will not be exceeded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Council's recommendation must include supporting  documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic,  and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator  shall consider the recommendations and publish a rule in the Federal  Register proposing specifications and associated measures, consistent  with the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Regional Administrator may propose specifications  different than those recommended by the Council. If the specifications  published in the Federal Register differ from those recommended by the  Council, the reasons for any differences must be clearly stated and the  revised specifications   must satisfy the criteria set forth in this section, the FMP, and other  applicable laws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the final specifications are not published in the Federal  Register for the start of the fishing year, the previous year's  specifications shall remain in effect until superseded by the final rule  implementing the current year's specifications, to ensure that there is  no lapse in regulations while new specifications are completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SAFE Report. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Red Crab PDT shall prepare a SAFE Report at  least every 3 yr. Based on the SAFE Report, the Red Crab PDT shall  develop and present to the Council recommended specifications as defined  in paragraph (a) of this section for up to 3 fishing years. The SAFE  Report shall be the primary vehicle for the presentation of all updated  biological and socio-economic information regarding the red crab  fishery. The SAFE Report shall provide source data for any adjustments  to the management measures that may be needed to continue to meet the  goals and objectives of the FMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any year in which a SAFE Report is not completed by the Red  Crab PDT, the annual review process described in paragraph (a) of this  section shall be used to recommend any necessary adjustments to  specifications and/or management measures in the FMP.
