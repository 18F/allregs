Any person having prior involvement in  the matter which is the basis for the suspension or debarment proceeding  is disqualified from representing the OCC in the hearing. The hearing  will be closed to the public unless the Comptroller on his or her own  initiative, or on the request of a party, otherwise directs. The  administrative law judge shall issue a recommended decision to the  Comptroller who shall issue the final decision and order. The  Comptroller may censure, debar or suspend an individual, or take such  other disciplinary action as the Comptroller deems appropriate.</p>
