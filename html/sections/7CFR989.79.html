                            <p class="depth0">The committee is authorized to incur such expenses (other than those  specified in Sec. 989.82) as the Secretary finds are reasonable and  likely to be incurred by it during each crop year, for the maintenance  and functioning of the committee and for such purposes as he may,  pursuant to this subpart, determine to be appropriate. The funds to  cover such expenses shall be obtained levying assessments as provided in  Sec. 989.80. The committee shall file with the Secretary for each crop  year a proposed budget of these expenses and a proposal as to the  assessment rate to be fixed pursuant to Sec. 989.80, together with a  report thereon. Such filing shall be not later than October 5 of the  crop year, but this date may be extended by the committee not more than  5 days if warranted by a late crop. Also it shall file at the same time  a proposed budget of the expenses likely to be incurred during the crop  year in connection with reserve raisins held for the account of the  committee, exclusive of the receiving, storing, fumigating, and handling  expenses which are covered by a schedule of payments to handlers  effective pursuant to Sec. 989.66(f) or any rules and procedures  established by the committee, and exclusive of any expenses it may incur  in connection with the disposition of such raisins and which are unknown  at the time. The said report shall also cover this proposed budget.  [32 FR 12165, Aug. 24, 1967, as amended at 41 FR 32417, Aug. 3, 1976; 42  FR 37202, July 20, 1977]</p>
