                            <p class="depth0">The area of review for each injection well or each field, project or area of the State shall be determined according to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Director may solicit input from the owners or operators of injection wells within the State as to which method is most appropriate for each geographic area or field.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Zone of endangering influence.

The following modified Theis equation illustrates one form which the mathematical model may take.

r=Radius of endangering influence from injection well (length)k=Hydraulic conductivity of the injection zone (length/time)H=Thickness of the injection zone (length)t=Time of injection (time)S=Storage coefficient (dimensionless)Q=Injection rate (volume/time)hbo=Observed original hydrostatic head of injection zone</p><p class="depth3"><em>(length)</em> measured from the base of the lowermost underground</p><p class="depth3">source of drinking waterhw=Hydrostatic head of underground source of drinking water</p><p class="depth3"><em>(length)</em> measured from the base of the lowest underground</p><p class="depth3">source of drinking waterSp Gb=Specific gravity of fluid in the injection</p><p class="depth3">zone (dimensionless)[pi]=3.142 (dimensionless)

(1) In the case of application(s) for well permit(s) under Sec.  122.38 a fixed radius around the well of not less than one-fourth (\1/4\) mile may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of application(s) for well permit(s) under Sec.  122.38 a fixed radius around the well of not less than one-fourth (\1/4\) mile may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an application for an area permit under Sec.  122.39 a fixed width of not less than one-fourth (\1/4\) mile for the circumscribing area may be used.
In determining the fixed radius, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: Chemistry of injected and formation fluids; hydrogeology; population and ground-water use and dependence; and historical practices in the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the area of review is determined by a mathematical model pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the permissible radius is the result of such calculation even if it is less than one-fourth (\1/4\) mile.
