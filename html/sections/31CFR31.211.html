                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Retained entity's responsibility. A retained entity working  under an arrangement shall not permit an actual or potential  organizational conflict of interest (including a situation in which the  retained entity has an interest or relationship that could cause a  reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the  retained entity's objectivity or judgment to perform under the  arrangement or its ability to represent the Treasury), unless the  conflict has been disclosed to Treasury under this Section and mitigated  under a plan approved by Treasury, or Treasury has waived the conflict.  With respect to arrangements for the acquisition, valuation, management,  or disposition of troubled assets, the retained entity shall maintain a  compliance program reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations  of federal securities laws and organizational conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information required about the retained entity. As early as  possible before entering an arrangement to perform services for Treasury  under the EESA, a retained entity shall provide Treasury with sufficient  information to evaluate any organizational conflicts of interest. The  information shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The retained entity's relationship to any related entities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The categories of troubled assets owned or controlled by the  retained entity and its related entities, if the arrangement relates to  the acquisition, valuation, disposition, or management of troubled  assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information concerning all other business or financial interests  of the retained entity, its proposed subcontractors, or its related  entities, which could conflict with the retained entity's obligations  under the arrangement with Treasury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of all organizational conflicts of interest and  potential conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A written detailed plan to mitigate all organizational conflicts  of interest, along with supporting documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other information or documentation about the retained  entity, its proposed subcontractors, or its related entities that  Treasury may request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Plans to mitigate organizational conflicts of interest. The  steps necessary to mitigate a conflict may depend on a variety of  factors, including the type of conflict, the scope of work under the  arrangement, and the organizational structure of the retained entity.  Some conflicts may be so substantial and pervasive that they cannot be  mitigated. Retained entities should consider the following measures when  designing a mitigation plan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adopting, implementing, and enforcing appropriate information  barriers to prevent unauthorized people from learning nonpublic  information relating to the arrangement and isolate key individuals from  learning how their performance under the arrangement could affect the  financial interests of the retained entity, its clients, and related  entities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Divesting assets that give rise to conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terminating or refraining from business relationships that give  rise to conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If consistent with the terms of the arrangement and permitted by  Treasury, refraining from performing specific types of work under the  arrangement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other steps appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certification required. When the retained entity provides the  information required by paragraph (b) of this section, the retained  entity shall certify that the information is complete and accurate in  all material respects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination required. Prior to entering into any arrangement,  the Treasury must conclude that no organizational conflict of interest  exists that has not been adequately mitigated, or if a conflict cannot  be adequately mitigated, that Treasury has   expressly waived it. Once Treasury has approved a conflicts mitigation  plan, the plan becomes an enforceable term under the arrangement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent notification. The retained entity has a continuing  obligation to search for, report, and mitigate any and all potential  organizational conflicts of interest that have not already been  disclosed to Treasury under a plan approved by Treasury or previously  waived by Treasury. The retained entity shall search regularly for  conflicts and shall, within five (5) business days after learning of a  potential organizational conflict of interest, disclose the potential  conflict of interest in writing to the TARP Chief Compliance Officer.  The disclosure shall describe the steps it has taken or proposes to take  to mitigate the potential conflict or request a waiver from Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Periodic Certification. No later than one year after the  arrangement's effective date, and at least annually thereafter, the  retained entity shall certify in writing that it has no organizational  conflicts of interest, or explain in detail the extent to which it can  certify, and describe the actions it has taken and plans to take to  mitigate any conflicts. Treasury may require more frequent  certifications, depending on the arrangement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retention of information. A retained entity shall retain the  information needed to comply with this section and to support the  certifications required by this section for three (3) years following  termination or expiration of the arrangement, and shall make that  information available to Treasury upon request. Such retained  information shall include, but is not limited to, written documentation  regarding the factors the retained entity considered in its mitigation  plan as well as written documentation addressing the results of the  retained entities' periodic review of the mitigation plan.</p>
