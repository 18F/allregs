The agency may determine  that other metadata is needed to meet agency business needs, e.g.,  receipt information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attachments to electronic mail messages that are an integral  part of the record must be preserved as part of the electronic mail  record or linked to the electronic mail record with other related  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the electronic mail system identifies users by codes or  nicknames or identifies addressees only by the name of a distribution  list, retain the intelligent or full names on directories or   distributions lists to ensure identification of the sender and  addressee(s) of messages that are records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Some e-mail systems provide calendars and task lists for users.  These may meet the definition of Federal record. Calendars that meet the  definition of Federal records are to be managed in accordance with the  provisions of GRS 23, Item 5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Draft documents that are circulated on electronic mail systems  may be records if they meet the criteria specified in 36 CFR 1222.10(b)  of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official  electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must  ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are  preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agencies may elect to manage electronic mail records with very  short-term NARA-approved retention periods (transitory records with a  very short-term retention period of 180 days or less as provided by GRS  23, Item 7, or by a NARA-approved agency records schedule) on the  electronic mail system itself, without the need to copy the record to a  paper or electronic recordkeeping system, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Users do not delete the messages before the expiration of the  NARA-approved retention period, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system's automatic deletion rules ensure preservation of the  records until the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except for those electronic mail records within the scope of  paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies must not use an electronic mail system to store the  recordkeeping copy of electronic mail messages identified as Federal  records unless that system has all of the features specified in Sec.  1236.20(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the electronic mail system is not designed to be a  recordkeeping system, agencies must instruct staff on how to copy  Federal records from the electronic mail system to a recordkeeping  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agencies that retain permanent electronic mail records scheduled  for transfer to the National Archives must either store them in a format  and on a medium that conforms to the requirements concerning transfer at  36 CFR part 1235 or maintain the ability to convert the records to the  required format and medium at the time transfer is scheduled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Agencies that maintain paper recordkeeping systems must print  and file their electronic mail records with the related transmission and  receipt data specified by the agency's electronic mail instructions.</p>
