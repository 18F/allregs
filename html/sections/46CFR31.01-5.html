The inspection shall be such as to insure that the arrangements, material, and scantlings of the structure, boilers and other pressure vessels and their appurtenances, piping, main and auxiliary machinery, electrical installations, lifesaving appliances, fire-detecting and extinguishing equipment, pilot boarding equipment and other equipment fully comply with the applicable regulations for such vessel and are in accordance with approved plans, and determine that the vessel is in possession of a valid certificate issued by the Federal Communications Commission, if any. The inspection shall be such as to ensure that the workmanship of all parts of the vessel and its equipment is in all respects satisfactory and that the vessel is provided with lights, means of making sound signals, and distress signals as required by applicable statutes and regulations.
