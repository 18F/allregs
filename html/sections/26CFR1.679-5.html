                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a nonresident alien individual becomes a U.S.  person and the individual has a residency starting date (as determined  under section 7701(b)(2)(A)) within 5 years after directly or indirectly  transferring property to a foreign trust (the original transfer), the  individual is treated as having transferred to the trust on the  residency starting date an amount equal to the portion of the trust  attributable to the property transferred by the individual in the  original transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Change in grantor trust status. For purposes  of paragraph (a) of this section, if a nonresident alien individual who  is treated as owning any portion of a trust under the provisions of  subpart E of part I of subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue  Code, subsequently ceases to be so treated, the individual is treated as  having made the original transfer to the foreign trust immediately  before the trust ceases to be treated as owned by the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of undistributed income. For purposes of paragraph (a)  of this section, the property deemed transferred to the foreign trust on  the residency starting date includes undistributed net income, as  defined in section 665(a), attributable to the property deemed  transferred. Undistributed net income for periods before the  individual's residency starting date is taken into account only for  purposes of determining the amount of the property deemed transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Nonresident alien becomes resident alien. On January 1,  2002, A, a nonresident alien individual, transfers property to a foreign  trust, FT. On January 1, 2006, A becomes a resident of the United States  within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A) and has a residency starting  date of January 1, 2006, within the meaning of section 7701(b)(2)(A).  Under paragraph (a) of this section, A is treated as a U.S. transferor  and is deemed to transfer the property to FT on January 1, 2006. Under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the property deemed transferred to FT  on January 1, 2006, includes the undistributed net income of the trust,  as defined in section 665(a), attributable to the property originally  transferred.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Nonresident alien loses power to revest property. On  January 1, 2002, A, a nonresident alien individual, transfers property  to a foreign trust, FT. A has the power to revest absolutely in himself  the title to such property transferred and is treated as the owner of  the trust pursuant to sections 676 and 672(f). On January 1, 2008, the  terms of FT are amended to remove A's power to   revest in himself title to the property transferred, and A ceases to be  treated as the owner of FT. On January 1, 2010, A becomes a resident of  the United States. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for purposes  of paragraph (a) of this section A is treated as having originally  transferred the property to FT on January 1, 2008. Because this date is  within five years of A's residency starting date, A is deemed to have  made a transfer to the foreign trust on January 1, 2010, his residency  starting date. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the property  deemed transferred to the foreign trust on January 1, 2010, includes the  undistributed net income of the trust, as defined in section 665(a),  attributable to the property deemed transferred.
