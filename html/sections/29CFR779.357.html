                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>   exemption, whether 75 percent of the establishment's sales are  recognized as retail in the particular industry, sales of coal to the  consumer from a dealer's yard storage, where bulk is broken, are  recognized as retail if they meet the requirements for such  classification as previously explained in this subpart. It has been  determined that the following sales do not meet such requirements and  are not so recognized even if made from a dealer's yard storage:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales where the delivery is made by railroad car or cargo  vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales in a carload quantity or more for continuous delivery by  truck from a dock, mine or public railroad facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales of coal at a wholesale price. A wholesale price is a price  comparable to or lower than the establishment's price in sales described  in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section or in sales to dealers (but  not peddlers) for resale. If the establishment makes no such sales, the  wholesale price is the price comparable to or lower than the price  prevailing in the immediate area in sales described in paragraphs (a)(1)  and (2) of this section or in sales to dealers (but not peddlers) for  resale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sales of coal for use in the production of a specific product to  be sold in which coal is an essential ingredient or the principal raw  material, such as sales of coal for the production of coke, coal gas,  coal tar, or electricity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Sales for resale.'' In determining for purposes of the  13(a)(2) exemption, whether 75 percent of the establishment's sales are  not made for resale, ``sales for resale'' will include sales of coal to  other dealers, to peddlers, and sales of coal for use in the production  of a specific product to be sold, in which coal is an essential  ingredient or the principal raw material, such as sales of coal for the  production of coke, coal gas, coal tar, or electricity. This is  distinguished from sales of coal for use in the general manufacturing or  industrial process such as the use in laundries, bakeries, nurseries,  canneries, etc., or for space heating, which are not sales made for  resale.</p><p class="depth2">Ice Manufacturers and Ice Dealers</p>
