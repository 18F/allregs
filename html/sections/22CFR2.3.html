For persons normally accredited to the United States in diplomatic or consular capacities and also for persons normally accredited to the United Nations and other international organizations and in turn notified to the Department of State, the procedure for placing a person in the statutory category of being ``duly notified to the United States'' shall be the current procedure for accreditation, with notification in turn when applicable. The Chief of the Office of Protocol will place on the roster of persons ``duly notified to the United States'' the names of all persons currently accredited and, when applicable, notified in turn, and will maintain the roster as part of the official files of the Department of State adding to and deleting therefrom as changes in accreditations occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For those persons not normally accredited, the Chief of Protocol shall determine upon receipt of notification, by letter from the foreign government or international organization concerned, whether any person who is the subject of such a notification has been duly notified under the Act. Any inquiries by law enforcement officers or other persons as to whether a person has been duly notified shall be directed to the Chief of Protocol. The determination of the Chief of Protocol that a person has been duly notified is final.
