                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, audit costs are an eligible program or administrative expense.  If the Indian tribe is the recipient then program funds can be used to  pay a prorated share of the tribal audit or financial review cost that  is attributable to NAHASDA funded activities. For a recipient not  covered by the Single Audit Act, but which chooses to obtain a periodic  financial review, the cost of such a review would be an eligible program  expense.</p>
