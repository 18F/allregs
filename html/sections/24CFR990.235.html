                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For PHAs that will experience a gain in their operating subsidy, as determined in Sec. 990.225, such increases will have a limit of 50 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the first year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The full amount of the increase in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the second year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For example, a PHA's subsidy increased from $900,000 under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part to $1 million under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million-$900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy increase would be limited to $50,000 (50 percent of the difference). Thus, in this example the PHA will receive the operating subsidy amount of this rule minus a transition-funding amount of $50,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $50,000 transition amount).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The schedule for a PHA whose subsidy would be increased is reflected in the table below.
