For all of the emission sources listed in  paragraph (a) of this section, except the one for which an emission  limit is prescribed in Sec. 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be  conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to 10 ppm. For  the emission source for which an emission limit is prescribed in  Sec. 61.62(b), the   daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl  chloride which is determined to be equivalent to the emission limit for  that source based on the emission test required by Sec. 61.67. The  calibration is to be done with either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in  Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with Section  10.1 of Method 106, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate  concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration  gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The  manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each  cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than [5  percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation,  certified vinyl chloride concentration and recommended maximum shelf  life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the  manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl  chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to  prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1  and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2  of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for  establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be  followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When exhaust gas(es), having emission limits that are subject to  the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, are emitted to the  atmosphere without passing through the control system and required vinyl  chloride monitoring system, the vinyl chloride content of the emission  shall be calculated (in units of each applicable emission limit) by best  practical engineering judgment based on the discharge duration and known  VC concentrations in the affected equipment as determined in accordance  with Sec. 61.67(h) or other acceptable method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each 3-hour period, the vinyl chloride content of emissions  subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section  shall be averaged (weighted according to the proportion of time that  emissions were continuously monitored and that emissions bypassed the  continuous monitor) for purposes of reporting excess emissions under  Sec. 61.70(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each vinyl chloride emission to the atmosphere determined in  accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to be in excess of the  applicable emission limits, the owner or operator shall record the  identity of the source(s), the date, time, and duration of the excess  emission, the cause of the excess emission, and the approximate total  vinyl chloride loss during the excess emission, and the method used for  determining the vinyl chloride loss. This information shall be retained  and made available for inspection by the Administrator as required by  Sec. 61.71(a).
