                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Natural areas are defined as land or water units  where natural conditions are maintained insofar as possible. Natural  conditions usually result from allowing ordinary physical and biological  processes to operate with a minimum of human intervention. Manipulations  may be required on natural areas to maintain or restore features that  the areas were established to protect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Natural areas may be designated areas of Federal, non-Federal  government, or privately controlled land. Designation may be formal as  provided for under federal regulations for areas of federal land to be  administered as natural areas or by foundations or conservation  organizations specifically created to acquire and maintain natural  areas. Designation may be informal in the case of private landowners who  designate a specific area as a natural area and manage it accordingly.  Several professional societies concerned with renewable natural  resources encourage establishment of natural areas withdrawn from  economic uses and recognition of natural areas maintained and managed in  economic enterprises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Natural areas are established and maintained for a variety of  purposes including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furthering science and education. Natural areas provide sites  for research and outdoor classrooms for study of plant and animal  communities in environments with particular ecological conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring the surrounding environment. Natural areas serve as  gauges against which to evaluate changes in land use, vegetation, animal  life, air quality, or other environmental values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Providing recreation attractions. Natural areas are valued by  many people for their scenic, wild, and undisturbed character but must  be protected, as needed, to prevent disturbance or alteration of the  resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Preserving unique values. Natural areas may be established to  protect scenic, biologic, geologic, or paleontologic features.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Serving as a genetic base for native plants and animals. Natural  areas may be established to preserve examples of land and water  ecosystems with their full range of genetic diversity of native plants  and animals including threatened and endangered species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. NRCS will recognize natural areas, if so dedicated, as a  land use, and will support the designation of appropriate natural areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS national office. The Administrator will  designate a member of the national office staff to act as NRCS  representative on the Federal Committee for Ecological Preserves and to  provide appropriate liaison with other federal agencies and non-Federal  groups concerned with natural areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical service center. The TSC director will designate a TSC  plant sciences discipline leader to provide leadership, appropriate  liaison, and assistance on natural areas to NRCS state offices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS state office. The state conservationist will designate an  appropriate NRCS representative to work with other agencies and groups,  and will coordinate assistance on natural areas needed by area and field  offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Coordination and implementation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS technical assistance  will be furnished to representatives of administering agencies,  foundations, groups, and individuals when requested through conservation  districts. Conservation district officers will be encouraged to  recognize appropriate natural areas concepts and programs and to  participate in them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NRCS employees will report to state conservationists abuses and  potential or actual damages to natural areas that may be found in the  course of ordinary business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS will cooperate with professional societies, groups, and  individuals in locating areas suitable for and needed as natural areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> NRCS employees providing technical assistance to land users must  inform them about the impact their decisions may have on adjacent or  nearby natural areas. Land users will be encouraged to consult with  concerned agencies, societies, and individuals to arrive at mutually  satisfactory land use and treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recommended classification systems for characterizing areas  designated as ecological preserves or as natural areas are contained in  the following publications:  Soil Taxonomy, a Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and  Interpreting Soil Surveys, USDA-NRCS Agricultural Handbook 436. Forest Cover Types of North America Exclusive of Mexico, Report of the  Committee on Forest Cover Types, Society of American Foresters, 1964. Potential Natural Vegetation of Conterminous United States. A. W.  Kuchler, American Geographical Society Special Publication 36, 1964. Wetlands classification described by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  in its Circular 39.   NRCS will, to the extent feasible, use these classification systems when  providing technical assistance on public and private natural areas and  ecological preserves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The NRCS published National List of Scientific Plant Names will  be used when scientific names or name symbols are needed for automatic  data processing.</p>
