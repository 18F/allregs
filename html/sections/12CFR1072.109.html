                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Bureau shall operate each program or activity so  that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is accessible  to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not  require the Bureau</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To make structural alterations in each of its existing  facilities in order to make them accessible to and usable by individuals  with disabilities where other methods are effective in achieving  compliance with this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To take any action that would result in a fundamental alteration  in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and  administrative burdens. If an action would result in such an alteration  or such burdens, the Bureau shall take any other action that would not  result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless to  the extent reasonably feasible ensure that individuals with disabilities  receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods. The Bureau may comply with the requirements of this  section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of  services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries,  home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites,  alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities,  use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in  making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by  individuals with disabilities. The Bureau, in making alterations to  existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent  compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42  U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing  among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section,  the Bureau shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and  activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most  integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period for compliance. The Bureau shall comply with the  obligations established under this section within ninety (90) days of  the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in  facilities are undertaken, such changes in facilities are undertaken,  such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of  this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</p>
