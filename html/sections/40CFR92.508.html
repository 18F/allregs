These results must also include the green engine factor, if applicable.

This production line testing program was conducted in complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part 92. No emission-related changes to production processes or quality control procedures for the engine family tested have been made during this production line testing program that affect locomotives or locomotive engines from the production line.
