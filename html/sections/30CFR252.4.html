The Director shall consult with affected States and other  interested parties to define the nature, scope, content, and timing of  the Summary Report. The Director may consult with affected States and  other interested parties regarding subsequent revisions in the  definition of the nature, scope, content, and timing of the Summary  Report. The Summary Report shall not contain data or information which  the Director determines is exempt from disclosure in accordance with  this part. The Summary Report shall not contain data or information the  release of which the Director determines would unduly damage the  competitive position of the lessee or permittee who provided the data or  information which the Director has processed, analyzed, or interpreted  during the development of the Summary Report. The Summary Report shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Estimates of oil and gas reserves; estimates of the oil and gas  resources that may be found within areas which the Secretary has leased  or plans to offer for lease; and when available, projected rates and  volumes of oil and gas to be produced from leased areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Magnitude of the approximate projections and timing of  development, if and when oil or gas, or both, is discovered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methods of transportation to be used, including vessels and  pipelines and approximate location of routes to be followed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General location and nature of near-shore and onshore facilities  expected to be utilized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Director determines that significant changes have  occurred in the information contained in a Summary Report, the Director  shall prepare and make available the new or revised information to each  affected State, and, upon request, to the executive of any affected  local government.</p>
