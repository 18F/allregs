                                Sec. 63.1571  How and when do I conduct a performance test or other
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When must I conduct a performance test? You must conduct performance tests and report the results by no later than 150 days after the compliance date specified for your source in Sec. 63.1563 and according to the provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2). If you are required to do a performance evaluation or test for a semi-regenerative catalytic reforming unit catalyst regenerator vent, you may do them at the first regeneration cycle after your compliance date and report the results in a followup Notification of Compliance Status report due no later than 150 days after the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each emission limitation or work practice standard where initial compliance is not demonstrated using a performance test, opacity observation, or visible emission observation, you must conduct the initial compliance demonstration within 30 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.1563.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each emission limitation where the averaging period is 30 days, the 30-day period for demonstrating initial compliance begins at 12:00 a.m. on the compliance date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.1563 and ends at 11:59 p.m., 30 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.1563.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you commenced construction or reconstruction between September 11, 1998 and April 11, 2002, you must demonstrate initial compliance with either the proposed emission limitation or the promulgated emission limitation no later than October 8, 2002 or within 180 calendar days after startup of the source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you commenced construction or reconstruction between September 11, 1998 and April 11, 2002, and you chose to comply with the proposed emission limitation when demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct a second compliance demonstration for the promulgated emission limitation by October 10, 2005, or after startup of the source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What are the general requirements for performance test and performance evaluations? You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct each performance test according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for opacity and visible emission observations, conduct three separate test runs for each performance test as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conduct each performance evaluation according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calculate the average emission rate for the performance test by calculating the emission rate for each individual test run in the units of the applicable emission limitation using Equation 2, 5, or 8 of Sec. 63.1564, and determining the arithmetic average of the calculated emission rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What procedures must I use for an engineering assessment? You may choose to use an engineering assessment to calculate the process vent flow rate, net heating value, TOC emission rate, and total organic HAP emission rate expected to yield the highest daily emission rate when determining the emission reduction or outlet concentration for the organic HAP standard for catalytic reforming units. If you use an engineering assessment, you must document all data, assumptions, and procedures to the satisfaction of the applicable permitting authority. An engineering assessment may include the approaches listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Other engineering assessments may be used but are subject to review and approval by the applicable permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use previous test results provided the tests are representative of current operating practices at the process unit, and provided EPA methods or approved alternatives were used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may use bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process under representative operating conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may use maximum flow rate, TOC emission rate, organic HAP emission rate, or organic HAP or TOC concentration specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may use design analysis based on engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to estimate maximum TOC concentrations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of hourly average maximum flow rate based on physical equipment design such as pump or blower capacities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Calculation of TOC concentrations based on saturation conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Can I adjust the process or control device measured values when establishing an operating limit? If you do a performance test to demonstrate compliance, you must base the process or control device operating limits for continuous parameter monitoring systems on the results measured during the performance test. You may adjust the values measured during the performance test according to the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you must meet the HAP metal emission limitations in Sec. 63.1564, you elect the option in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) in Sec. 63.1564 (Ni lb/hr), and you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you must establish an operating limit for the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration based on the laboratory analysis of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration from the initial performance test. Section 63.1564(b)(2) allows you to adjust the laboratory measurements of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration to the maximum level. You must make this adjustment using Equation 1 of this section as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11AP02.017
Where:
Ecat-Limit = Operating limit for equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration,</p><p class="depth3">mg/kg;NiEmR1st = Average Ni emission rate calculated as the</p><p class="depth3">arithmetic average Ni emission rate using Equation 5 of this</p><p class="depth3">section for each performance test run, g Ni/hr; andEcatst = Average equilibrium Ni concentration from laboratory</p><p class="depth3">test results, mg/kg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you must meet the HAP metal emission limitations in Sec. 63.1564, you elect the option in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) in Sec. 63.1564 (Ni lb/1,000 lb of coke burn-off), and you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you must establish an operating limit for the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration based on the laboratory analysis of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration from the initial performance test. Section 63.1564(b)(2) allows you to adjust the laboratory measurements of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration to the maximum level. You must make this adjustment using Equation 2 of this section as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11AP02.018
Where:
NiEmR2st = Average Ni emission rate calculated as the</p><p class="depth3">arithmetic average Ni emission rate using Equation 8 of Sec.</p><p class="depth3">63.1564 for each performance test run, mg/kg coke burn-off.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you choose to adjust the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration to the maximum level, you can't adjust

any other monitored operating parameter (i.e., gas flow rate, voltage, pressure drop, liquid-to-gas ratio).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you may adjust one of your monitored operating parameters (flow rate, voltage and secondary current, pressure drop, liquid-to-gas ratio) from the average of measured values during the performance test to the maximum value (or minimum value, if applicable) representative of worst-case operating conditions, if necessary. This adjustment of measured values may be done using control device design specifications, manufacturer recommendations, or other applicable information. You must provide supporting documentation and rationale in your Notification of Compliance Status, demonstrating to the satisfaction of your permitting authority, that your affected source complies with the applicable emission limit at the operating limit based on adjusted values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Can I change my operating limit? You may change the established operating limit by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may change your established operating limit for a continuous parameter monitoring system by doing an additional performance test, a performance test in conjunction with an engineering assessment, or an engineering assessment to verify that, at the new operating limit, you are in compliance with the applicable emission limitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must establish a revised operating limit for your continuous parameter monitoring system if you make any change in process or operating conditions that could affect control system performance or you change designated conditions after the last performance or compliance tests were done. You can establish the revised operating limit as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may change your site-specific opacity operating limit or Ni operating limit only by doing a new performance test.</p>
