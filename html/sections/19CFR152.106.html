                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Elements. The computed value of imported merchandise is the sum  of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost or value of the materials and the fabrication and other  processing of any kind employed in the production of the imported  merchandise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually  reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the  imported merchandise that are made by the producers in the country of  exportation for export to the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (a) (1)  or (2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The packing costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules. (1) The cost or value of materials under  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section will not include the amount of any  internal tax imposed by the country of exportation that is directly  applicable to the materials or their disposition if the tax is remitted  or refunded upon the exportation of the merchandise in the production of  which the materials were used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section will be  based on the usual profit and general expenses of such producers in  those sales, as determined from ``sufficient information''. See Sec.  152.102(j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Profit and general expenses. The amount for profit and general  expenses will be taken as a whole. If the producer's profit figure is  low and general expenses high, those figures taken together nevertheless  may be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of imported  merchandise of the same class or kind.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interpretative note 1. A product is introduced into the United  States, and the producer accepts either no profit or a low profit to  offset the high general expenses required to introduce the product into  this market. If the producer can demonstrate that there is a low profit  on sales of the imported merchandise because of peculiar commercial  circumstances, the actual profit figures will be accepted provided the  producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and his pricing  policy reflects the usual pricing policies in the industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interpretative note 2. Producers have been forced to lower  prices temporarily because of an unforseeable drop in demand, or they  sell merchandise to complement a range of merchandise being produced in  the United States and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness.  If the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not  consistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the  same class or kind as the merchandise being valued which are made in the  country of exportation for export to the United States, the amount for  profit and general expenses will be based upon reliable and quantifiable  information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of  the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assists and packing costs. Computed value also will include an   amount equal to the apportioned value of any assists used in the  production of the imported merchandise and the packing costs for the  imported merchandise. The value of any engineering, development,  artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in the United  States will be included in computed value only to the extent that their  value has been charged to the producer. Depending on the producer's  method of accounting, the value of assists may be included (duplicated)  in the producer's cost of materials, fabrication, and other processing,  or in the general expenses. If duplication occurs, a separate amount for  the value of the assists will not be added to the other elements as it  is not intended that any component of computed value be included twice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Merchandise of same class or kind. Sales for export to the  United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise,  including the merchandise being appraised, will be examined to determine  usual profit and general expenses. For the purpose of computed value,  merchandise of the same class or kind must be from the same country as  the merchandise being appraised.</p><p class="depth2">Example. A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S.  importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated persons.  The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is  determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no  identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production.  The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished  product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of  importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and  the type of processing involved can be accurately costed. The U.S.  importer has requested that the shipment be appraised under computed  value. The profit and general expenses figure for the same class or kind  of merchandise in the country of exportation for export to the U.S. is  known.</p><p class="depth2">How should the merchandise be appraised?</p><p class="depth2">The merchandise should be appraised under computed value, using the  company's profit and general expenses if not inconsistent with those  usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Availability of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It will be presumed that the  computed value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The importer is unable to provide required computed value  information within a reasonable time, and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign producer refuses to provide, or is legally  prevented from providing, that information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the  producer is used to determine computed value, the port director shall  inform the importer, upon written request, of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The source of the information,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The data used, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The calculation based upon the specified data,  if not contrary to domestic law regarding disclosure of information.
