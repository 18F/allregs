                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination of assistance. The recipient may terminate  assistance to a participant who violates program requirements or  conditions of occupancy. Recipients must exercise judgment and examine  all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations are serious  enough to warrant termination, so that a participant's assistance is  terminated only in the most severe cases. Recipients are not prohibited  from resuming assistance to a participant whose assistance has been  terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due process. In terminating assistance to a participant, the  recipient must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of  individuals receiving assistance to due process of law. This process, at  a minimum, must consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notice to the participant containing a clear statement  of the reasons for termination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the  opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other  than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved  the termination decision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prompt written notice of the final decision to the participant.</p>
