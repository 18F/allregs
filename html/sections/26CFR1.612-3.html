                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bonus. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a bonus in addition to royalties is received upon  the grant of an economic interest in a mineral deposit, or standing  timber, there shall be allowed to the payee as a cost depletion  deduction in respect of the bonus an amount equal to that proportion of  his basis for depletion as provided in section 612 and Sec. 1.612-1  which the amount of the bonus bears to the sum of the bonus and the  royalties expected to be received. Such allowance shall be deducted from  the payee's basis for depletion and the remainder of the basis is  recoverable through depletion deductions as the royalties are thereafter  received. (But see paragraph (e) of this section.) For example, a  taxpayer leases mineral property to another reserving a one-eighth  royalty and in addition receives a bonus of $10,000. Assuming that the  taxpayer's basis with respect to the mineral property is $21,000 and  that the royalties expected to be received are estimated to total  $20,000, the depletion on the bonus would be $7,000:  [$21,000 (basis)x$10,000 (bonus)]/$30,000 (bonus plus estimated  royalties).   The remaining $14,000 of basis will be recovered through depletion as  the royalties are received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the grant of an economic interest in a mineral deposit or  standing timber with respect to which a bonus was received expires,  terminates, or is abandoned before there has been any income derived  from the extraction of mineral or cutting of timber, the payee shall  adjust his capital account by restoring thereto the depletion deduction  taken on the bonus and a corresponding amount must be returned as income  in the year of such expiration, termination, or abandonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of the payor, payment of the bonus constitutes a  capital investment made for the acquisition of an economic interest in a  mineral deposit or standing timber recoverable through the depletion  allowance. See paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of Sec. 1.613-2 in cases in which  percentage depletion is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advanced royalties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the owner of an operating interest in  a mineral deposit or standing timber is required   to pay royalties on a specified number of units of such mineral or  timber annually whether or not extracted or cut within the year, and may  apply any amounts paid on account of units not extracted or cut within  the year against the royalty on the mineral or timber thereafter  extracted or cut, the payee shall compute cost depletion on the number  of units so paid for in advance of extraction or cutting and shall treat  the amount so determined as an allowable deduction for depletion from  the gross income of the year in which such payment or payments are made.  No deduction for depletion by such payee shall be claimed or allowed in  any subsequent year on account of the extraction or cutting in such year  of any mineral or timber so paid for in advance and for which deduction  has once been made. (But see paragraph (e) of this section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the right to extract minerals or to cut timber against which  the advanced royalties may be applied expires, terminates, or is  abandoned before all such minerals or timber have been extracted or cut,  the payee shall adjust his capital account by restoring thereto the  depletion deductions made in prior years on account of any units of  mineral or timber paid for in advance but not extracted or cut, and a  corresponding amount must be returned as income for the year of such  expiration, termination or abandonment. (But see paragraph (e) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of Sec. 1.631-3. Every taxpayer  who pays or accrues advanced royalties resulting from a minimum royalty  provision must make an election as to the treatment of all such advanced  royalties in his return for the first taxable year ending after December  31, 1939, in which the advanced royalties are paid or accrued. The  taxpayer's treatment of the advanced royalties for the first year shall  be deemed to be the exercise of the election. Accordingly, a failure to  deduct the advanced royalties for that year will constitute an election  to have all the advanced royalties treated as deductions for the year of  the sale of the mineral product in respect of which the advanced  royalties are paid or accrued. See section 7807(b)(2). For additional  rules relating to elections in the case of partners and partnerships,  see section 703(b) and the regulations thereunder. the provisions of  this subparagraph do not allow as deductions from gross income amounts  disallowed as deductions under other provisions of the Code, such as  section 461 (relating to general rule for taxable year of deduction),  section 465 (relating to deductions limited to amount at risk in case of  certain activities), or section 704(d) (relating to limitation on  allowance to partners of partnership losses).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The application of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. B leased certain mineral lands from A under a lease in  which A reserved a royalty of 10 cents a ton on minerals mined and sold  by B. The lease also provided that B   had to pay an annual minimum royalty of $10,000 representing the amount  due on 100,000 tons of the particular mineral whether or not B mined and  sold that amount. It was further provided that, if B did not mine and  sell 100,000 tons in any year, he could mine and sell in any subsequent  year the amount of mineral on which he had paid the royalty without the  payment of any additional royalty. However, this right of recoupment was  limited to minerals mined and sold in any later year in excess of the  100,000 tons represented by the $10,000 minimum royalty required to be  paid for that later year. Assume that in 1956 B paid A the minimum  royalty of $10,000, but mined and sold only 60,000 tons of the mineral  and that in 1957 he abandoned the lease without any further production.  Since the $10,000 represents royalties on 100,000 tons of mineral and  only 60,000 tons were mined and sold, A must restore in 1957 to his  capital account the depletion deductions taken in 1956 on $4,000 on  account of the 40,000 tons paid for in advance but not mined and sold,  and must also return the corresponding amount as income in 1957.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume that B, under the lease in example 1, paid the  $10,000 minimum royalty and mined no minerals in 1956 but that in 1957 B  mined and sold 200,000 tons of mineral. If this is B's first such  expenditure, B has an option, for the purpose of computing taxable  income under section 63, to deduct in 1956 the $10,000 paid in that year  although no mineral was mined, or to take the deduction in 1957 when the  mineral, for which the $10,000 was paid in 1956, was mined and sold.  (For treatment under percentage depletion, see example in paragraph  (c)(5)(iii) of Sec. 1.613-2.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delay rental. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A delay rental is an amount paid for the  privilege of deferring development of the property and which could have  been avoided by abandonment of the lease, or by commencement of  development operations, or by obtaining production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Since a delay rental is in the nature of rent it is ordinary  income to the payee and not subject to depletion. The payor may at his  election deduct such amount as an expense, or under section 266 and the  regulations thereunder, charge it to depletable capital account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Percentage depletion deduction with respect to bonus and  advanced royalty. In lieu of the allowance based on cost depletion  computed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the payees  referred to therein may be allowed a depletion deduction in respect of  any bonus or advanced royalty for the taxable year in an amount computed  on the basis of the percentage of gross income from the property as  provided in section 613 and the regulations thereunder. However, for  special rules applicable to certain bonuses and advanced royalties  received in connection with oil or gas properties, see paragraph (j) of  Sec. 1.613A-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cross reference. In the case of bonuses and advanced royalties  received in connection with a contract of disposal of timber covered by  section 631(b) or coal or iron ore covered by section 631(c), see that  section and the regulations thereunder.
