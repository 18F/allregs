That Act also mandates rounding of the adjustment, depending on the amount of the maximum penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ratio of the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding this adjustment to the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the amount of civil monetary penalties provided for under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 3801-3812) and the false claims provisions at 31 U.S.C. 3729(a) was last set or adjusted, 1986, is 456.7/327.9, which produces the following increases in the penalties after applicable rounding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum penalty under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act for a false claim or statement would be increased from $5,000 to $7,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum and minimum penalties under the false claims provisions at 31 U.S.C. 3729(a) would be increased from $10,000 to $14,000 and $5,000 to $7,000, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Imposition of the increases are limited to actions occurring after the effective date of the increases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No increase may exceed ten percent of the penalty or range of penalties, as applicable.</p>
