                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under Sec. 225.36,  violations of the terms and conditions of any minerals agreement, the  regulations in this part, other applicable laws or regulations, or  failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a cessation order  issued by the Secretary may subject an operator to a penalty of not more  than $1,000 per day for each day that such a violation or noncompliance  continues beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the operator  either personally or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's  last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be  deemed to be the date received or five (5) working days after the date  mailed, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the  proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the operator of the  operator's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days of  receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be  held before the Superintendent or Area Director whose findings shall be  conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2. If  within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of proposed penalty the  operator has not requested a hearing or paid the amount of the proposed  penalty, a final notice of penalty shall be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the person served with a notice of proposed penalty requests  a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or  noncompliance set forth in   the notice continue beyond the time limits presented for corrective  action. The Secretary may issue a written suspension of the requirement  to correct the violations pending completion of the hearings provided by  this section only upon a determination, at the discretion of the  Secretary, that such a suspension will not be detrimental to the Indian  mineral owner and upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed  adequate to indemnify the Indian mineral owner from loss or damage. The  amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting  the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus  accrued penalties and interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment of penalties in full more than ten (10) days after a  final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the operator to late  payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis  of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each  month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In  the absence of a specific minerals agreement provision prescribing a  different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments  shall be a rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of  payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is  late.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the  Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official  to impose penalties under applicable statutory or regulatory  authorities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Replacing, superseding, or replicating any penalty provision in  the terms and conditions of a minerals agreement approved by the  Secretary pursuant to this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of  minerals agreement provisions for which the Authorized Officer,  Director's Representative, or MMS Official has either statutory or  regulatory authority to assess a penalty.</p>
