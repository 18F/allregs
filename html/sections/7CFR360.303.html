                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator will approve or deny an application for a permit  to move a noxious weed. If the application is approved, the  Administrator will issue the permit including any conditions that the  Administrator has determined are necessary to prevent dissemination of  noxious weeds into the United States or interstate. Such conditions may  include requirements for inspection of the premises where the noxious  weed is to be handled after its movement under the permit, to determine  whether the facilities there are adequate to prevent noxious weed  dissemination and whether the conditions of the permit are otherwise  being observed. Before the permit is issued, the Administrator will  require the responsible person to agree in writing to the conditions  under which the noxious weed will be safeguarded.
