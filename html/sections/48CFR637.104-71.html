                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies only to personal services  agreements (PSAs) awarded under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. ``Personal Services Agreement (PSA)'' is a method of  employment using the statutory authority under 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). The  Procurement Executive has delegated program management responsibility  for PSAs awarded under the Department of State basic authority at 22  U.S.C. 2669(c). When applied to U.S. citizens hired under this  authority, the term ``PSA Plus'' is normally used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Policy. DOS contracting officers at overseas posts should not  award any personal services contracts that are subject to acquisition  statutes and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal  Years 1994 and 1995, amended section 2(c) of the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2669(c)) by revising the Department's  authority. This language states: ``and such contracts are authorized to  be negotiated, the terms of the contracts to be prescribed, and the work  to be performed, where necessary, without regard to such statutory  provisions as relative to the negotiation, making, and performance of  contracts and performance of work in the United States.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This authority was further amended under the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002   which added subsection (n) to 22 U.S.C. 2669. This language states  ``exercise the authority provided in section (c), upon the request of  the Secretary of Defense or the head of any other department or agency  of the United States, to enter into personal services contracts with  individuals to perform services in support of the Department of Defense  or such other department or agency, as the case may be.'' This authority  allowed the use of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) by all other agencies, provided  they meet certain criteria and agree to follow certain guidelines laid  out in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). That MOA is not signed at the  post level, but by a senior official at the Department of State and the  other agency. Without the MOA in place, other agencies may not use this  basic authority. HR/OE has responsibility for implementation of the  authority that came with this legislative change. The HR/OE Web site  includes the latest listing of agencies that have signed the MOA and can  use this authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This statutory language has continuing effect and provides  authority to the Department of State, and now other agencies, if they so  agree, to obtain personal services without adherence to acquisition  statutes. In furtherance of the authority provided by the statute, the  Procurement Executive has waived the applicability of acquisition  regulations when obtaining personal services under the authority of 22  U.S.C. 2669(c). As a result, it is not necessary for the individual  executing a PSA under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) to have a  contracting officer's certificate of appointment required under FAR  1.603 and 601.603 (see 601.603-3(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Signatory authority. Only direct hire U.S. citizens may sign  PSAs. Provided the individual meets that criterion, individuals who may  sign PSAs are limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Human Resources Officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Human Resources/Financial Management Officer; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Management Officer or American FSO designated to perform  human resources functions (e.g., GSO, RSO, etc.).
