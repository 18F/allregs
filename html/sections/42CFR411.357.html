The master list must be maintained in a manner that preserves the historical record of contracts. A physician or family member can ``furnish'' services through employees whom they have hired for the purpose of performing the services; through a wholly-owned entity; or through locum tenens physicians (as defined at Sec. 411.351, except that the regular physician need not be a member of a group practice).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The aggregate services contracted for do not exceed those that are reasonable and necessary for the legitimate business purposes of the arrangement(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term of each arrangement is for at least 1 year.

In the case of a physician incentive plan (as defined at Sec. 411.351) between a physician and an entity (or downstream contractor), the compensation may be determined in a manner (through a withhold, capitation, bonus, or otherwise) that takes into account directly or indirectly the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties, if the plan meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No specific payment is made directly or indirectly under the plan to a physician or a physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished with respect to a specific individual enrolled with the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon request of the Secretary, the entity provides the Secretary with access to information regarding the plan (including any downstream contractor plans), in order to permit the Secretary to determine whether the plan is in compliance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a plan that places a physician or a physician group at substantial financial risk as defined at Sec. 422.208, the entity or any downstream contractor (or both) complies with the requirements concerning physician incentive plans set forth in Sec. 422.208 and Sec. 422.210 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Physician recruitment.

In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined at Sec. 411.351), the ``geographic area served by the hospital'' may also be the area composed of the lowest number of contiguous zip codes from which the hospital draws at least 90 percent of its inpatients. If the hospital draws fewer than 90 percent of its inpatients from all of the contiguous zip codes from which it draws inpatients, the ``geographic area served by the hospital'' may include noncontiguous zip codes, beginning with the noncontiguous zip code in which the highest percentage of the hospital's inpatients resides, and continuing to add noncontiguous zip codes in decreasing order of percentage of inpatients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A physician will be considered to have relocated his or her medical practice if the medical practice was located outside the geographic area served by the hospital and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The physician moves his or her medical practice at least 25 miles and into the geographic area served by the hospital; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The physician moves his medical practice into the geographic area served by the hospital, and the physician's new medical practice derives at least 75 percent of its revenues from professional services furnished to patients (including hospital inpatients) not seen or treated by the physician at his or her prior medical practice site during the preceding 3 years, measured on an annual basis (fiscal or calendar year). For the initial ``start up'' year of the recruited physician's practice, the 75 percent test in the preceding sentence will be satisfied if there is a reasonable expectation that the recruited

physician's medical practice for the year will derive at least 75 percent of its revenues from professional services furnished to patients not seen or treated by the physician at his or her prior medical practice site during the preceding 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The recruited physician will not be subject to the relocation requirement of this paragraph, provided that he or she establishes his or her medical practice in the geographic area served by the recruiting hospital, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> He or she is a resident or physician who has been in practice 1 year or less;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> He or she was employed on a full-time basis for at least 2 years immediately prior to the recruitment arrangement by one of the following (and did not maintain a private practice in addition to such full-time employment):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A Federal or State bureau of prisons (or similar entity operating one or more correctional facilities) to serve a prison population;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs to serve active or veteran military personnel and their families; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A facility of the Indian Health Service to serve patients who receive medical care exclusively through the Indian Health Service; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary has deemed in an advisory opinion issued under section 1877(g) of the Act that the physician does not have an established medical practice that serves or could serve a significant number of patients who are or could become patients of the recruiting hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the case of remuneration provided by a hospital to a physician either indirectly through payments made to another physician practice, or directly to a physician who joins a physician practice, the following additional conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The written agreement in paragraph (e)(1) is also signed by the physician practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except for actual costs incurred by the physician practice in recruiting the new physician, the remuneration is passed directly through to or remains with the recruited physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an income guarantee of any type made by the hospital to a recruited physician who joins a physician practice, the costs allocated by the physician practice to the recruited physician do not exceed the actual additional incremental costs attributable to the recruited physician. With respect to a physician recruited to join a physician practice located in a rural area or HPSA, if the physician is recruited to replace a physician who, within the previous 12-month period, retired, relocated outside of the geographic area served by the hospital, or died, the costs allocated by the physician practice to the recruited physician do not exceed either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The actual additional incremental costs attributable to the recruited physician; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The lower of a per capita allocation or 20 percent of the practice's aggregate costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Records of the actual costs and the passed-through amounts are maintained for a period of at least 5 years and made available to the Secretary upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The remuneration from the hospital under the arrangement is not determined in a manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any actual or anticipated referrals by the recruited physician or the physician practice (or any physician affiliated with the physician practice) receiving the direct payments from the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The physician practice may not impose on the recruited physician practice restrictions that unreasonably restrict the recruited physician's ability to practice medicine in the geographic area served by the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recruitment of a physician by a hospital located in a rural area (as defined at Sec. 411.351) to an area outside the geographic area served by the hospital is permitted under this exception if the Secretary determines in an advisory opinion issued under section 1877(g) of

the Act that the area has a demonstrated need for the recruited physician and all other requirements of this paragraph (e) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> This paragraph (e) applies to remuneration provided by a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic in the same manner as it applies to remuneration provided by a hospital, provided that the arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Isolated transactions. Isolated financial transactions, such as a one-time sale of property or a practice, if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of remuneration under the isolated transaction is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistent with the fair market value of the transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not determined in a manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any referrals by the referring physician or other business generated between the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The remuneration is provided under an agreement that would be commercially reasonable even if the physician made no referrals to the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There are no additional transactions between the parties for 6 months after the isolated transaction, except for transactions that are specifically excepted under the other provisions in Sec. 411.355 through Sec. 411.357 and except for commercially reasonable post-closing adjustments that do not take into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Certain arrangements with hospitals. Remuneration provided by a hospital to a physician if the remuneration does not relate, directly or indirectly, to the furnishing of DHS. To qualify as ``unrelated,'' remuneration must be wholly unrelated to the furnishing of DHS and must not in any way take into account the volume or value of a physician's referrals. Remuneration relates to the furnishing of DHS if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is an item, service, or cost that could be allocated in whole or in part to Medicare or Medicaid under cost reporting principles;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is furnished, directly or indirectly, explicitly or implicitly, in a selective, targeted, preferential, or conditioned manner to medical staff or other persons in a position to make or influence referrals; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Otherwise takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Group practice arrangements with a hospital.

Payments made by a physician (or his or her immediate family member)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To a laboratory in exchange for the provision of clinical laboratory services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To an entity as compensation for any other items or services that are

furnished at a price that is consistent with fair market value, and that are not specifically excepted by another provision in Sec. Sec. 411.355 through 411.357 (including, but not limited to, Sec. 411.357(l)). ``Services'' in this context means services of any kind (not merely those defined as ``services'' for purposes of the Medicare program in Sec. 400.202 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Charitable donations by a physician. Bona fide charitable donations made by a physician (or immediate family member) to an entity if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The charitable donation is made to an organization exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code (or to a supporting organization);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The donation is neither solicited, nor offered, in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the physician and the entity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The donation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Nonmonetary compensation. (1) Compensation from an entity in the form of items or services (not including cash or cash equivalents) that does not exceed an aggregate of $300 per calendar year, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation from an entity in the form of items or services (not including cash or cash equivalents) that does not exceed an aggregate of $300 per calendar year, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The compensation is not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The compensation may not be solicited by the physician or the physician's practice (including employees and staff members).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The compensation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act) or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The annual aggregate nonmonetary compensation limit in this paragraph (k) is adjusted each calendar year to the nearest whole dollar by the increase in the Consumer Price Index--Urban All Items (CPI-U) for the 12-month period ending the preceding September 30. CMS displays after September 30 each year both the increase in the CPI-U for the 12-month period and the new nonmonetary compensation limit on the physician self-referral Web site: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianSelfReferral/10--CPI-U--Updates.asp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where an entity has inadvertently provided nonmonetary compensation to a physician in excess of the limit (as set forth in paragraph (k)(1) of this section), such compensation is deemed to be within the limit if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The value of the excess nonmonetary compensation is no more than 50 percent of the limit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The physician returns to the entity the excess nonmonetary compensation (or an amount equal to the value of the excess nonmonetary compensation) by the end of the calendar year in which the excess nonmonetary compensation was received or within 180 consecutive calendar days following the date the excess nonmonetary compensation was received by the physician, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (k)(3) may be used by an entity only once every 3 years with respect to the same referring physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In addition to nonmonetary compensation up to the limit described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, an entity that has a formal medical staff may provide one local medical staff appreciation event per year for the entire medical staff.

Compensation resulting from an arrangement between an entity and a physician (or an immediate family member) or any group of physicians (regardless of whether the group meets the definition of a group practice set forth in Sec. 411.352) for the provision of items or services (other than the rental of office space) by the physician (or an immediate family member) or group of physicians to the entity, or by the entity to the physician (or an immediate family member) or a group of physicians, if the arrangement is set forth in

The compensation must be set in advance, consistent with fair market value, and not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician. Compensation for the rental of equipment may not be determined using a formula based on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A percentage of the revenue raised, earned, billed, collected, or otherwise attributable to the services performed or business generated through the use of the equipment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Per-unit of service rental charges, to the extent that such charges reflect services provided to patients referred by the lessor to the lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The arrangement is commercially reasonable (taking into account the nature and scope of the transaction) and furthers the legitimate business purposes of the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The services to be performed under the arrangement do not involve the counseling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity that violates a Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Medical staff incidental benefits.
