                            <p class="depth0">GSA may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to  withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 105-057.006 and 105-57.008 of this part, plus attorney's  fees, costs, and if applicable, punitive damages. However, a suit may  not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a  particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid  expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes  of this part, ``termination of the collection action'' occurs when GSA  has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other  applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action  will have been deemed to occur if GSA has not received any payments to  satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to  garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.</p>
