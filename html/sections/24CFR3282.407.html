                            <p class="depth0">A manufacturer that takes corrective action that complies with one  of the following three alternatives to the requirement in Sec. 3282.408  for preparing a plan will be deemed to have provided any notification  required by Sec. 3282.405:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary action--one home. When a manufacturer has made a  determination that only one manufactured home is involved, the  manufacturer is not required to provide notification pursuant to Sec.  3282.405 or to prepare or submit a plan if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer has made a determination of defect; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer has made a determination of serious defect or  imminent safety hazard and corrects the home within the 20-day period.  The manufacturer must maintain, in the plant where the manufactured home  was manufactured, a complete record of the correction. The record must  describe briefly the facts of the case and any known cause of the  serious defect or imminent safety hazard, state what corrective actions  were taken, and be maintained in the service records in a form that will  allow the Secretary or an SAA to review all such corrections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary action--multiple homes. Regardless of whether a plan  has been submitted under Sec. 3282.408, the manufacturer may act prior  to obtaining approval of the plan. Such action is subject to review and  disapproval by the SAA of the state where the home was manufactured or  by the Secretary, unless the manufacturer obtains the written agreement  of the SAA or the Secretary that the corrective action is adequate. If  such an agreement is obtained, the correction must be accepted as  adequate by all SAAs and the Secretary, if the manufacturer makes the  correction as agreed to and any imminent safety hazard or serious defect  is eliminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may obtain a waiver of the  notification requirements in Sec. 3282.405 and the plan requirements in  Sec. 3282.408 either from the SAA of the state of manufacture, when all  of the manufactured homes that would be covered by the plan were  manufactured in that state, or from the Secretary. As of the date of a  request for a waiver, the notification and plan requirements are  deferred pending timely submission of any additional documentation as  the SAA or the Secretary may require and final resolution of the waiver  request. If a waiver request is not granted, the plan required by Sec.  3282.408 must be submitted within 5 days after the expiration of the  time frame established in Sec. 3282.408, if the manufacturer is  notified that the request was not granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The waiver may be approved if, not later than 20 days after  making the determination that notification is required, the manufacturer  presents evidence that it, in good faith, believes would show to the  satisfaction of the SAA or the Secretary that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer has identified all homes that would be covered  by the plan in accordance with Sec. 3282.408;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer will correct, at its expense, all of the  identified homes, either within 60 days of being informed that the  request for waiver has been granted or within another time limit  approved in the waiver;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed repairs are adequate to remove the defect,  serious defect, or imminent safety hazard that gave rise to the  determination that correction is required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer must correct all affected manufactured homes  within 60 days of being informed that the request for waiver has been  granted or within the time limit approved in the waiver, as applicable.  The manufacturer must record the known cause of the problem and the  correction in the service records, in an approved form   that will allow the Secretary or SAA to review the cause and correction.</p>
