                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Earth station license modifications, notification required. Authorized earth station operators may make the following modifications to their licenses without prior Commission authorization, provided that the operators notify the Commission, using FCC Form 312 and Schedule B, within 30 days of the modification. This notification must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensees may make changes to their authorized earth stations without obtaining prior Commission authorization, provided that they have complied with all applicable frequency coordination procedures in accordance with Sec. 25.251, and the modification does not involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An increase in EIRP or EIRP density (both main lobe and side lobe);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An increase in transmitted power;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A change in coordinates of more than 1 second in latitude or longitude for stations operating in frequency bands that are shared with terrestrial systems; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A change in coordinates of 10 seconds or greater in latitude or longitude for stations operating in frequency bands that are not shared with terrestrial systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for replacement of equipment where the new equipment is electrically identical to the existing equipment, an authorized earth station licensee may add, change or replace transmitters or antenna facilities without prior authorization, provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The added, changed, or replaced facilities conform to any applicable requirements in Sec. 25.209;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The particulars of operations remain unchanged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Frequency coordination is not required; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The maximum power and power density delivered into any antenna at the earth station site shall not exceed the values calculated by subtracting the maximum antenna gain specified in the license from the maximum authorized e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized VSAT earth station operators may add VSAT remote terminals without prior authorization, provided that they have complied with all applicable frequency coordination procedures in accordance with Sec. 25.251.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A licensee providing service on a private carrier basis may change its operations to common carrier status without obtaining prior Commission authorization. The licensee must notify the Commission using Form 312 within 30 days after the completed change to common carrier status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Earth station operators may change their points of communication without prior authorization, provided that the change results from a space station license modification described in paragraph (e) of this section, and the earth station operator does not repoint its antenna. Otherwise, any modification of an earth station license to add or change a point of communication will be considered under Sec. 25.117.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Earth station license modifications, notification not required. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, equipment in an authorized earth station may be replaced without prior authorization and without notifying the Commission if the new equipment is electrically identical to the existing equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)-(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relocation of GSO space stations. A space station operator may modify its license without prior authorization, but upon 30 days prior notice to the Commission and any potentially affected licensed spectrum user, provided that the operator meets the following requirements. This notification must be filed electronically on Form 312 through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The space station licensee will relocate a Geostationary Satellite Orbit (GSO) space station to another orbit location that is assigned to that licensee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relocated space station licensee will operate with the same technical parameters as the space station initially assigned to that location, or within the original satellite's authorized and/or coordinated parameters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The space station licensee certifies that it will comply with all the conditions of its original license and all applicable rules after the relocation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The space station licensee certifies that it will comply with all applicable coordination agreements at the newly occupied orbital location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The space station licensee certifies that it has completed any necessary coordination of its space station at the new location with other potentially affected space station operators, including coordination of station-keeping volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The space station licensee certifies that it will limit operations of the space station to Tracking, Telemetry, and Control (TT&C;) functions during the relocation and satellite drift transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The space station licensee certifies that the relocation of the space station does not result in a lapse of service for any current customer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A DBS space station licensee must certify that there will be no increase in interference due to the operations of the relocated space station that would require the Commission to submit a proposed modification to the ITU Appendix 30 Broadcasting-Satellite Service (``BSS'') Plan and/or the Appendix 30A feeder link Plan to the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For DBS licensees, the space station licensee must certify that it will

meet the geographic service requirements in Sec. 25.148(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Repositioning of NGSO space stations. A licensee may reposition NGSO space stations within an authorized orbital plane without prior Commission approval, provided the licensee notifies the Commission of the repositioning 10 days in advance by electronic filing on Form 312 in the International Bureau Filing System. The notification must specify all changes in previously authorized parameters and must certify the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The licensee will continue to comply with the conditions of the space station license and all applicable Commission rules, including geographic coverage requirements, after the repositioning;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The repositioning will not increase risk of harmful interference to other systems not permitted by coordination agreements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee will not request increased interference protection because of the repositioning;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The licensee will monitor collision risk during the maneuver and take any necessary evasive measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any change of orbital altitude entailed by the repositioning will not exceed 10 kilometers in extent or 30 days in duration and the licensee has notified, or will notify, the operator(s) of any satellite within 20 kilometers of the interim orbit at least 10 days before commencing the repositioning maneuver.
