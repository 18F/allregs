                            <p class="depth0">The following are definitions of terms used in this part. Grants  officers are cautioned that terms may be defined differently in this  part than they are in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement  Regulations, because this part implements OMB Circular A-110 and uses  definitions as stated in that Circular. In such cases, the definition  given in this section applies to the term as it is used in this part,  and the definition given in other parts applies to the term as it is  used in those parts. For example, ``suspension'' is defined in this  section to mean temporary withdrawal of Federal sponsorship under an  award, but is defined in the part of the DoD Grant and Agreement  Regulations on nonprocurement suspension and debarment (2 CFR part 1125,  which implements OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180) to be an action taken  to exclude a person from participating in a grant, cooperative  agreement, or other covered transaction (see definition at 2 CFR  180.1015).</p><p class="depth0">Accrued expenditures.
