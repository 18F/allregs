                                Sec. 405.534  Limitation on payment for screening mammography
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply  for services provided from January 1, 1991 until December 31, 2001.  Screening mammography services provided after December 31, 2001 are paid  under the physician fee schedule in accordance with Sec. 414.2 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis and scope. This section implements section 1834(c) of the  Act by establishing a limit on payment for screening mammography  examinations. There are three categories of billing for screening  mammography services. Those categories and the payment limitations on  each are set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Global or complete service billing representing both the  professional and technical components of the procedure. If a fee is  billed for a global service, the amount of payment subject to the  deductible is equal to 80 percent of the least of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actual charge for the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount established for the global procedure for a diagnostic  bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians' services set  forth at part 414, subpart A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The payment limit for the procedure. For screening mammography  services furnished in CY 1994, the payment limit is $59.63. On January 1  of each subsequent year, the payment limit is updated by the percentage  increase in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) and reflects the  relationship between the relative value units for the professional and  technical components of a diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee  schedule for physicians' services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Professional component billing representing only the physician's  interpretation for the procedure. If the professional component of  screening mammography services is billed separately, the amount of  payment for that professional component, subject to the deductible, is  equal to 80 percent of the least of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actual charge for the professional component of the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount established for the professional component of a  diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians'  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Technical component billing representing other resources  involved in furnishing the procedure. If the technical component of  screening mammography services is billed separately, the amount of  payment, subject to the deductible, is equal to 80 percent of the least  of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actual charge for the technical component of the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount established for the technical component of a  diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians'  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.  [55 FR 53521, Dec. 31, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 49833, Sept. 30, 1994;  66 FR 55328, Nov. 1, 2001]</p>
