any proprietary data or personal information it collects or receives, from or on behalf of any person, for the purpose of fulfilling its regulatory obligations; provided, however, that a swap execution facility may use such data or information for business or marketing purposes if the person from whom it collects or receives such data or information clearly consents to the swap execution facility's use of such data or information in such manner. A swap execution facility shall not condition access to its market(s) or market services on a person's consent to the swap execution facility's use of proprietary data or personal information for business or marketing purposes. A swap execution facility, where necessary for regulatory purposes, may share such data or information with one or more swap execution facilities or designated contract markets registered with the Commission.</p>
