Investigation</p><p class="depth0">1. If the investigating official concludes that a subpoena pursuant to the authority conferred by 31 U.S.C. 3804(a) is warranted, then:</p><p class="depth0">a. The subpoena so issued shall notify the person to whom it is addressed of the authority under which the subpoena is issued and shall identify the records or documents sought;</p><p class="depth0">b. The investigating official may designate a person to act on his or her behalf to receive the documents sought; and</p><p class="depth0">c.

If the investigating official concludes that an action under the PFCRA may be warranted, the investigating official shall submit a report containing the findings and

conclusions of such investigation to the appropriate reviewing official(s). In instances where the false claim or false statement involves more than one authority within the Department of Defense, or where the investigating official finds that more than one case has arisen from the same set of facts, the investigating official may, at his or her sole discretion, refer the case(s) to the reviewing official of one of the affected authorities. That reviewing official shall consolidate the claims and statements and act for all. Nothing in this subsection confers any right in any party to the consolidation or severance of any case(s), although presiding officers may, at their sole discretion, entertain motions to consolidate or sever.</p><p class="depth0">3. Nothing in this section shall preclude or limit an investigating official's discretion to refer allegations directly to the Department of Justice for suit under 18 U.S.C. 287 or 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 3730, False Claims Act, or other civil relief, or to preclude or limit such official's discretion to defer or postpone a report or referral to the reviewing official to avoid interference with a criminal investigation or prosecution.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nothing in this section modifies any responsibility of an investigating official to report violations of criminal law to the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth0">5. Nothing in this section shall preclude or limit the investigating official's authority to obtain the assistance of any investigative units of the Department of Defense, including those of the Military Departments. In this regard, appropriate investigation may be conducted by the Defense criminal investigative organizations and other investigative elements of the Military Departments and Defense Agencies.</p><p class="depth0">E. Review by the Reviewing Official</p><p class="depth0">1. If, based on the report of the investigating official under subsection D.2., above, the reviewing official determines that there is adequate evidence to believe that a person is liable under section C., above, the reviewing official shall transmit to the Attorney General or his or her designated point of coordination within the Department of Justice a written notice of the reviewing official's intention to issue a complaint under section G., below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Such notice shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. A statement of the reviewing official's reasons for issuing a complaint;</p><p class="depth0">b. A statement specifying the evidence that supports the allegations of liability;</p><p class="depth0">c. A description of the claims or statements upon which the allegations of liability are based;</p><p class="depth0">d. An estimate of the amount of money or the value of property, services, or other benefits requested or demanded in violation of section C., above.</p><p class="depth0">e. A statement of any exculpatory or mitigating circumstances that may relate to the claims or statements known by the reviewing official or the investigating official; and</p><p class="depth0">f. A statement that there is a reasonable prospect of collecting an appropriate amount of penalties and assessments.</p><p class="depth0">F. Prerequisites for Issuing a Complaint</p><p class="depth0">1. The reviewing official may issue a complaint under section G., below, only if:</p><p class="depth0">a. The Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint in a written statement described in 31 U.S.C. 3803(b)(1); and</p><p class="depth0">b. In the case of allegations of liability under subsection C.1., above, with respect to a claim, the reviewing official determines that, with respect to such claim or a group of related claims submitted at the same time such claim is submitted (as defined in subsection 2. of this section), the amount of money or the value of property or services demanded or requested in violation of subsection C.1., above, does not exceed $150,000.00;</p><p class="depth0">2. For the purposes of this section, a related group of claims submitted at the same time shall include only those claims arising from the same transaction (e.g., grant, loan, application, or contract) that are submitted simultaneously as part of a single request, demand, or submission.</p><p class="depth0">3. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the reviewing official's authority to join in a single complaint against a person's claims that are unrelated or were not submitted simultaneously, regardless of the amount of money or the value of property or services demanded or requested.</p><p class="depth0">4. In any case that involves claims or statements made to more than one entity within the Department of Defense or the Military Departments, or the reviewing officials having responsibility for each such entity, as stated in subsection D.2., above, shall have concurrent jurisdiction to make the required determinations under this section. In any such case, the responsible reviewing officials shall coordinate with each other prior to making any determination under this section. Where more than one case arises from the same set of facts, such cases shall be consolidated to the degree practicable, although the reviewing official shall have absolute discretion to make such determination. The requirements of this paragraph do not confer any procedural or substantive rights upon individuals, associations, corporations, or other persons or entities who might become defendants under the PFCRA.</p><p class="depth0">G. Complaint</p><p class="depth0">1. On or after the date the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3803(b)(1), the reviewing official may serve a complaint on the defendant, as provided in section H., below.</p><p class="depth0">2. The complaint shall state the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. The allegations of liability against the defendant, including the statutory basis for liability, an identification of the claims or statements that are the basis for the alleged liability, and the reasons why liability allegedly arises from such claims or statements;</p><p class="depth0">b. The maximum amount of penalties and assessments for which the defendant may be held liable;</p><p class="depth0">c. Instructions for filing an answer to a request including a specific statement of the defendant's right to request a hearing, by filing an answer and to be represented by a representative; and</p><p class="depth0">d. That failure to file an answer within 30 days of service of the complaint shall result in the imposition of penalties and assessments without right to appeal, consistent with the provisions of section J., below.</p><p class="depth0">3. At the same time the reviewing official serves the complaint, he or she shall notify the defendant with a copy of this part and any applicable implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">H. Service of Complaint</p><p class="depth0">1. Service of a complaint must be made by certified or registered mail or by delivery in any manner authorized by Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service is complete upon receipt.</p><p class="depth0">2. Proof of service, stating the name and address of the person on whom the complaint was served, and the manner and date of service may be made by the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Affidavit of the individual serving the complaint by delivery;</p><p class="depth0">b. A United States Postal Service return receipt card acknowledging receipt; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Written acknowledgement of receipt by the defendant or his or her representative.</p><p class="depth0">I. Answer</p><p class="depth0">1. The defendant may request a hearing by filing an answer with the reviewing official within 30 days of service of the complaint. An answer shall be deemed to be a request for hearing.</p><p class="depth0">2. In the answer, the defendant:</p><p class="depth0">a. Shall admit or deny each of the allegations of liability made in the complaint;</p><p class="depth0">b. Shall state any defense on which the defendant intends to rely;</p><p class="depth0">c. May state any reasons why the defendant contends that the penalties and assessments should be less than the statutory maximum; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Shall state the name, address, and telephone number of the person authorized by the defendant to act as defendant's representative, if any.</p><p class="depth0">3. If the defendant is unable to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.b of this section within the time provided, the defendant may, before the expiration of 30 days from service of the complaint, file with the reviewing official a general answer denying liability and requesting a hearing, and a request for an extension of time within which to file an answer meeting the requirements of subsection 2. of this section. The reviewing official shall, in such event, file promptly with the presiding officer the complaint, the general answer denying liability, and the request for an extension of time as provided in section K., below. For good cause shown, the presiding officer may grant the defendant additional time within which to file an answer meeting the requirements of subsection 2. of this section.</p><p class="depth0">4. The 30-day limitation for filing an answer may be tolled for a reasonable period of time by written agreement of the parties and approval of the authority head to allow time for settlement.</p><p class="depth0">J. Default Upon Failure To File an Answer</p><p class="depth0">1. If the defendant does not file an answer within the time prescribed in subsection I.1., above, and there is no approved written agreement as in subsection I.4, above, tolling the time prescribed, the reviewing official may then refer the complaint to the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Upon referral of the complaint pursuant to this section, the presiding officer shall promptly serve on defendant, in the manner prescribed in section H., above, a notice that an initial decision will be issued under this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. Upon referral of the complaint pursuant to this section, the presiding officer shall assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and, if such facts establish liability under section C., above, the presiding officer shall issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments under the statute.</p><p class="depth0">4. Except as otherwise provided in this section, by failing to file a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the penalties and assessments imposed under subsection 3. of this section, and the initial decision shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after it is issued.</p><p class="depth0">5. If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant files a motion with the presiding officer seeking to reopen on the grounds that good cause prevented the defendant from filing an answer, the initial decision shall be stayed pending the presiding officer's decision on the motion.</p><p class="depth0">6. If, on a motion brought under subsection J.5., above, the defendant can demonstrate good cause excusing the failure to file a

timely answer, the presiding officer shall withdraw the initial decision in subsection 3. of this section if such a decision has been issued, and shall grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.</p><p class="depth0">7. A decision of the presiding officer denying a defendant's motion under subsections 5. and 6. of this section is not subject to reconsideration under section LL., below.</p><p class="depth0">8. The defendant may appeal to the authority head the decision denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head within 15 days after the presiding officer denies the motion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal shall stay the initial decision until the authority head decides the issue.</p><p class="depth0">9. If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the authority head, the presiding officer shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head.</p><p class="depth0">10. The authority head shall decide expeditiously whether good cause excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer based solely on the record before the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">11. If the authority head decides that good cause excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall remand the case to the presiding officer with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.</p><p class="depth0">12. If the authority head decides that the defendant's failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall approve the initial decision of the presiding officer, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such decision.</p><p class="depth0">K. Referral of Complaint and Answer to the Presiding Officer</p><p class="depth0">1. Upon receipt of an answer, the reviewing official shall file the complaint and answer with the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Within 10 days of service, a party may file an opposition to the motion and/or a motion for protective order as provided in section X., below.</p><p class="depth0">c. The presiding officer may grant a motion of discovery only if he finds that the discovery sought:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is necessary for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not unduly costly or burdensome;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Will not unduly delay the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Does not seek privileged information.</p><p class="depth0">d.

Each party shall bear its own costs of discovery.</p><p class="depth0">V. Exchange of Witness Lists, Statements, and Exhibits</p><p class="depth0">1. At least 15 days before the hearing or at such other time as may be ordered by the presiding officer, the parties shall exchange witness lists, copies of prior statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements that the party intends to offer in lieu of live testimony in accordance with subsection GG.2., below. At the time the above documents are exchanged, any party that intends to rely upon the transcript of deposition testimony in lieu of live testimony at the hearing, if permitted by the presiding officer, shall provide each party with a copy of the specific pages of the transcript it intends to introduce into evidence.</p><p class="depth0">2. If a party objects, the presiding officer shall not admit into evidence the testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the witness list or any exhibit not provided to the opposing party as provided

above unless the presiding officer finds good cause for the failure or that there is no prejudice to the objecting party.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unless another party objects within the time set by the presiding officer, documents exchanged in accordance with subsection 1. of this section shall be admitted into evidence at the hearing. Later challenges to admissibility at the hearing shall be permitted only upon a showing of good cause for the lateness.</p><p class="depth0">W. Subpoenas for Attendance at Hearing</p><p class="depth0">1. A party wishing to procure the appearance and testimony of any individual at the hearing may request that the presiding officer issue a subpoena.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Such request shall specify any documents to be produced and shall designate the witnesses and describe the address and location thereof with sufficient particularity to permit such witnesses to be found.</p><p class="depth0">4. The subpoena shall specify the time and place at which the witness is to appear and any documents the witness is to produce.</p><p class="depth0">5. The party seeking the subpoena shall serve it in the manner prescribed in section H., above. A subpoena on a party or upon an individual under the control of a party may be served by first class mail.</p><p class="depth0">6. A party or a representative of the individual to whom the subpoena is directed may file with the presiding officer a motion to quash the subpoena with 10 days after service or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if it is less than 10 days after service.</p><p class="depth0">X. Protective Order</p><p class="depth0">1. A party or a prospective witness or deponent may file a motion for a protective order with respect to discovery sought by an opposing party or with respect to the hearing, seeking to limit the availability or disclosure of evidence.</p><p class="depth0">2. In issuing a protective order, the presiding officer may make any order that justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense including one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. That the discovery not be had;</p><p class="depth0">b. That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p><p class="depth0">c.

That the parties simultaneously file specified documents of information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">Y. Fees</p><p class="depth0">The party requesting a subpoena shall pay the cost of the witness fees and mileage of any witness subpoenaed in the amounts that would be payable to a witness in a proceeding in the United States District Court. A check for witness fees and mileage shall accompany the subpoena when served, except that when a subpoena is issued on behalf of the authority a check for witness fees and mileage need not accompany the subpoena.</p><p class="depth0">Z.

When a party is represented by a representative, service shall be made upon such representative in lieu of the actual party.</p><p class="depth0">3. Proof of service. A certificate of the individual serving the document by personal delivery or by mail, setting forth the manner of service, shall be proof of service.</p><p class="depth0">AA. Computation of Time</p><p class="depth0">1. In computing any period of time under this part or in an order issued thereunder, the time begins with the day following the act, event, or default, and includes the last day of the period, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday observed by the Federal Government, in which event it includes the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">2. When the period of time allowed is less than 7 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the Federal Government shall be excluded from the computation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Where a document has been served or issued by placing it in the mail, an additional 5 days will be added to the time permitted for any response.</p><p class="depth0">BB. Motions</p><p class="depth0">1. Any application to the presiding officer for an order or ruling shall be by motion. Motions shall state the relief sought, the authority relied upon, the facts alleged, and shall be filed with the presiding officer and served on all other parties.</p><p class="depth0">2.

The presiding officer may not grant a written motion before the time for filing responses thereto has expired, except upon consent of the parties or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny such motion without awaiting a response.</p><p class="depth0">5. The presiding officer shall make a reasonable effort to dispose of all outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0">6. Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to the beginning of the hearing shall constitute waiver thereof, but the presiding officer may grant relief from the waiver for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth0">CC. Sanctions</p><p class="depth0">1. The presiding officer may sanction a person, including any party or representative, for the following:</p><p class="depth0">a.

Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in subsections 3., 4., and 5. of this section, shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.</p><p class="depth0">3. When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for admission, the presiding officer may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;</p><p class="depth0">b. In the case of requests for admission, deem each matter of which an admission is requested to be admitted;</p><p class="depth0">c.

The presiding officer may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief, or other document that is not filed in a timely fashion.</p><p class="depth0">DD. The Hearing and Burden of Proof</p><p class="depth0">1.

The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Determining the Amount of Penalties and Assessments</p><p class="depth0">In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the presiding officer and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose.</p><p class="depth0">FF. Location of Hearing</p><p class="depth0">1. The hearing may be held as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. In any judicial district of the United States in which the defendant resides or transacts business;</p><p class="depth0">b.

Except as provided in subsection 2. of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth0">2. At the discretion of the presiding officer, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written or videotaped statement or deposition. Any such written or videotaped statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for deposition or cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written or videotaped statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearings and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in subsection V.1., above.</p><p class="depth0">3. The presiding officer shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:</p><p class="depth0">a. Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;</p><p class="depth0">b. Avoid needless consumption of time; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</p><p class="depth0">4. The presiding officer shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth0">5. At the discretion of the presiding officer, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination.</p><p class="depth0">6. Upon motion of any party, the presiding officer shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. A party who is an individual;</p><p class="depth0">b. In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party appearing for the party as its representative, or designated by the party's representative; or</p><p class="depth0">c. An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.</p><p class="depth0">HH. Evidence</p><p class="depth0">1. The presiding officer shall determine the admissibility of evidence.</p><p class="depth0">2. Except as provided herein, the presiding officer shall not be bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the presiding officer may apply the Federal Rules of Evidence where appropriate; e.g., to exclude unreliable evidence.</p><p class="depth0">3. The presiding officer shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.</p><p class="depth0">4. Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by consideration of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p><p class="depth0">5. Evidence shall be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law and the holder of the privilege asserts it.</p><p class="depth0">6. Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p><p class="depth0">7. The presiding officer shall permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.</p><p class="depth0">8. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer pursuant to section X., above.</p><p class="depth0">II. The Record and Finding</p><p class="depth0">1. The hearing will be recorded and transcribed. Transcripts may be obtained following the hearing from the presiding officer at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth0">2. The transcript of testimony, exhibits, and other evidence admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the proceeding constitute the record for the decision by the presiding officer and the authority head.</p><p class="depth0">3. The record may be inspected and copied (upon payment of a reasonable fee) by anyone, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">4. Funding for the hearing and record, except for the cost of the presiding officer, shall be the responsibility of the authority in which the case arose.</p><p class="depth0">JJ. Post-hearing Briefs</p><p class="depth0">The presiding officer may require or permit the parties to file post-hearing briefs. The presiding officer shall fix the time for filing any such briefs, not to exceed 60 days from the date the parties receive the transcript of the hearing or, if applicable, the stipulated record. Such briefs may be accompanied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The presiding officer may permit the parties to file reply briefs.</p><p class="depth0">KK. Initial Decision</p><p class="depth0">1. The presiding officer shall issue an initial decision based only on the record that shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties and assessments imposed.</p><p class="depth0">2. The findings of fact shall include a finding on each of the following issues:</p><p class="depth0">a. Whether the claims or statements identified in the complaint, or any portions thereof, violate section C., above; and</p><p class="depth0">b. If the person is liable for penalties or assessments, the appropriate amount of any such penalties or assessments.</p><p class="depth0">3. The presiding officer shall promptly serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired. The presiding officer shall at the same time serve all parties with a statement describing the right of any defendant determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a motion for reconsideration with the presiding officer or a notice of appeal with the authority head. If the presiding officer fails to meet the deadline contained in this subsection, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unless the initial decision of the presiding officer is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision of the presiding officer shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0">LL. Reconsideration of Initial Decision</p><p class="depth0">1. Except as provided in subsection 4. of this section, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision within 20 days of service of the initial decision in the manner set forth in section H., above, for service of the complaint. Service shall be proved in the manner provided in subsection H.2., above.</p><p class="depth0">2. Every such motion must set forth the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the nature of the alleged errors. Such motion shall be accompanied by a supporting brief.</p><p class="depth0">3. Responses to such motions shall be allowed only upon request of the presiding officer; however, the presiding officer shall not issue a revised initial determination without affording both parties an opportunity to be heard on the motion for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth0">4. No party may file a motion for reconsideration of an initial decision that has been revised in response to a previous motion for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth0">5.
