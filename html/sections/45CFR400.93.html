                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State must provide any individual wishing to do so an  opportunity to apply for medical assistance and must determine the  eligibility of each applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining eligibility for medical assistance, the State  agency must comply with regulations governing applications,  determinations of eligibility, and furnishing Medicaid (including the  opportunity for fair hearings) in the States and the District of  Columbia under 42 CFR part 435, subpart J, and in Guam, Puerto Rico, and  the Virgin Islands under 42 CFR part 436, subpart J, and 42 CFR part  431, subpart E.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the State must  notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which provided for the  initial resettlement of a refugee whenever the refugee applies for  medical assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate  that assistance has been authorized or that it has been denied or  terminated, the State must specify the program(s) to which the notice  applies, clearly distinguishing between refugee medical assistance and  Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). For  example, if a refugee applies for assistance, is determined ineligible  for Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)  but eligible for refugee medical assistance, the notice must specify  clearly the determinations with respect both to Medicaid or the State  Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and to refugee medical  assistance.
