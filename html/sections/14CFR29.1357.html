However, individual protection for each circuit in an essential load system (such as each position light circuit in a system) is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If fuses are used, there must be spare fuses for use in flight equal to at least 50 percent of the number of fuses of each rating required for complete circuit protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Automatic reset circuit breakers may be used as integral protectors for electrical equipment provided there is circuit protection for the cable supplying power to the equipment.
