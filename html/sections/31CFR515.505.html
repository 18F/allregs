                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General license unblocking certain persons. The following  persons are licensed as unblocked nationals, as that term is defined in  Sec. 515.307 of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any individual national of Cuba who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has taken up residence in the United States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is a United States citizen; is a lawful permanent resident  alien of the United States; has applied to become a lawful permanent  resident alien of the United States and has an adjustment of status  application pending; or is lawfully present and intending to lawfully  remain in the United States on a permanent basis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is not a prohibited official of the Government of Cuba, as  defined in Sec. 515.337 of this part, or a prohibited member of the  Cuban Communist Party, as defined in Sec. 515.338 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any individual national of Cuba who has taken up permanent  residence outside of Cuba, provided that the required documentation  specified in paragraph (c) of this section is obtained and the  individual is not a prohibited official of the Government of Cuba, as  defined in Sec. 515.337 of this part, or a prohibited member of the  Cuban Communist Party, as defined in Sec. 515.338 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any entity that otherwise would be a national of Cuba solely  because of the interest therein of one or more persons licensed in this  paragraph (a) as an unblocked national.</p><p class="depth3">Note to Sec. 515.505(a):</p><p class="depth3">An individual unblocked pursuant to this paragraph does not become  blocked again merely by leaving the United States or the country in  which he or she has taken up permanent residence. An individual  unblocked national remains unblocked unless and until the individual  thereafter becomes domiciled in or a permanent resident of Cuba.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General license unblocking blocked accounts. Banking  institutions, as defined in Sec. 515.314, including U.S. registered  brokers or dealers in securities and U.S. registered money transmitters,  are authorized to unblock any   blocked account, as defined in Sec. 515.319, that had been previously  blocked solely because of the interest therein of one or more persons  licensed in paragraph (a) of this section as unblocked nationals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required documentation. In determining whether an individual  national of Cuba qualifies as an unblocked national under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction must obtain  evidence demonstrating that the individual satisfies the requirements of  that paragraph. Such evidence may include copies of documents issued by  government authorities demonstrating citizenship or lawful permanent  residence in a third country. These could include, depending on the  information provided in the document in question, a passport, voter  registration card, permanent resident alien card, national identity  card, or other similar documents. Where such documents are unavailable,  persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction may also rely on evidence that the  individual has been resident for the past two years without interruption  in a single country outside of Cuba, or a sworn statement or other  evidence that the individual does not intend to, or would not be welcome  to, return to Cuba.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the term  ``lawfully present and intending to lawfully remain in the United States  on a permanent basis'' includes an individual with a pending application  for asylum or who has been paroled into the United States under Cuban  Parole or Cuban Medical designations. It does not include anyone present  in the United States in a non-immigrant status.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 515.505: See Sec. 515.571 for the authorization of  certain limited transactions incident to travel to, from, and within the  United States by Cuban nationals who are present in the United States in  a non-immigrant status or pursuant to other non-immigrant travel  authorization issued by the U.S. government.
