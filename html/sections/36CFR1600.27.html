                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), you may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the Foundation to another person, organization, or agency of any record about you. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. Your request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made by writing to the Foundation, following the procedures in Sec. 1600.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where accountings are not required. The Foundation is not required to provide accountings to you where they relate to disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept--in other words, disclosures that are made to employees within the agency and disclosures that are made under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting to the Foundation Executive Director in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see Sec. 1600.25) and the same procedures will be followed.</p>
