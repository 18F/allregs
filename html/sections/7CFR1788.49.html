                            <p class="depth0">Construction contracts in amounts in excess of $250,000 for  facilities shall require contractors to secure a contractors' bond, on a  form approved by RUS, attached to the contract in a penal sum of not  less than the contract price, which is the sum of all labor and  materials including owner-furnished materials installed in the project.  RUS Form 168b is for use when the contract exceeds $250,000. RUS Form  168c is for use when the contractor's surety has accepted a Small  Business Administration guarantee and the contract is for $1,000,000 or  less. For minor construction contracts under which work will be done in  sections and no section will exceed a total cost of $250,000, the  borrower may waive the requirement for a contractors' bond.</p>
