                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>, as amended, and environmental  issues and other documents that, because of the nature of their subject  matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests. To save both time  and money, CEQ strongly urges requesters to review documents currently  available from the Center's Online Reading Room before submitting a  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requesting information from the Council. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requesters must  make a Freedom of Information Act request in writing. For quickest  possible handling, it should be sent via e-mail to: efoia@ceq.eop.gov  and must include in the subject line of the e-mail message: ``Freedom of  Information Act Request.'' Written requests may also be faxed to (202)  456-0753 or addressed and mailed to: Council on Environmental Quality,  Executive Office of the President, 722 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC  20503. Requesters should mark both the request letter and the envelope  ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' and include their name, address,  and sufficient contact information to allow follow up regarding the  scope and status of your request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request should identify or reasonably describe the desired  record. It should be as specific as possible, so that the item can be  readily found. Blanket requests, such as requests for ``all materials  relating to'' a specified subject are not recommended. Requesters should  specify the preferred form or format (including electronic format) for  the response. CEQ will accommodate such requests, if the record is  readily reproducible in that form or format. Please be aware that FOIA  requests and responses may themselves be made available for public  inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The CEQ FOIA Officer is responsible for acting on all initial  requests; however, he or she may consult and refer, pursuant to Section  552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(III) of the FOIA, with another agency if he or she  determines that that agency is better able to act on the request.  Whenever the CEQ FOIA Officer refers all or any part of the  responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, he or she  will notify the requester of the referral, the name of the agency and  agency official to whom it has been referred, and which portion of the  request has been referred. Unless a request is deemed ``expedited'' as  set forth in Section 1515.7 below, the CEQ FOIA Officer will respond to  requests in order of receipt. CEQ may use two or more processing tracks  by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the  amount of time and work needed to process the request. CEQ may provide  requesters on a slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their  request in order to qualify for faster processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Council will make a reasonable effort to assist with  defining the request to eliminate extraneous and unwanted materials and  to keep search and copying fees to a minimum. If budgetary constraints  exist, the requester should indicate the maximum fee he or she is  prepared to pay to acquire the information. (See also Sec.  1515.11)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Freedom of Information Act does not require a government  agency to create or research information; rather, it only requires that  existing records be made available to the public.</p>
