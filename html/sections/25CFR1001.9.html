                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who is eligible to apply for a planning grant that will be  awarded before a tribe/consortium is admitted into the applicant pool?  Any tribe/consortium that is not a self-governance tribe and needs  advance funding in order to complete the planning phase requirement may  apply. Tribes/consortia that have received a planning grant within 3  years preceding the date of the latest Federal Register announcement  described in Sec. 1001.7 are not eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What must a tribe/consortium seeking a planning grant submit in  order to meet the planning phase requirements? A tribe/consortium must  submit the following material:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A tribal resolution or other final action of the tribal  governing body indicating a desire to plan for tribal self-governance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Audits from the last 3 years which document that the tribe meets  the requirement of being free from any material audit exception;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A proposal that describes the tribe's/consortium's plans to  conduct:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Legal and budgetary research, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Internal tribal government and organization planning;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A timeline indicating when planning will start and end; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evidence that the tribe/consortium can perform the tasks  associated with its proposal (i.e., submit resumes and position  descriptions of key staff or consultants to be used).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How will tribes/consortia know when and how to apply for  planning grants? Each year, we will publish in the Federal Register a  notice of the availability of planning grants for additional tribes as  described in Sec. 1001.7. This notice will identify the specific  details for applying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What criteria will be used to award planning grants to those  tribes/consortia requiring advance funding to meet the planning phase  requirement of Public Law 103-413? Advance planning grants are  discretionary and based on need. The following criteria will be used to  determine whether to award a planning grant to a tribe/consortium before  the tribe is being selected into the applicant pool:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A complete application as described in Sec. Sec. 1001.9(b) and  1001.9(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A demonstration of financial need. We will rank applications  according to the percentage of tribal resources to total resources as  indicated in the latest A-128 audit. We will give priority to  applications that demonstrate financial need by having a lower level of  tribal resources as a percent of total resources; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other factors that demonstrate the readiness of the tribe/ consortium to enter into a self-governance agreement, including previous  efforts of the tribe/consortium to participate in self-governance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Can tribes/consortia that receive advance planning grants also  apply for a negotiation grant? Yes. Tribes/consortia that receive  advance planning grants may submit a completed application to be  included in the applicant pool. Once approved for inclusion in the  applicant pool, the tribe/consortium may apply for a negotiation grant  according to the process identified in Sec. 1001.7 above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When and how will a tribe/consortium know whether it has been  selected to receive an advance planning grant? Within 30 days of the  deadline for submitting applications we will notify the tribe/consortium  by letter whether it has been selected to receive an advance planning  grant.
