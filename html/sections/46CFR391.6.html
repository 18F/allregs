                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 607(g) of the Act and this section provide  rules for the income tax treatment of qualified withdrawals including  the income tax treatment on the disposition of assets acquired with fund  amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts.  A qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made:  First, out of the capital account; second, out of the capital gain  account; and third, out of the ordinary income account. Such withdrawals  will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first- out basis, the earliest qualified withdrawals reducing the items within  an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed  deposited in accordance with this part. The date funds are actually  withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are  considered to be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of basis. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any portion of a qualified withdrawal  for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge,  or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income  account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share  therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition,  construction or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or  share therein) is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of  such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by  an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five-eights of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other  than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371  of the Code), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Code for  depreciation or amortization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Basis for depreciation. For purposes of determining the  allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of  any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from  qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such  property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In  the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the  application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a  method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the  property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments  made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall  reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year,  and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's  taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of  the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of  methods of accounting, see Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax  Regulations of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ordinary income treatment of gain from disposition of property  acquired with qualified withdrawals.
