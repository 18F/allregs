                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 607(g) of the Act and this section provide rules for the income tax treatment of qualified withdrawals including the income tax treatment on the disposition of assets acquired with fund amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts. A qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: First, out of the capital account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the ordinary income account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-out basis, the earliest qualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of basis. (1) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five-eights of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 of the Code), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal of an indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then the basis of the vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) with respect to which such indebtedness was incurred is reduced in the manner provided by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. If the aggregate amount of such withdrawal from the ordinary income account and capital gain account would cause a basis reduction in excess of the party's basis in such vessel, barge, or container (or

share therein), the excess is applied against the basis of other vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) owned by the party at the time of withdrawal in the following order: (i) Vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) which were the subject of qualified withdrawals in the order in which they were acquired, constructed, or reconstructed; (ii) agreement vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(3) of the Act and Sec. 391.11(a)(3)) and barges and containers which are part of the complement of an agreement vessel (or shares therein) which were not the subject of qualified withdrawals, in the order in which such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) were acquired by the party; and (iii) other vessels, barges, and containers (or shares therein), in the order in which they were acquired by the party. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of this paragraph is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. If the indebtedness was incurred to acquire two or more vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein), then the basis reduction in such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) is to be made pro rata in proportion to the adjusted basis of such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) computed, however, without regard to this section and adjustments under section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code for depreciation or amortization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Basis for depreciation. For purposes of determining the allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year, and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of methods of accounting, see Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ordinary income treatment of gain from disposition of property acquired with qualified withdrawals.
