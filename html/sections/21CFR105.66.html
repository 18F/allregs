                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Any food that purports to be or is  represented for special dietary use because of usefulness in reducing or  maintaining body weight shall bear:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nutrition labeling in conformity with Sec. 101.9, or, where  applicable, Sec. 101.36 of this chapter, unless exempt under that  section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A conspicuous statement of the basis upon which the food claims  to be of special dietary usefulness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonnutritive ingredients. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any food subject to paragraph (a)  of this section that achieves its special dietary usefulness by use of a  nonnutritive ingredient (i.e., one not utilized in normal metabolism)  shall bear on its label a statement that it contains a nonnutritive  ingredient and the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive ingredient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A special dietary food may contain a nonnutritive sweetener or  other ingredient only if the ingredient is safe for use in the food  under the applicable law and regulations of this chapter. Any food that  achieves its special dietary usefulness in reducing or maintaining body  weight through the use of a nonnutritive sweetener shall bear on its  label the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but  need not state the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive sweetener.  If a nutritive sweetener(s) as well as   nonnutritive sweetener(s) is added, the statement shall indicate the  presence of both types of sweetener, e.g., ``Sweetened with nutritive  sweetener(s) and nonnutritive sweetener(s).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ``Low calorie'' foods. A food purporting to be ``low calorie''  must comply with the criteria set forth for such foods in  Sec. 101.60(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ``Reduced calorie'' foods and other comparative calorie claims.  A food purporting to be ``reduced calorie'' or otherwise containing  fewer calories than a reference food must comply with the criteria set  forth for such food in Sec. 101.60(b)(4) and (b)(5) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Label terms suggesting usefulness as low calorie or reduced  calorie foods. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of  this section, and in Sec. 101.13(q)(2) of this chapter for soft drinks,  a food may be labeled with terms such as ``diet,'' ``dietetic,''  ``artificially sweetened,'' or ``sweetened with nonnutritive sweetener''  only if the claim is not false and misleading, and the food is labeled  ``low calorie'' or ``reduced calorie'' or bears another comparative  calorie claim in compliance with part 101 of this chapter and this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of  such terms that is specifically authorized by regulation governing a  particular food, or, unless otherwise restricted by regulation, to any  use of the term ``diet'' that clearly shows that the food is offered  solely for a dietary use other than regulating body weight, e.g., ``for  low-sodium diets.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of  such terms on a formulated meal replacement or other food that is  represented to be of special dietary use as a whole meal, pending the  issuance of a regulation governing the use of such terms on foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> ``Sugar free,'' and ``no added sugar.'' Criteria for the use of  the terms ``sugar free'' and ``no added sugar'' are provided for in  Sec. 101.60(c) of this chapter.
