Immediately prior to starting the test, frozen liquid vaccine shall be thawed, and lyophilized vaccine shall be rehydrated to the volume recommended on the label with mycoplasma medium. In the case of a lyophilized biological product, e.g., 1,000 dose vial of poultry vaccine to be administered via the drinking water, the vaccine shall be rehydrated to 30 ml with mycoplasma medium. In the case of a cell line or a sample of primary cells, the inoculum shall consist of the resuspended cells. Control

tests shall be established as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inoculation of plate. Plate 0.1 ml of inoculum on an agar plate and make a short, continuous streak across the plate with a pipet. Tilt the plate to allow the inoculum to flow over the surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inoculation of flask of medium. Transfer 1 ml of the inoculum into a flask containing 100 ml mycoplasma medium and mix thoroughly. Incubate the flask at 33 to 37 [deg]C for 14 days during which time, one of four agar plates shall be streaked with 0.1 ml of material from the incubating flask of inoculated medium on the 3d day, one on the 7th day, one on the 10th day, and one on the 14th day post-inoculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control tests shall be conducted simultaneously with the detection test using techniques provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, except the inoculum for the positive control test shall be selected mycoplasma cultures and the negative control test shall be uninoculated medium from the same lot used in the detection test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All plates shall be incubated in a high humidity, 4-6 percent CO2 atmosphere at 33 [deg]to 37 [deg]C for 10-14 days and examined with a stereoscopic microscope at 35x to 100x or with a regular microscope at 100x.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interpretation of test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If growth appears on at least one of the plates in the positive control test and does not appear on any of the plates in the negative control test, the test is valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If mycoplasma colonies are found on any of the plates inoculated with material being tested, the results are positive for mycoplasma contamination.
