The working pressure rating of the BOP system and BOP system components shall exceed the expected surface pressure to which they may be subjected. If the expected surface pressure exceeds the rated working pressure of the annular preventer, the lessee shall submit with Form BSEE-0124 or Form BSEE-0123, as appropriate, a well-control procedure that indicates how the annular preventer will be utilized, and the pressure limitations that will be applied during each mode of pressure control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The minimum BOP system for well-completion operations must meet the appropriate standards from the following table:

Accumulator regulators supplied by rig air and without a secondary source of pneumatic supply, must be equipped with manual overrides, or alternately, other devices provided to ensure capability of hydraulic operations if rig air is lost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A secondary power source, independent from the primary power source, with sufficient capacity to close all BOP system components and hold them closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Locking devices for the pipe-ram preventers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At least one remote BOP-control station and one BOP-control station on the rig floor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A choke line and a kill line each equipped with two full opening valves and a choke manifold. At least one of the valves on the choke line shall be remotely controlled. At least one of the valves on the kill line shall be remotely controlled, except that a check valve on the kill line in lieu of the remotely controlled valve may be installed provided that two readily accessible manual valves are in place and the check valve is placed between the manual valves and the pump. This equipment shall have a pressure rating at least equivalent to the ram preventers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An inside BOP or a spring-loaded, back-pressure safety valve and an essentially full-opening, work-string safety valve in the open position shall be maintained on the rig floor at all times during well-completion operations. A wrench to fit the work-string safety valve shall be readily available. Proper connections shall be readily available for inserting valves in the work string.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The subsea BOP system for well-completions must meet the requirements in Sec.  250.442 of this part.
