                            <p class="depth0">Employees engaged in the gathering or harvesting of wild commodities  such as mosses, wild rice, burls and laurel plants, the trapping of wild  animals, or the appropriation of minerals and other uncultivated  products from the soil are not employed in ``the production,  cultivation, growing, and harvesting of agricultural or horticultural  commodities.'' However, the fact that plants or other commodities  actually cultivated by men are of a species which ordinarily grows wild  without being cultivated does not preclude them from being classed as  ``agricultural or horticultural commodities.'' Transplanted branches  which were cut from plants growing wild in the field or forest are  included within the term. Cultivated blueberries are also included.</p>
