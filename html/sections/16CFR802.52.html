The buyer is ``A,'' a U.S. person. Regardless of the aggregate sales in or into the United States attributable to the assets of B, the transaction is exempt under this section. (If such aggregate sales were $50 million (as adjusted) or

less, the transaction would also be exempt under Sec. 802.50).
