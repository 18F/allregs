                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Shareholder meetings. An annual meeting of the shareholders of  the subsidiary holding company for the election of directors and for the  transaction of any other business of the subsidiary holding company  shall be held annually within 150 days after the end of the subsidiary  holding company's fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided in the  subsidiary holding company's charter, special meetings of the  shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request  of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at  the meeting, or by such other persons as may be specified in the bylaws  of the subsidiary holding company. All annual and special meetings of  shareholders shall be held at such place as the board of directors may  determine in the state in which the subsidiary savings association has  its principal place of business, or at any other convenient place the  board of directors may designate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of shareholder meetings. Written notice stating the  place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for  which the meeting is called shall be delivered not fewer than 20 nor  more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or  by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the  president, the secretary, or the directors, or other natural persons  calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at  such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered  when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address  appearing on the stock transfer   books or records of the subsidiary holding company as of the record date  prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, with postage thereon  prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is  adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be  given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in  this section, however, a subsidiary holding company that is wholly owned  shall not be subject to the shareholder notice requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fixing of record date. For the purpose of determining  shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of  shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to  receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of  shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall  fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of  shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days and,  in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the  date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of  shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as  provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any  adjournment thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voting lists. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 20 days before each meeting of the  shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer  books for the shares of the subsidiary holding company shall make a  complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such  meeting, or any adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order,  with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of  shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the subsidiary  holding company and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder of  record or the stockholder's agent during the entire time of the meeting.  The original stock transfer book shall constitute prima facie evidence  of the stockholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or  to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this  section, however, a subsidiary holding company that is wholly owned  shall not be subject to the voting list requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection  by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the  board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a)  and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly  requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly  considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is  entitled to vote on such matter and who shall defray the reasonable  expenses to be incurred by the subsidiary holding company in performance  of the act or acts required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shareholder quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the  subsidiary holding company entitled to vote, represented in person or by  proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The  shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to  transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of  enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present,  the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the  meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of  the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders  voting together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter.  Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an  election of directors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Shareholder voting-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in  the subsidiary holding company's charter, at all meetings of  shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in  writing by the shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact.  Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the  holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. A  proxy may designate as holder a corporation, partnership or company, or  other person. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be  voted as directed by the shareholder or,   in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the  board of directors. No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months from  the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shares controlled by subsidiary holding company. Neither  treasury shares of its own stock held by the subsidiary holding company  nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares  entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation  are held by the subsidiary holding company, shall be voted at any  meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares  at any given time for purposes of any meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nominations and new business submitted by shareholders.  Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders  shall be voted upon at the annual meeting if such nominations or new  business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the  subsidiary holding company at least five days prior to the date of the  annual meeting. Ballots bearing the names of all the natural persons  nominated shall be provided for use at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Informal action by stockholders. If the bylaws of the subsidiary  holding company so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting  of the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting  of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in  writing has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with  respect to the subject matter.</p>
