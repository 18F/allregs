                            <p class="depth0">Charges for the establishment, maintenance, and replacement by the Coast Guard of an aid, either permanent or temporary, to mark a sunken wreck or other obstruction to navigation are calculated to recover the Coast Guard costs involved in, or associated with, the marking process. These charges will be invoiced to the owner of the obstruction. Charges for the removal of aids to navigation established by the Coast Guard will be invoiced to the owner unless the District Engineer requests the continued marking of the obstruction. All charges will be assessed in accordance with Subpart 74.20 of this part.
