                            <p class="depth0">If a beneficiary who is receiving services from the State VR agency  under an existing IPE becomes eligible for a ticket that is available  for assignment, the State VR agency must submit the information required  in Sec. 411.385(a) to the PM. We require this information in order for  the beneficiary's ticket to be considered in use. If a beneficiary who  is receiving services from the State VR agency under an existing IPE  becomes eligible for a ticket that is available for assignment, the  State VR agency is limited to the cost reimbursement payment system,  unless both the beneficiary and the State VR agency agree to have the  ticket assigned to the State VR agency.
