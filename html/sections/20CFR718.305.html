Sec. 718.306    [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 718--Standards for Administration and</p><p class="depth0">Interpretation of Chest Radiographs (X-rays)</p><p class="depth0">The following standards are established in accordance with sections 402(f)(1)(D) and 413(b) of the Act. They were developed in consultation with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Department of Health and Human Services. These standards are promulgated for the guidance of physicians and medical technicians to ensure that uniform procedures are used in administering and interpreting X-rays and that the best available medical evidence will be submitted in connection with a claim for black lung benefits. If it is established that one or more standards have not been met, the claims adjudicator may consider such fact in determining the evidentiary weight to be assigned to the physician's report of an X-ray.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. (1) Digital radiography systems, as used in this context, include both digital radiography (DR) and computed radiography (CR). Digital radiography is the term used for digital X-ray image acquisition systems in which the X-ray signals received by the image detector are converted nearly instantaneously to electronic signals without moveable cassettes. Computed radiography is the term for digital X-ray image acquisition systems that detect X-ray signals using a cassette-based photostimulable storage phosphor. Subsequently, the cassette is processed using a stimulating laser beam to convert the latent radiographic image to electronic signals which are then processed and stored so they can be displayed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified medical physicist means an individual who is trained in evaluating the performance of radiographic equipment including radiation controls and facility quality assurance programs, and has the relevant current certification by a competent U.S. national board, or unrestricted license or approval from a U.S. State or Territory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Radiographic technique chart means a table that specifies the types of cassette, intensifying screen, film or digital detector, grid, filter, and lists X-ray machine settings (timing, kVp, mA) that enables the radiographer to select the correct settings based on the body habitus or the thickness of the chest tissue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Radiologic technologist means an individual who has met the requirements for privileges to perform general radiographic procedures and for competence in using the equipment and software employed by the examining facility to obtain chest images as specified by the State or Territory and examining facility in which such services are provided.

Radiographic equipment, its use and the facilities (including mobile facilities) in which such equipment is used must conform to applicable State or Territorial and Federal regulations. Where no applicable regulations exist regarding reducing the risk from ionizing radiation exposure in the clinical setting, radiographic equipment, its use and the facilities (including mobile facilities) in which such equipment is used should conform to the recommendations in NCRP Report No. 102, NCRP Report No. 105, and NCRP Report No. 147 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 718.5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chest radiographs of miners must be performed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By or under the supervision of a physician who makes chest radiographs in the

normal course of practice and who has demonstrated ability to make chest radiographs of a quality to best ascertain the presence of pneumoconiosis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By a radiologic technologist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Miners must be disrobed from the waist up at the time the radiograph is given. The facility must provide a dressing area and for those miners who wish to use one, the facility will provide a clean gown.

In a case of a substandard radiograph, another must be made immediately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Chest radiograph specifications--film. (1) Every chest radiograph must be a single posteroanterior projection at full inspiration on a film being no less than 14 by 17 inch film. Additional chest films or views must be obtained if they are necessary for clarification and classification. The film and cassette must be capable of being positioned both vertically and horizontally so that the chest radiograph will include both apices and costophrenic angles. If a miner is too large to permit the above requirements, then a projection with minimum loss of costophrenic angle must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Radiographs must be made with a diagnostic X-ray machine having a rotating anode tube with a maximum of a 2 mm source (focal spot).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this appendix, radiographs must be made with units having generators that comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generators of existing radiographic units acquired by the examining facility prior to July 27, 1973, must have a minimum rating of 200 mA at 100 kVp;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Generators of units acquired subsequent to that date must have a minimum rating of 300 mA at 125 kVp.

The use of such a device must be discernible from an examination of the radiograph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> To ensure high quality chest radiographs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum exposure time must not exceed 50 milliseconds except that with single phase units with a rating less than 300 mA at 125 kVp and subjects with chests over 28 cm postero-anterior, the exposure may be increased to not more than 100 milliseconds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The source or focal spot to film distance must be at least 6 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medium-speed film and medium-speed intensifying screens are recommended. However, any film-screen combination, the rated ``speed'' of which is at least 100 and does not exceed 300, which produces radiographs with spatial resolution, contrast, latitude and quantum mottle similar to those of systems designated as ``medium speed'' may be employed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Film-screen contact must be maintained and verified at 6-month or shorter intervals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Intensifying screens must be inspected at least once a month and cleaned when necessary by the method recommended by the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All intensifying screens in a cassette must be of the same type and made by the same manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> When using over 90 kV, a suitable grid or other means of reducing scattered radiation must be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The geometry of the radiographic system must ensure that the central axis (ray) of the primary beam is perpendicular to the plane of the film surface and impinges on the center of the film.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Radiographic processing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Either automatic or manual film processing is acceptable.

The imaging plate must have a maximum pixel pitch of 200 [micro]m, with a minimum bit depth of 10. Spatial resolution

must be at least 2.5 line pairs per millimeter. The storage phosphor cassette or digital image detector must be positioned either vertically or horizontally so that the image includes the apices and costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs. If the detector cannot include the apices and costophrenic angles of both lungs as described, then the two side-by-side images can be obtained that together include the apices and costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Radiographs must be made with a diagnostic X-ray machine with a maximum actual (not nominal) source (focal spot) of 2 mm, as measured in two orthogonal directions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Radiographs must be made with units having generators which have a minimum rating of 300 mA at 125 kVp.

Image management software and settings for routine chest imaging must be used, including routine amplification of digital detector signal as well as standard image post-processing functions. Image or edge enhancement software functions must not be employed unless they are integral to the digital radiography system (not elective); in such cases, only the minimum image enhancement permitted by the system may be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(A)</em> The image object, transmission and associated data storage, film format, and transmissions of associated information must conform to the following components of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 718.5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The image object, transmission and associated data storage, film format, and transmissions of associated information must conform to the following components of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 718.5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.3-2011, Annex A--Composite Information Object Definitions, sections: Computed Radiographic Image Information Object Definition; Digital X-Ray Image Information Object Definition; X-Ray Radiation Dose SR Information Object Definition; and Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State Information Object Definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.4-2011: Annex B--Storage Service Class; Annex N--Softcopy Presentation State Storage SOP Classes; Annex O--Structured Reporting Storage SOP Classes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.10-2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.11-2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.12-2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> DICOM Standard PS 13.14-2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> DICOM Standard PS 3.16-2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identification of each miner, chest image, facility, date and time of the examination must be encoded within the image information object, according to DICOM Standard PS 3.3-2011, Information Object Definitions, for the DICOM ``DX'' object.

As individuals with obstructive disease or rapid decline in lung function will be less likely to achieve this degree of reproducibility, tests not meeting this criterion may still be submitted for consideration in support of a claim for black lung benefits. Failure to meet this standard should be clearly noted in the test report by the physician conducting or reviewing the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For the MVV, the subject shall be instructed before beginning the test that he or she will be asked to breathe as deeply and as rapidly as possible for approximately 15 seconds. The test shall be performed with the subject in the standing position, if possible. Care shall be taken on repeat testing that the same position be used. The subject shall breathe normally into the mouthpiece of the

apparatus for 10 to 15 seconds to become accustomed to the system. The subject shall then be instructed to breathe as deeply and as rapidly as possible, and shall be continually encouraged during the remainder of the maneuver. Subject shall continue the maneuver for 15 seconds. At least 5 minutes of rest shall be allowed between maneuvers. At least three MVV's shall be carried out. (But see Sec. 718.103(b).) During the maneuvers the patient shall be observed for compliance with instructions. The effort shall be judged unacceptable when the patient:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has not maintained consistent effort for at least 12 to 15 seconds; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has coughed or closed his glottis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece (obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest MVVs of the three satisfactory tracings shall not exceed 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A calibration check shall be performed on the instrument each day before use, using a volume source of at least three liters, accurate to within 1 percent of full scale. The volume calibration shall be performed in accordance with the method described in paragraph (1)(vii) of this Appendix. Accuracy of the time measurement used in determining the FEV1 shall be checked using the manufacturer's stated procedure and shall be within 3 percent of actual. The procedure described in the Appendix shall be performed as well as any other procedures suggested by the manufacturer of the spirometer being used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(A)</em> The first step in evaluating a spirogram for the FVC and FEV1 shall be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in (2)(ii) of this Appendix. The largest recorded FVC and FEV1, corrected to BTPS, shall be used in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The first step in evaluating a spirogram for the FVC and FEV1 shall be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in (2)(ii) of this Appendix. The largest recorded FVC and FEV1, corrected to BTPS, shall be used in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only MVV maneuvers which demonstrate consistent effort for at least 12 seconds shall be considered acceptable. The largest accumulated volume for a 12 second period corrected to BTPS and multiplied by five or the largest accumulated volume for a 15 second period corrected to BTPS and multiplied by four is to be reported as the MVV.
