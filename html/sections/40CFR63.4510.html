If you   are using compliance with the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light- Duty Trucks NESHAP (subpart IIII of this part) as provided for under  Sec. 63.4481(d) to constitute compliance with this subpart for any or  all of your plastic parts coating operations, then you must include a  statement to this effect in your initial notification, and no other  notifications are required under this subpart in regard to those plastic  parts coating operations. If you are complying with another NESHAP that  constitutes the predominant activity at your facility under Sec.  63.4481(e)(2) to constitute compliance with this subpart for your  plastic parts coating operations, then you must include a statement to  this effect in your initial notification, and no other notifications are  required under this subpart in regard to those plastic parts coating  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (11) of  this section and in Sec. 63.9(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name,  title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness  of the content of the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date of the report and beginning and ending dates of the  reporting period.
