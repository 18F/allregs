                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, all matters arbitrated under these rules  shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Party-appointed arbitrators. The party or parties on each side  of an arbitration dispute shall select one arbitrator, and serve notice  of the selection upon the Board and the opposing party within 20 days of  an arbitration answer being filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parties on one side of an arbitration proceeding may not  challenge the arbitrator selected by the opposing side.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties to an arbitration proceeding are responsible for the  costs of the arbitrator they select.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Selecting the neutral arbitrator. The Board shall provide the  parties with a list of five neutral arbitrators within 20 days of an  arbitration answer being filed. When compiling a list of neutral  arbitrators for a particular arbitration proceeding, the Board will  conduct searches for arbitration experts by contacting appropriate  professional arbitration associations. The parties will have 14 days  from the date the Board provides them with this list to select a neutral  arbitrator using a single strike methodology. The complainant will  strike one name from the list first. The respondent will then have the  opportunity to strike one name from the list. The process will then  repeat until one individual on the list remains, who shall be the  neutral arbitrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parties are responsible for conducting their own due  diligence in striking names from the neutral arbitrator list. The final  selection of a neutral arbitrator is not challengeable before the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties shall split the cost of the neutral arbitrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The neutral arbitrator appointed through the strike methodology  shall serve as the head of the arbitration panel and will be responsible  for ensuring that the tasks detailed in Sec. Sec.  1108.7 and 1108.9 are  accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of a single arbitrator. Parties to arbitration may request  the use of a single-neutral arbitrator. Requests for use of a single- neutral arbitrator must be included in a complaint or an answer as  required in Sec.  1108.5(a)(1). Parties to both sides of an arbitration  dispute must agree to the use of a single-neutral arbitrator in writing.  If the single-arbitrator option is selected, the arbitrator selection  procedures outlined in Sec.  1108.6(c) shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Arbitrator incapacitation. If at any time during the arbitration  process a selected arbitrator becomes incapacitated or is unwilling or  unable to fulfill his or her duties, a replacement arbitrator shall be  promptly selected by either of the following processes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the incapacitated arbitrator was appointed directly by a  party to the arbitration, the appointing party shall, without delay,  appoint a replacement arbitrator pursuant to the procedures set forth in  Sec.  1108.6(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the incapacitated arbitrator was the neutral arbitrator, the  parties   shall promptly inform the Board of the neutral arbitrator's  incapacitation and the selection procedures set forth in Sec.  1108.6(c)  shall apply.</p>
