                                Sec. 306.10  Automotive fuel rating posting.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are a retailer, you must post the automotive fuel rating  of all automotive fuel you sell to consumers. You must do this by  putting at least one label on each face of each dispenser through which  you sell automotive fuel. If you are selling two or more kinds of  automotive fuel with different automotive fuel ratings from a single  dispenser, you must put separate labels for each kind of automotive fuel  on each face of the dispenser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label, or labels, must be placed conspicuously on the  dispenser so as to be in full view of consumers and as near as  reasonably practical to the price per unit of the automotive fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may petition for an exemption from the placement  requirements by writing the Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission,  Washington, DC 20580. You must state the reasons that you want the  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of gasoline, if you do not blend the gasoline with  other gasoline, you must post the octane rating of the gasoline  consistent with the octane rating certified to you. If you blend the  gasoline with other gasoline, you must post consistent with your  determination of the average, weighted by volume, of the octane ratings  certified to you for each gasoline in the blend, or consistent with the  lowest octane rating certified to you for any gasoline in the blend.  Whether you blend gasoline or not, you may choose to post the octane  rating of the gasoline consistent with your determination of the octane  rating according to the method in Sec. 306.5. In cases involving  gasoline, the octane rating must be shown as a whole or half number  equal to or less than the number certified to you or determined by you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you do not blend alternative liquid automotive fuels, you  must post consistent with the automotive fuel rating certified to you.  If you blend alternative liquid automotive fuels, you must possess a  reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the  automotive fuel rating that you post for the blend.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must maintain and replace labels as needed to make sure  consumers can easily see and read them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the labels you have are destroyed or are unusable or  unreadable for some unexpected reason, you can satisfy the law by  posting a temporary label as much like the required label as possible.  You must still get and post the required label without delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following examples of automotive fuel rating disclosures for  some presently available alternative liquid automotive fuels are meant  to serve as illustrations of compliance with this part, but do not limit  the Rule's coverage to only the mentioned fuels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Methanol/Minimum ------% Methanol''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Ethanol/Minimum ------% Ethanol''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``M--85/Minimum ------% Methanol''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``E--85/Minimum ------% Ethanol''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``LPG/Minimum ------% Propane'' or</p><p class="depth3">``LPG/Minimum ------% Propane and ------% Butane''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ``LNG/Minimum ------% Methane''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> ``B-20 Biodiesel Blend/contains biomass-based diesel or  biodiesel in quantities between 5 percent and 20 percent''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ``20% Biomass-Based Diesel Blend/contains biomass-based diesel  or biodiesel in quantities between 5 percent and 20 percent''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> ``B-100 Biodiesel/contains 100 percent biodiesel''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> ``100% Biomass-Based Diesel/contains 100 percent biomass-based  diesel''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When you receive automotive fuel from a common carrier, you also  must receive from the common carrier a certification of the automotive  fuel rating of the automotive fuel, either by letter or on the delivery  ticket or other paper.
