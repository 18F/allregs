When an application is selected subject to conditions established by the Agency, the Agency will notify the applicant using a Letter of Conditions, which defines the conditions under which the grant will be made. Each grantee will be required to meet all terms and conditions of the award within 90 days of receiving a Letter of Conditions unless otherwise specified by the Agency at the time of the award. If the applicant agrees with the conditions, the applicant must complete, sign, and return the Agency's Form RD 1942-46, ``Letter of Intent to Meet Conditions.'' If the applicant believes that certain conditions cannot be met, the applicant may propose alternate conditions to the Agency. The Agency must concur with any proposed changes to the Letter of Conditions by the applicant before the application will be further processed. If the Agency agrees to any proposed changes, the Agency will issue a revised or amended Letter of Conditions that defines the final conditions under which the grant will be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant agreement and conditions.
