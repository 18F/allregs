The most critical turbine blade must be determined by considering turbine blade weight and the strength of the adjacent turbine case at case temperatures and pressures associated with operation at maximum permissible r.p.m.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Analysis based on rig testing, component testing, or service experience may be substitute for one of the engine tests prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That test, of the two prescribed, produces the least rotor unbalance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The analysis is shown to be equivalent to the test.
