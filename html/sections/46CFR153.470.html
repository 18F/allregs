Sec.  153.1126 and 153.1128 must have an NLS residue discharge system meeting the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minimum diameter of an NLS residue discharge outlet. The outlet of each NLS residue discharge system must have a diameter at least as great as that given by the following formula:
