                            <p class="depth0">The labeling of an over-the-counter drug product written for health  professionals (but not for the general public) shall consist of the  following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For products containing aspirin identified in Sec. Sec. 343.12  and 343.13 or permitted combinations identified in Sec. 343.22. (These  products must meet United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for  dissolution or drug release in Sec. 343.90.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The labeling contains the following prescribing information  under the heading ``Comprehensive Prescribing Information'' and the  subheadings ``Description,'' ``Clinical Pharmacology,'' ``Clinical  Studies,'' ``Animal Toxicology,'' ``Indications and Usage,''  ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings,'' ``Precautions,'' ``Adverse  Reactions,'' ``Drug Abuse and Dependence,'' ``Overdosage,'' ``Dosage and  Administration,'' and ``How Supplied'' in the exact language and the  exact order provided as follows:</p><p class="depth3">COMPREHENSIVE PRESCRIBING INFORMATION</p><p class="depth3">DESCRIPTION</p><p class="depth3">(Insert the proprietary name and the established name (if any) of  the drug, type of dosage form (followed by the phrase ``for oral  administration''), the established name(s) and quantity of the active  ingredient(s) per dosage unit, the total sodium content in milligrams  per dosage unit if the sodium content of a single recommended dose is 5  milligrams or more, the established name(s) (in alphabetical order) of  any inactive ingredient(s) which may cause an allergic hypersensitivity  reaction, the pharmacological or therapeutic class of the drug, and the  chemical name(s) and structural formula(s) of the drug.) Aspirin is an  odorless white, needle-like crystalline or powdery substance. When  exposed to moisture, aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids,  and gives off a vinegary-odor. It is highly lipid soluble and slightly  soluble in water.</p><p class="depth3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</p><p class="depth3">Mechanism of Action: Aspirin is a more potent inhibitor of both  prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation than other salicylic  acid derivatives. The differences in activity between aspirin and  salicylic acid are thought to be due to the acetyl group on the aspirin  molecule. This acetyl group is responsible for the inactivation of  cyclo-oxygenase via acetylation.</p><p class="depth3">Pharmacokinetics</p><p class="depth3">Absorption: In general, immediate release aspirin is well and  completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Following  absorption, aspirin is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid with peak plasma  levels of salicylic acid occurring within 1-2 hours of dosing (see  Pharmacokinetics--Metabolism). The rate of absorption from the GI tract  is dependent upon the dosage form, the presence or absence of food,  gastric pH (the presence or absence of GI antacids or buffering agents),  and   other physiologic factors. Enteric coated aspirin products are  erratically absorbed from the GI tract.</p><p class="depth3">Distribution: Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues  and fluids in the body including the central nervous system (CNS),  breast milk, and fetal tissues. The highest concentrations are found in  the plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart, and lungs. The protein binding  of salicylate is concentration-dependent, i.e., nonlinear. At low  concentrations (<100 micrograms/milliliter ([micro]g/mL)), approximately  90 percent of plasma salicylate is bound to albumin while at higher  concentrations (400 [micro]g/mL), only about 75 percent is  bound. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including  tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations  approximating 200 [micro]g/mL. Severe toxic effects are associated with  levels 400 [micro]g/mL. (See Adverse Reactions and  Overdosage.)</p><p class="depth3">Metabolism: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in the plasma to salicylic  acid such that plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 1-2  hours after dosing. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver  to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide,  and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylic acid has a plasma half-life  of approximately 6 hours. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total  body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the  limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic  glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10-20 grams (g)), the plasma half- life may be increased to over 20 hours.</p><p class="depth3">Elimination: The elimination of salicylic acid follows zero order  pharmacokinetics; (i.e., the rate of drug elimination is constant in  relation to plasma concentration). Renal excretion of unchanged drug  depends upon urine pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal  clearance of free salicylate increases from <5 percent to 80  percent. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management  of salicylate overdose. (See Overdosage.) Following therapeutic doses,  approximately 10 percent is found excreted in the urine as salicylic  acid, 75 percent as salicyluric acid, and 10 percent phenolic and 5  percent acyl glucuronides of salicylic acid.</p><p class="depth3">Pharmacodynamics Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by  irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts  for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet  aggregating factor thromboxane A2. Nonacetylated salicylates do not  inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on platelet aggregation. At  somewhat higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the formation of  prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin), which is an arterial  vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation.</p><p class="depth3">At higher doses aspirin is an effective anti-inflammatory agent,  partially due to inhibition of inflammatory mediators via cyclo- oxygenase inhibition in peripheral tissues. In vitro studies suggest  that other mediators of inflammation may also be suppressed by aspirin  administration, although the precise mechanism of action has not been  elucidated. It is this nonspecific suppression of cyclo-oxygenase  activity in peripheral tissues following large doses that leads to its  primary side effect of gastric irritation. (See Adverse Reactions.)</p><p class="depth3">CLINICAL STUDIES</p><p class="depth3">Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): In clinical  trials of subjects with TIA's due to fibrin platelet emboli or ischemic  stroke, aspirin has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of the  combined endpoint of stroke or death and the combined endpoint of TIA,  stroke, or death by about 13-18 percent.</p><p class="depth3">Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): In a large, multi-center  study of aspirin, streptokinase, and the combination of aspirin and  streptokinase in 17,187 patients with suspected acute MI, aspirin  treatment produced a 23-percent reduction in the risk of vascular  mortality. Aspirin was also shown to have an additional benefit in  patients given a thrombolytic agent.</p><p class="depth3">Prevention of Recurrent MI and Unstable Angina Pectoris: These  indications are supported by the results of six large, randomized,  multi-center, placebo-controlled trials of predominantly male post-MI  subjects and one randomized placebo-controlled study of men with  unstable angina pectoris. Aspirin therapy in MI subjects was associated  with a significant reduction (about 20 percent) in the risk of the  combined endpoint of subsequent death and/or nonfatal reinfarction in  these patients. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the event  rate was reduced to 5 percent from the 10 percent rate in the placebo  group.</p><p class="depth3">Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris: In a randomized, multi-center,  double-blind trial designed to assess the role of aspirin for prevention  of MI in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, aspirin  significantly reduced the primary combined endpoint of nonfatal MI,  fatal MI, and sudden death by 34 percent. The secondary endpoint for  vascular events (first occurrence of MI, stroke, or vascular death) was  also significantly reduced (32 percent).</p><p class="depth3">Revascularization Procedures: Most patients who undergo coronary  artery revascularization procedures have already had symptomatic  coronary artery disease for which aspirin is indicated. Similarly,  patients with lesions of the carotid bifurcation sufficient to require  carotid endarterectomy   are likely to have had a precedent event. Aspirin is recommended for  patients who undergo revascularization procedures if there is a  preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated.</p><p class="depth3">Rheumatologic Diseases: In clinical studies in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing  spondylitis and osteoarthritis, aspirin has been shown to be effective  in controlling various indices of clinical disease activity.</p><p class="depth3">ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</p><p class="depth3">The acute oral 50 percent lethal dose in rats is about 1.5 g/ kilogram (kg) and in mice 1.1 g/kg. Renal papillary necrosis and  decreased urinary concentrating ability occur in rodents chronically  administered high doses. Dose-dependent gastric mucosal injury occurs in  rats and humans. Mammals may develop aspirin toxicosis associated with  GI symptoms, circulatory effects, and central nervous system depression.  (See Overdosage.)</p><p class="depth3">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</p><p class="depth3">Vascular Indications (Ischemic Stroke, TIA, Acute MI, Prevention of  Recurrent MI, Unstable Angina Pectoris, and Chronic Stable Angina  Pectoris): Aspirin is indicated to: (1) Reduce the combined risk of  death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or  transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, (2)  reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with a suspected acute  MI, (3) reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients  with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris, and (4) reduce the  combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable  angina pectoris.</p><p class="depth3">Revascularization Procedures (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG),  Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), and Carotid  Endarterectomy): Aspirin is indicated in patients who have undergone  revascularization procedures (i.e., CABG, PTCA, or carotid  endarterectomy) when there is a preexisting condition for which aspirin  is already indicated.</p><p class="depth3">Rheumatologic Disease Indications (Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile  Rheumatoid Arthritis, Spondyloarthropathies, Osteoarthritis, and the  Arthritis and Pleurisy of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)): Aspirin  is indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid  arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,  spondyloarthropathies, and arthritis and pleurisy associated with SLE.</p><p class="depth3">CONTRAINDICATIONS</p><p class="depth3">Allergy: Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy  to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products and in patients with the  syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe  urticaria, angioedema, or bronchospasm (asthma).</p><p class="depth3">Reye's Syndrome: Aspirin should not be used in children or teenagers  for viral infections, with or without fever, because of the risk of  Reye's syndrome with concomitant use of aspirin in certain viral  illnesses.</p><p class="depth3">WARNINGS</p><p class="depth3">Alcohol Warning: Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks  every day should be counseled about the bleeding risks involved with  chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.</p><p class="depth3">Coagulation Abnormalities: Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit  platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can  adversely affect patients with inherited (hemophilia) or acquired (liver  disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders.</p><p class="depth3">GI Side Effects: GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn,  nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI  symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during  therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and  bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Physicians should  inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what  steps to take if they occur.</p><p class="depth3">Peptic Ulcer Disease: Patients with a history of active peptic ulcer  disease should avoid using aspirin, which can cause gastric mucosal  irritation and bleeding.</p><p class="depth3">PRECAUTIONS</p><p class="depth3">General</p><p class="depth3">Renal Failure: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure  (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute).</p><p class="depth3">Hepatic Insufficiency: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic  insufficiency.</p><p class="depth3">Sodium Restricted Diets: Patients with sodium-retaining states, such  as congestive heart failure or renal failure, should avoid sodium- containing buffered aspirin preparations because of their high sodium  content.</p><p class="depth3">Laboratory Tests</p><p class="depth3">Aspirin has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes, blood  urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and  prolonged bleeding time.</p><p class="depth3">Drug Interactions</p><p class="depth3">Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: The hyponatremic and  hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the  concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the  renin-angiotensin conversion pathway.</p><p class="depth3">Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead  to high serum   concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the  renal tubule for secretion.</p><p class="depth3">Anticoagulant Therapy (Heparin and Warfarin): Patients on  anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of  drug-drug interactions and the effect on platelets. Aspirin can displace  warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the  prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the  anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk.</p><p class="depth3">Anticonvulsants: Salicylate can displace protein-bound phenytoin and  valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of  phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.</p><p class="depth3">Beta Blockers: The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be  diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to  inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood  flow, and salt and fluid retention.</p><p class="depth3">Diuretics: The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with  underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the  concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal  prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid  retention.</p><p class="depth3">Methotrexate: Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of  methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly  or renal impaired.</p><p class="depth3">Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's): The concurrent use  of aspirin with other NSAID's should be avoided because this may  increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function.</p><p class="depth3">Oral Hypoglycemics: Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the  effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia.</p><p class="depth3">Uricosuric Agents (Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone): Salicylates  antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents.</p><p class="depth3">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Administration  of aspirin for 68 weeks at 0.5 percent in the feed of rats was not  carcinogenic. In the Ames Salmonella assay, aspirin was not mutagenic;  however, aspirin did induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human  fibroblasts. Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats. (See Pregnancy.)</p><p class="depth3">Pregnancy: Pregnant women should only take aspirin if clearly  needed. Because of the known effects of NSAID's on the fetal  cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during the  third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Salicylate products have  also been associated with alterations in maternal and neonatal  hemostasis mechanisms, decreased birth weight, and with perinatal  mortality.</p><p class="depth3">Labor and Delivery: Aspirin should be avoided 1 week prior to and  during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive blood loss  at delivery. Prolonged gestation and prolonged labor due to  prostaglandin inhibition have been reported.</p><p class="depth3">Nursing Mothers: Nursing mothers should avoid using aspirin because  salicylate is excreted in breast milk. Use of high doses may lead to  rashes, platelet abnormalities, and bleeding in nursing infants.</p><p class="depth3">Pediatric Use: Pediatric dosing recommendations for juvenile  rheumatoid arthritis are based on well-controlled clinical studies. An  initial dose of 90-130 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with an increase as  needed for anti-inflammatory efficacy (target plasma salicylate levels  of 150-300 [micro]g/mL) are effective. At high doses (i.e., plasma  levels of greater than 200 [micro]g/mL), the incidence of toxicity  increases.</p><p class="depth3">ADVERSE REACTIONS</p><p class="depth3">Many adverse reactions due to aspirin ingestion are dose-related.  The following is a list of adverse reactions that have been reported in  the literature. (See Warnings.)</p><p class="depth3">Body as a Whole: Fever, hypothermia, thirst.</p><p class="depth3">Cardiovascular: Dysrhythmias, hypotension, tachycardia.</p><p class="depth3">Central Nervous System: Agitation, cerebral edema, coma, confusion,  dizziness, headache, subdural or intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy,  seizures.</p><p class="depth3">Fluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration, hyperkalemia, metabolic  acidosis, respiratory alkalosis.</p><p class="depth3">Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, GI bleeding, ulceration and  perforation, nausea, vomiting, transient elevations of hepatic enzymes,  hepatitis, Reye's Syndrome, pancreatitis.</p><p class="depth3">Hematologic: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated  intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia.</p><p class="depth3">Hypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma,  bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, urticaria.</p><p class="depth3">Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis.</p><p class="depth3">Metabolism: Hypoglycemia (in children), hyperglycemia.</p><p class="depth3">Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower  birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding.</p><p class="depth3">Respiratory: Hyperpnea, pulmonary edema, tachypnea.</p><p class="depth3">Special Senses: Hearing loss, tinnitus. Patients with high frequency  hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients,  tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism.</p><p class="depth3">Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria,  renal insufficiency and failure.</p><p class="depth3">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</p><p class="depth3">Aspirin is nonnarcotic. There is no known potential for addiction  associated with the use of aspirin.</p><p class="depth3">OVERDOSAGE</p><p class="depth3">Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or  chronic intoxication. The early signs of salicylic overdose  (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma  concentrations approaching 200 [micro]g/mL. Plasma concentrations of  aspirin above 300 [micro]g/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects  are associated with levels above 400 [micro]g/mL. (See Clinical  Pharmacology.) A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known  with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected  overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.  Careful medical management is essential.</p><p class="depth3">Signs and Symptoms: In acute overdose, severe acid-base and  electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia  and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while  hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic  acidosis.</p><p class="depth3">Treatment: Treatment consists primarily of supporting vital  functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid- base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon  as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited  spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated  charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed  since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to  emesis and lavage.</p><p class="depth3">Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the  blood salicylate level. Acid-base status should be closely followed with  serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Fluid and electrolyte  balance should also be maintained.</p><p class="depth3">In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major  immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water.  Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented  with correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be  monitored to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function  is normal. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.</p><p class="depth3">Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the  body drug content. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of  life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required. Exchange  transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.</p><p class="depth3">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</p><p class="depth3">Each dose of aspirin should be taken with a full glass of water  unless patient is fluid restricted. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic  dosages should be individualized. When aspirin is used in high doses,  the development of tinnitus may be used as a clinical sign of elevated  plasma salicylate levels except in patients with high frequency hearing  loss.</p><p class="depth3">Ischemic Stroke and TIA: 50-325 mg once a day. Continue therapy  indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">Suspected Acute MI: The initial dose of 160-162.5 mg is administered  as soon as an MI is suspected. The maintenance dose of 160-162.5 mg a  day is continued for 30 days post-infarction. After 30 days, consider  further therapy based on dosage and administration for prevention of  recurrent MI.</p><p class="depth3">Prevention of Recurrent MI: 75-325 mg once a day. Continue therapy  indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">Unstable Angina Pectoris: 75-325 mg once a day. Continue therapy  indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris: 75-325 mg once a day. Continue  therapy indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">CABG: 325 mg daily starting 6 hours post-procedure. Continue therapy  for 1 year post-procedure.</p><p class="depth3">PTCA: The initial dose of 325 mg should be given 2 hours pre- surgery. Maintenance dose is 160-325 mg daily. Continue therapy  indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">Carotid Endarterectomy: Doses of 80 mg once daily to 650 mg twice  daily, started presurgery, are recommended. Continue therapy  indefinitely.</p><p class="depth3">Rheumatoid Arthritis: The initial dose is 3 g a day in divided  doses. Increase as needed for anti-inflammatory efficacy with target  plasma salicylate levels of 150-300 [micro]g/mL. At high doses (i.e.,  plasma levels of greater than 200 [micro]g/mL), the incidence of  toxicity increases.</p><p class="depth3">Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: Initial dose is 90-130 mg/kg/day in  divided doses. Increase as needed for anti-inflammatory efficacy with  target plasma salicylate levels of 150-300 [micro]g/mL. At high doses  (i.e., plasma levels of greater than 200 [micro]g/mL), the incidence of  toxicity increases.</p><p class="depth3">Spondyloarthropathies: Up to 4 g per day in divided doses.</p><p class="depth3">Osteoarthritis: Up to 3 g per day in divided doses.</p><p class="depth3">Arthritis and Pleurisy of SLE: The initial dose is 3 g a day in  divided doses. Increase as needed for anti-inflammatory efficacy with  target plasma salicylate levels of 150-300 [micro]g/mL. At high doses  (i.e., plasma levels of greater than 200 m[micro]/mL), the incidence of  toxicity increases.</p><p class="depth3">HOW SUPPLIED</p><p class="depth3">(Insert specific information regarding, strength of dosage form,  units in which the dosage form is generally available, and information  to facilitate identification of the dosage form as required under Sec.  201.57(k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(3).)
