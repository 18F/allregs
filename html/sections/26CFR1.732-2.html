                                Sec. 1.732-2  Special partnership basis of distributed property.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adjustments under section 734(b). In the case of a distribution  of property to a partner, the partnership bases of the distributed  properties shall reflect any increases or decreases to the basis of  partnership property which have been made previously under section  734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to basis of undistributed  partnership property) in connection with previous distributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. Partner D acquired his interest in partnership ABD from a  previous partner. Since the partnership had made an election under  section 754, a special basis adjustment with respect to D is applicable  to the basis of partnership property in accordance with section 743(b).  One of the assets of the partnership at the time D acquired his interest  was property X, which is later distributed to D in a current  distribution. Property X has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  $1,000 and with respect to D it has a special basis adjustment of $500.  Therefore, for purposes of section 732(a)(1), the adjusted basis of such  property to the partnership with respect to D immediately before its  distribution is $1,500. However, if property X is distributed to partner  A, a nontransferee partner, its adjusted basis to the partnership for  purposes of section 732(a)(1) is only $1,000. In such case, D's $500  special basis adjustment may shift over to other property. See Sec.  1.743-1(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments to basis of distributed inventory and unrealized  receivables. Under section 732, the basis to be allocated to distributed  properties shall be allocated first to any unrealized receivables and  inventory items. If the distributee partner is a transferee of a  partnership interest and has a special basis adjustment for unrealized  receivables or inventory items under either section 743(b) or section  732(d), then the partnership adjusted basis immediately prior to  distribution of any unrealized receivables or inventory items  distributed to such partner shall be determined as follows: If the  distributee partner receives his entire share of the fair market value  of the inventory items or unrealized receivables of the partnership, the  adjusted basis of such distributed property to the partnership, for the  purposes of section 732, shall take into account the entire amount of  any special basis adjustment which the distributee partner may have for  such assets. If the distributee partner receives less than his entire  share of the fair market value of partnership inventory items or  unrealized receivables, then, for purposes of section 732, the adjusted  basis of such distributed property to the partnership shall take into  account the same proportion of the distributee's special basis  adjustment for unrealized receivables or inventory items as the value of  such items distributed to him bears to his entire share of the total  value of all such items of the partnership. The provisions of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. Partner C acquired his 40-percent interest in partnership  AC from a previous partner. Since the partnership had made an election  under section 754, C has a special basis adjustment to partnership  property under section 743(b). C retires from the partnership when the  adjusted basis of his partnership interest is $3,000. He receives from  the partnership in liquidation of his entire interest, $1,000 cash,  certain capital assets, depreciable property, and certain inventory  items and unrealized receivables. C has a special basis adjustment of  $800 with respect to partnership inventory items and of $200 with  respect to unrealized receivables. The common partnership basis for the  inventory items distributed to him is $500 and for the unrealized  receivables is zero. If the value of inventory items and the unrealized  receivables distributed to C in his 40 percent share   of the total value of all partnership inventory items and unrealized  receivables, then, for purposes of section 732, the adjusted basis of  such property in C's hands will be $1,300 for the inventory items ($500  plus $800) and $200 for the unrealized receivables (zero plus $200). The  remaining basis of $500, which constitutes the basis of the capital  assets and depreciable property distributed to C, is determined as  follows: $3,000 (total basis) less $1,000 cash, or $2,000 (the amount to  be allocated to the basis of all distributed property), less $1,500  ($800 and $200 special basis adjustments, plus $500 common partnership  basis, the amount allocated to inventory items and unrealized  receivables). However, if the value of the inventory items and  unrealized receivables distributed to C consisted of only 20 percent of  the total fair market value of such property (i. e., only one-half of  C's 40-percent share), then only one-half of C's special basis  adjustment of $800 for partnership inventory items and $200 for  unrealized receivables would be taken into account. In that case, the  basis of the inventory items in C's hands would be $650 ($250, the  common partnership basis for inventory items distributed to him, plus  $400, one-half of C's special basis adjustment for inventory items). The  basis of the unrealized receivables in C's hands would be $100 (zero  plus $100, one-half of C's special basis adjustment for unrealized  receivables).  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8847, 64 FR 69908, Dec. 15, 1999]</p>
