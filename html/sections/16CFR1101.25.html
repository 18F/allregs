                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice to manufacturer or private labeler. In accordance with  section 6(b)(2) of the CPSA, if the Commission, after following the  notice provisions of section 6(b)(1), determines that information  claimed to be inaccurate by a manufacturer or private labeler in  comments submitted under section 6(b)(1) should be disclosed because the  Commission believes it has complied with section 6(b)(1), the Commission  shall notify the manufacturer or private labeler that it intends to  disclose the information not less than 5 days after the date of the  receipt of notification by the firm. The notice of intent to disclose  will include an explanation of the reason for the Commission's decision,  copies of any additional materials, such as explanatory statements and  letters to Freedom of Information Act requesters, which were not  previously sent to the firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commission finding a lesser period is required. The Commission  may determine that the public health and safety requires less than 5  days advance notice of its intent to disclose information claimed to be  inaccurate. For example, the Commission may determine it is necessary to  warn the public quickly because individuals may be in danger from a  product hazard or a potential hazard, or to correct product safety  information released by third persons, which mischaracterized statements  made by the Commission about the product or which attributes to the  Commission statements about the product which the Commission did not  make.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of findings. The Commission will inform a manufacturer or  private labeler of a product which is the subject of a public health and  safety finding that the public health and safety requires less than 5  days advance notice either orally or in writing, depending on the  immediacy of the need for quick action.
