                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The label of any package of a food which bears a representation  as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in  immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as  is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of  weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such  statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in  the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example,  cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to  cookery and describes a constant quantity. Such statement may not be  misleading in any particular. A statement of the number of units in a  package is not in itself a statement of the number of servings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated  pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10 by the Department of  Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term serving with  respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the  number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such  quantitative definition. (Copies of published standards are available  upon request from the National Bureau of Standards, Department of  Commerce, Washington, DC 20234.)</p>
