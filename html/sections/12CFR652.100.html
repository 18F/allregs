Appendix A provides details about the risk-based capital stress  test (stress test) for Farmer Mac. The stress test calculates the risk- based capital level required by statute under stipulated conditions of  credit risk and interest rate risk. The stress test uses loan-level data  from Farmer Mac's agricultural mortgage portfolio or proxy data as  described in section 4.1 d.(3) below, as well as quarterly Call Report  and related information to generate pro forma financial statements and  calculate a risk-based capital requirement. The stress test also uses  historic   agricultural real estate mortgage performance data, rural utility  guarantee fees, relevant economic variables, and other inputs in its  calculations of Farmer Mac's capital needs over a 10-year period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Appendix A establishes the requirements for all components of the  stress test. The key components of the stress test are: Specifications  of credit risk, interest rate risk, the cashflow generator, and the  capital calculation. Linkages among the components ensure that the  measures of credit and interest rate risk pass into the cashflow  generator. The linkages also transfer cashflows through the financial  statements to represent values of assets, liabilities, and equity  capital. The 10-year projection is designed to reflect a steady state in  the scope and composition of Farmer Mac's assets.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Credit Risk</p><p class="depth0">Loan loss rates are determined by applying the loss-frequency  equation and the loss-severity factor to Farmer Mac loan-level data.  Using this equation and severity factor, you must calculate loan losses  under stressful economic conditions assuming Farmer Mac's portfolio  remains at a ``steady state.'' Steady state assumes the underlying  characteristics and risks of Farmer Mac's portfolio remain constant over  the 10 years of the stress test. Loss rates discussed in this section  apply to all loans, unless otherwise indicated. Loss rates are computed  from estimated dollar losses for use in the stress test. The loan volume  subject to loss throughout the stress test is then multiplied by the  loss rate. Lastly, the stress test allocates losses to each of the 10  years assuming a time pattern for loss occurrence as discussed in  section 4.3, ``Risk Measures.''</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Loss-Frequency and Loss-Severity Models for All Types of Loans,</p><p class="depth0">Except Rural Utility Loans</p><p class="depth0">a. Credit risks are modeled in the stress test using historical time  series loan-level data to measure the frequency and severity of losses  on agricultural mortgage loans. The model relates loss frequency and  severity to loan-level characteristics and economic conditions through  appropriately specified regression equations to account explicitly for  the effects of these characteristics on loan losses. Loan losses for  Farmer Mac are estimated from the resulting loss-frequency equation  combined with the loss-severity factor by substituting the respective  values of Farmer Mac's loan-level data or proxy data as described in  section 4.1 d.(3) below, and applying stressful economic inputs.</p><p class="depth0">b. The loss-frequency equation and loss-severity factor were  estimated from historical agricultural real estate mortgage loan data  from the Farm Credit Bank of Texas (FCBT). Due to Farmer Mac's  relatively short history, its own loan-level data are insufficiently  developed for use in estimating the default frequency equation and loss- severity factor. In the future, however, expansions in both the scope  and historic length of Farmer Mac's lending operations may support the  use of its data in estimating the relationships.</p><p class="depth0">c. To estimate the equations, the data used included FCBT loans,  which satisfied three of the four underwriting standards Farmer Mac  currently uses (estimation data). The four standards specify: (1) The  debt-to-assets ratio (D/A) must be less than 0.50, (2) the loan-to-value  ratio (LTV) must be less than 0.70, (3) the debt-service-coverage ratio  (DSCR) must exceed 1.25, (4) and the current ratio (current assets  divided by current liabilities) must exceed 1.0. Furthermore, the D/A  and LTV ratios were restricted to be less than or equal to 0.85.</p><p class="depth0">d. Several limitations in the FCBT loan-level data affect  construction of the loss-frequency equation. The data contained loans  that were originated between 1979 and 1992, but there were virtually no  losses during the early years of the sample period. As a result, losses  attributable to specific loans are only available from 1986 through  1992. In addition, no prepayment information was available in the data.</p><p class="depth0">e. The FCBT data used for estimation also included as performing  loans, those loans that were re-amortized, paid in full, or merged with  a new loan. Including these loans may lead to an understatement of loss- frequency probabilities if some of the re-amortized, paid, or merged  loans experience default or incur losses. In contrast, when the loans  that are re-amortized, paid in full, or merged are excluded from the  analysis, the loss-frequency rates are overstated if a higher proportion  of loans that are re-amortized, paid in full, or combined (merged) into  a new loan are non-default loans compared to live loans. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Excluding loans with defaults, 11,527 loans were active and  7,515 loans were paid in full, re-amortized or merged as of 1992. A t- test \2\ of the differences in the means for the group of defaulted  loans and active loans indicated that active loans had significantly  higher D/A and LTV ratios, and lower current ratios than defaulted loans  where loss occurred. These results indicate that, on average, active  loans have potentially higher risk than loans that were re-amortized,  paid in full, or merged. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">f. The structure of the historical FCBT data supports estimation of  loss frequency based on origination information and economic conditions.  Under an origination year approach, each observation is used only once  in estimating loan default. The underwriting   variables at origination and economic factors occurring over the life of  the loan are then used to estimate loan-loss frequency.</p><p class="depth0">g. The final loss-frequency equation is based on origination year  data and represents a lifetime loss-frequency model. The final equation  for loss frequency is:  p = 1/(1+exp(-(BX))  Where:  BX = (-12.62738) + 1.91259 [middot] X1 + (-0.33830) [middot]</p><p class="depth0">X2 / (1 + 0.0413299)Periods + (-0.19596)</p><p class="depth0">[middot] X3 + 4.55390 [middot] (1-exp((-0.00538178)</p><p class="depth0">[middot] X4) + 2.49482 [middot] X5  Where:</p><p class="depth0">p is the probability that a loan defaults and has positive</p><p class="depth0">losses (Pr (Y=1 [bond] x));</p><p class="depth0">X1 is the LTV ratio at loan origination raised to</p><p class="depth0">the power 5.3914596; \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Loss probability is likely to be more sensitive to changes in  LTV at higher values of LTV.

The estimated logit coefficients and p-values are: \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ The nonlinear parameters for the variable transformations were  simultaneously estimated using SAS version 8e NLIN procedure. The NLIN  procedure produces estimates of the parameters of a nonlinear  transformation for LTV, dampening factor, and loan-size variables. To  implement the NLIN procedure, the loss-frequency equation and its  variables are declared and initial parameter values supplied. The NLIN  procedure is an iterative process that uses the initial parameter values  as the starting values for the first iteration and continues to iterate  until acceptable parameters are solved. The initial values for the power  function and dampening function are based on the proposed rule. The  procedure for the initial values for the size variable parameter is  provided in an Excel spreadsheet posted at http://www.fca.gov. The  Gauss-Newton method is the selected iterative solving process. As  described in the preamble, the loss-frequency function for the nonlinear  model is the negative of the log-likelihood function, thus producing  maximum likelihood estimates. In order to obtain statistical properties  for the loss-frequency equation and verify the logistic coefficients,  the estimates for the nonlinear transformations are applied to the FCBT  data and the loss-frequency model is re-estimated using the SAS Logistic  procedure. The SAS procedures, output reports and Excel spreadsheet used  to estimate the parameters of the loss-frequency equation are located on  the Web site http://www.fca.gov.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Coefficients       p-value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Intercept...............................       -12.62738         <0.0001 X1: LTV variable........................         1.91259          0.0001 X2: Max land value decline variable.....         0.33830         <0.0001 X3: DSCR................................        -0.19596          0.0002 X4: Loan size variable..................         4.55390         <0.0001 X5: D/A ratio...........................         2.49482         <0.0000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">i.

These variables have logical relationships to the incidence of  loan default and loss, as evidenced by the findings of numerous credit- scoring studies in agricultural finance. \5\ Each of the variable  coefficients has directional relationships that appropriately capture  credit risk from underwriting variables and, therefore, the incidence of  loan-loss frequency. The frequency of loan loss was found to differ  significantly across all of the loan characteristics and lending  conditions. Farmland values represent an appropriate variable for  capturing the effects of exogenous economic factors. It is commonly  accepted that farmland values at any point in time reflect the  discounted present value   of expected returns to the land. \6\ Thus, changes in land values, as  expressed in the loss-frequency equation, represent the combined effects  of the level and growth rates of farm income, interest rates, and  inflationary expectations--each of which is accounted for in the  discounted, present value process. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Splett, N.S., P.

When applying the equation to Farmer Mac's portfolio, you must  get the input values for X1, X3, X4,  and X5 for each loan in Farmer Mac's portfolio on the date at  which the stress test is conducted, using either submitted data or proxy  data as described in section 4.1 d.(3) below. For the variable  X2, the stressful input value from the benchmark loss  experience is -23.52 percent. You must apply this input to all Farmer  Mac loans subject to loss to calculate loss frequency under stressful  economic conditions. \7\ The maximum land value decline from the  benchmark loss experience is the simple average of annual land value  changes for Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota for the years 1984 and 1985.  \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ On- and off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I agricultural mortgage  program assets booked after the 1996 Act amendments are subject to the  loss calculation.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ While the worst-case losses, based on origination year, occurred  during 1983 and 1984, this benchmark was determined using annual land  value changes that occurred 2 years later. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">l. Forecasting with data outside the range of the estimation data  requires special treatment for implementation. While the estimation data  embody Farmer Mac values for various loan characteristics, the maximum  farmland price decline experienced in Texas was -16.69 percent, a value  below the benchmark experience of -23.52 percent. To control for this  effect, you must apply a procedure that restricts the slope of all the  independent variables to that observed at the maximum land value decline  observed in the estimation data. Essentially, you must approximate the  slope of the loss-frequency equation at the point -16.69 percent in  order to adjust the probability of loan default and loss occurrence for  data beyond the range in the estimating data. The adjustment procedure  is shown in step 4 of section 2.3 entitled, ``Example Calculation of  Dollar Loss on One Loan.''</p><p class="depth0">m. Loss severity was not found to vary systematically and was  considered constant across the tested loan characteristics and lending  conditions. Thus, the simple weighted average by loss volume of 20.9  percent is used in the stress test. \9\ You must multiply loss severity  with the probability estimate computed from the loss-frequency equation  to determine the loss rate for a loan. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\9\ We calculated the weighted-average loss severity from the  estimation data. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">n. Using original loan balance results in estimated probabilities of  loss frequency over the entire life of a loan. To account for loan  seasoning, you must reduce the loan-loss exposure by the cumulative  probability of loss already experienced by each loan as discussed in  section 2.2 entitled, ``Loan-Seasoning Adjustment.'' This subtraction is  based on loan age and reduces the loss estimated by the loss-frequency  and loss-severity equations. The result is an age-adjusted lifetime  dollar loss that can be used in subsequent calculations of loss rates as  discussed in section 2.4, ``Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the  Stress Test.''</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Loan-Seasoning Adjustment for All Types of Loans, Except Rural</p><p class="depth0">Utility Loans</p><p class="depth0">a. You must use the seasoning function supplied by FCA to adjust the  calculated probability of loss for each Farmer Mac loan for the  cumulative loss exposure already experienced based on the age of each  loan. The seasoning function is based on the same data used to determine  the loss-frequency equation and an assumed average life of 14 years for  agricultural mortgages. If we determine that the relationship between  the loss experience in Farmer Mac's portfolio over time and the  seasoning function can be improved, we may augment or replace the  seasoning function.</p><p class="depth0">b. The seasoning function is parameterized as a beta distribution  with parameters of p = 4.288 and q = 5.3185. \10\ How the loan-seasoning  distribution is used is shown in Step 7 of section 2.3, ``Example  Calculation of Dollar Loss on One Loan.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ We estimated the loan-seasoning distribution from portfolio  aggregate charge-off rates from the estimation data. To do so, we  arrayed all defaulting loans where loss occurred according to the time  from origination to default. Then, a beta distribution, b(p, q), was fit  to the estimation data scaled to the maximum time a loan survived (14  years). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Example Calculation of Dollar Loss on One Loan for All Types of</p><p class="depth0">Loans, Except Rural Utility Loans</p><p class="depth0">Here is an example of the calculation of the dollar losses for an  individual loan with the following characteristics and input values:  \11\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ In the examples presented we rounded the numbers, but the  example calculation is based on a larger number of significant digits.

Subtract the total dollars  of contractually required overcollateral from the adjusted total losses  on the subject pool. If the result is less than or equal to zero, input  a loss rate of zero for this transaction pool in the Data Inputs  worksheet of the RBCST. A new category must be created for each such  transaction in the RBCST. If the loss rate after subtracting  contractually required overcollateral is greater than zero, proceed to  additional adjustment for the risk-reducing effects of the  counterparty's general obligation described in ``3.'' below.</p><p class="depth0">3. Loans with a positive loss estimate remaining after adjustments  in ``1.'' and ``2.'' above are further adjusted for the security  provided by the general obligation of the counterparty. To make this  adjustment in our example, multiply the estimated dollar losses  remaining after adjustments in ``1.'' and ``2.'' above by the  appropriate general obligation adjustment (GOA) factor based on the  counterparty's whole-letter issuer credit rating by a nationally  recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and the ratio of the  counterparty's concentration of risk in the same industry sector as the  loans backing the AgVantage Plus volume, as determined by the Director.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Director will make final determinations of concentration  ratios on a case-by-case basis by using publicly reported data on  counterparty portfolios, non-public data submitted and certified by  Farmer Mac as part of its RBCST submissions, and will generally  recognize rural electric cooperatives and rural telephone cooperatives  as separate rural utility sectors. The following table sets forth the  GOA factors and their components by whole-letter credit rating  (Adjustment Factor = Default Rate x Severity Rate x 3), which may be  further adjusted for industry sector concentration by the Director.\15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ Emery, K., Ou S., Tennant, J., Kim F., Cantor R., ``Corporate  Default and Recovery Rates, 1920--2007,'' published by Moody's Investors  Service, February 2008--the most recent edition as of March 2008;  Default Rates, page 24, Recovery Rates (Severity Rate = 1 minus Senior  Unsecured Average Recovery Rate) page 20.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A                                    B               C               D               E               F               G --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Factor with</p><p class="depth0">V3.0 GOA        V4.0 GOA      Concentration   concentration</p><p class="depth0">Whole-letter rating                     Default rate    Severity rate      factor       factors (D x    ratio (e.g.,    adjustment 1-</p><p class="depth0"><em>(percent)</em>       (percent)       (percent)     3) (percent)   25%) (percent)   ((1-E) x (1-</p><p class="depth0">F)) (percent) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AAA.....................................................           0.897              54            0.48            1.41           25.00           26.06 AA......................................................           2.294              54            1.24            3.70           25.00           27.78</p><p class="depth0">A.......................................................           2.901              54            1.57            5.13           25.00           28.84 BBB.....................................................           7.061              54            3.82           11.48           25.00           33.61 Below BBB and Unrated...................................          26.827              54           14.50           44.52           25.00           58.39 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">B.

Continuing the previous example, the pool contains two loans on  which Farmer Mac is guaranteeing a total of $2 million and with total  submitted collateral of 110 percent of the guaranteed amount. Of the 10- percent total overcollateral, 5 percent is contractually required under  the terms of the transaction. The pool consists of two loans of slightly  over $1 million. Total overcollateral is $200,000 of which $100,000 is  contractually required. The counterparty has a single ``A'' credit  rating, a 25-percent concentration ratio, and after adjusting for  contractually required overcollateral, estimated losses are greater than  zero.

[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the Stress Test for All Types</p><p class="depth0">of Loans, Except Rural Utility Loans</p><p class="depth0">a. You must compute the loss rates by state as the dollar weighted  average seasoned loss rates from the Cash Window and Standby loan  portfolios by state. The spreadsheet entitled, ``Credit Loss  Module.XLS'' can be used for these calculations. This spreadsheet is  available for download on our Web site, www.fca.gov, or will be provided  upon request. The blended loss rates for each state are copied from the  ``Credit Loss Module'' to the stress test spreadsheet for determining  Farmer Mac's regulatory capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0">b. The stress test use of the blended loss rates is further  discussed in section 4.3, ``Risk Measures.''</p><p class="depth0">2.6 Calculation of Loss Rates on Rural Utility Volume for-Use in the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test</p><p class="depth0">You must submit the outstanding principal, maturity date of the  loan, maturity date of the AgVantage Plus contract (if applicable), and  the rural utility guarantee fee percentage for each loan in Farmer Mac's  rural utility loan portfolio on the date at which the stress test is  conducted. You must multiply the rural utility guarantee fee by two to  calculate the loss rate on rural utility   loans under stressful economic conditions and then multiply the loss  rate by the total outstanding principal. To arrive at the net rural  utility loan losses, you must next apply the steps ``5'' through ``11''  of section 2.4.b.4 of this Appendix. For loans under an AgVantage Plus- type structure, the calculated losses are distributed over time on a  straight-line basis. For loans that are not part of an AgVantage Plus- type structure, losses are distributed over the 10-year modeling  horizon, consistent with other non-AgVantage Plus loan volume.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Interest Rate Risk</p><p class="depth0">The stress test explicitly accounts for Farmer Mac's vulnerability  to interest rate risk from the movement in interest rates specified in  the statute. The stress test considers Farmer Mac's interest rate risk  position through the current structure of its balance sheet, reported  interest rate risk shock-test results, \16\ and other financial  activities. The stress test calculates the effect of interest rate risk  exposure through market value changes of interest-bearing assets,  liabilities, and off-balance sheet transactions, and thereby the effects  to equity capital. The stress test also captures this exposure through  the cashflows on rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. We discuss how  to calculate the dollar impact of interest rate risk in section 4.6,  ``Balance Sheets.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\16\ See paragraph c. of section 4.1 entitled, ``Data Inputs,'' for  a description of the interest rate risk shock-reporting requirement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Process for Calculating the Interest Rate Movement</p><p class="depth0">a. The stress test uses the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury (10- year CMT) released by the Federal Reserve in HR. 15, ``Selected Interest  Rates.'' The stress test uses the 10-year CMT to generate earnings  yields on assets, expense rates on liabilities, and changes in the  market value of assets and liabilities. For stress test purposes, the  starting rate for the 10-year CMT is the 3-month average of the most  recent monthly rate series published by the Federal Reserve. The 3-month  average is calculated by summing the latest monthly series of the 10- year CMT and dividing by three. For instance, you would calculate the  initial rate on June 30, 1999, as:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">10-year</p><p class="depth0">CMT</p><p class="depth0">Month end                             monthly</p><p class="depth0">series ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 04/1999......................................................       5.18 05/1999......................................................       5.54 06/1999......................................................       5.90 Average......................................................       5.54 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">b. The amount by which the stress test shocks the initial rate up  and down is determined by calculating the 12-month average of the 10- year CMT monthly series. If the resulting average is less than 12  percent, the stress test shocks the initial rate by an amount determined  by multiplying the 12-month average rate by 50 percent. However, if the  average is greater than or equal to 12 percent, the stress test shocks  the initial rate by 600 basis points. For example, determine the amount  by which to increase and decrease the initial rate for June 30, 1999, as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">10-year</p><p class="depth0">CMT</p><p class="depth0">Month end                             monthly</p><p class="depth0">series ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 07/1998......................................................       5.46 08/1998......................................................       5.34 09/1998......................................................       4.81 10/1998......................................................       4.53 11/1998......................................................       4.83 12/1998......................................................       4.65 01/1999......................................................       4.72 02/1999......................................................       5.00 03/1999......................................................       5.23 04/1999......................................................       5.18 05/1999......................................................       5.54 06/1999......................................................       5.90 12-Month Average.............................................       5.10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Calculation of shock amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12-Month Average Less than 12%................  Yes. 12-Month Average..............................  5.10. Multiply the 12-Month Average by..............  50%. Shock in basis points equals..................  255. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. You must run the stress test for two separate changes in interest  rates: (i) An immediate increase in the initial rate by the shock  amount; and (ii) immediate decrease in the initial rate by the shock  amount. The stress test then holds the changed interest rate constant  for the remainder of the 10-year stress period. For example, at June 30,  1999, the stress test would be run for an immediate and sustained (for  10 years) upward movement in interest rates to 8.09 percent (5.54  percent plus 255 basis points) and also for an immediate and sustained  (for 10 years) downward movement in interest rates to 2.99 percent (5.54  percent minus 255 basis points). The movement in interest rates that  results in the greatest need for capital is then used to determine  Farmer Mac's risk-based capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Elements Used in Generating Cashflows</p><p class="depth0">a. This section describes the elements that are required for  implementation of the stress test and assessment of Farmer Mac capital  performance through time. An Excel spreadsheet named FAMC RBCST,  available at http://www.fca.gov, contains the stress test, including the  cashflow generator. The spreadsheet contains the following seven  worksheets:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data Input;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assumptions and Relationships;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk Measures (credit risk and interest rate risk);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Loan and Cash Flow Accounts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income Statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Balance Sheets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Capital.</p><p class="depth0">b. Each of the components is described in further detail below with  references where appropriate to the specific worksheets within the Excel  spreadsheet. The stress test may be generally described as a set of  linked financial statements that evolve over a period of 10 years using  generally accepted accounting conventions and specified sets of stressed  inputs. The stress test uses the initial financial condition of Farmer  Mac, including earnings and funding relationships, and the credit and  interest rate stressed inputs to calculate Farmer Mac's capital  performance through time. The stress test then subjects the initial  financial conditions to the first period set of credit and interest rate  risk stresses, generates cashflows by asset and liability category,  performs necessary accounting postings into relevant accounts, and  generates an income statement associated with the first interval of  time. The stress test then uses the income statement to update the  balance sheet for the end of period 1 (beginning of period 2). All  necessary capital calculations for that point in time are then  performed.</p><p class="depth0">c. The beginning of the period 2 balance sheet then serves as the  departure point for the second income cycle. The second period's  cashflows and resulting income statement are generated in similar  fashion as the first period's except all inputs (i.e., the periodic loan  losses, portfolio balance by category, and liability balances) are  updated appropriately to reflect conditions at that point in time. The  process evolves forward for a period of 10 years with each pair of  balance sheets linked by an intervening set of cashflow and income  statements. In this and the following sections, additional details are  provided about the specification of the income-generating model to be  used by Farmer Mac in calculating the risk-based capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Data Inputs</p><p class="depth0">The stress test requires the initial financial statement conditions  and income generating relationships for Farmer Mac. The worksheet named  ``Data Inputs'' contains the complete data inputs and the data form used  in the stress test. The stress test uses these data and various  assumptions to calculate pro forma financial statements. For stress test  purposes, Farmer Mac is required to supply:</p><p class="depth0">a. Call Report Schedules RC: Balance Sheet and RI: Income Statement.  These schedules form the starting financial position for the stress  test. In addition, the stress test calculates basic financial  relationships and assumptions used in generating pro forma annual  financial statements over the 10-year stress period. Financial  relationships and assumptions are in section 4.2, ``Assumptions and  Relationships.''</p><p class="depth0">b. Cashflow Data for Asset and Liability Account Categories. The  necessary cashflow data for the spreadsheet-based stress test are book  value, weighted average yield, weighted average maturity, conditional  prepayment rate, weighted average amortization, and weighted average  guarantee fees and rural utility guarantee fees. The spreadsheet uses  this cashflow information to generate starting and ending account  balances, interest earnings, guarantee fees, rural utility guarantee  fees, and interest expense. Each asset and liability account category  identified in this data requirement is discussed in section 4.2  ``Assumptions and Relationships.''</p><p class="depth0">c. Interest Rate Risk Measurement Results. The stress test uses the  results from Farmer Mac's interest rate risk model to represent changes  in the market value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet  positions during upward and downward instantaneous shocks in interest  rates of 300, 250, 200, 150, and 100 basis points. The stress test uses  these data to calculate a schedule of estimated effective durations  representing the market value effects from a change in interest rates.  The stress test uses a linear interpolation of the duration schedule to  relate a change in interest rates to a change in the market value of  equity. This calculation is described in section 4.4 entitled, ``Loan  and Cashflow Accounts,'' and is illustrated in the referenced worksheet  of the stress test.</p><p class="depth0">d. Loan-Level Data for all Farmer Mac I Program Assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The stress test requires loan-level data for all Farmer Mac I  program assets to determine lifetime age-adjusted loss rates. The  specific loan data fields required for running the credit risk component  are:</p><p class="depth0">Farmer Mac I Program Loan Data Fields  Loan Number Ending Scheduled Balance Group Pre/Post Act Property State Product Type Origination Date Loan Cutoff Date Original Loan Balance Original Scheduled P&I; Original Appraised Value Loan-to-Value Ratio Debt-to-Assets Ratio Current Assets Current Liabilities Total Assets Total Liabilities Gross Farm Revenue   Net Farm Income Depreciation Interest on Capital Debt Capital Lease Payments Living Expenses Income & FICA Taxes Net Off-Farm Income Total Debt Service Guarantee/Commitment Fee Seasoned Loan Flag</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> From the loan-level data, you must identify the geographic  distribution by state of Farmer Mac's loan portfolio and enter the  current loan balance for each state in the ``Data Inputs'' worksheet.

Loan-Level Data for All Rural Utility Program Volume. The stress  test requires loan-level data for all rural utility program volume. The  specific loan data fields required for calculating the credit risk are  outstanding principal, maturity date of the loan, maturity date of the  AgVantage Plus contract (if applicable), and the rural utility guarantee  fee percentage for each loan in Farmer Mac's rural utility loan  portfolio on the date at which the stress test is conducted.</p><p class="depth0">f. Weighted Haircuts for Non-Program Investments. For non-program  investments, the stress test adjusts the weighted average yield data  referenced in section 4.1.b. to reflect counterparty risk.

If portions of investments are later sold by Farmer Mac according  to their specific risk characteristics, the Director will take  reasonable measures to adjust the haircut level applied to the  investment to recognize the change in the risk characteristics of the  retained portion. The Director will consider relevant similar methods  for dealing with capital requirements adopted by other Federal financial  institution regulators in similar situations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Individual investment haircuts must then be aggregated into  weighted-average haircuts by investment category and submitted in the  ``Data Inputs'' worksheet. The spreadsheet uses these inputs to reduce  the weighted-average yield on the investment category to account for  counterparty insolvency according to a 10-year linear phase-in of the  haircuts. Each asset account category identified in this data  requirement is discussed in section 4.2, ``Assumptions and  Relationships.''</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Assumptions and Relationships</p><p class="depth0">a. The stress test assumptions are summarized on the worksheet  called ``Assumptions and Relationships.'' Some of the entries on this  page are direct user entries. Other entries are relationships generated  from data supplied by Farmer Mac or other sources as discussed in  section 4.1, ``Data Inputs.'' After current financial data are entered,  the user selects the date for running the stress test. This action  causes the stress test to identify and select the appropriate data from  the ``Data Inputs'' worksheet. The next section highlights the degree of  disaggregation needed to maintain reasonably representative financial  characterizations of Farmer Mac in the stress test. Several specific  assumptions are established about the future relationships of account  balances and how they evolve.</p><p class="depth0">b. From the data and assumptions, the stress test computes pro forma  financial statements for 10 years. The stress test must   be run as a ``steady state'' with regard to program balances (with the  exception of AgVantage Plus volume, in which case maturities are  recognized by the model), and where possible, will use information  gleaned from recent financial statements and other data supplied by  Farmer Mac to establish earnings and cost relationships on major program  assets that are applied forward in time. As documented in the stress  test, entries of ``1'' imply no growth and/or no change in account  balances or proportions relative to initial conditions with the  exception of pre-1996 loan volume being transferred to post-1996 loan  volume. The interest rate risk and credit loss components are applied to  the stress test through time. The individual sections of that worksheet  are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Elements related to cashflows, earnings rates, and disposition  of discontinued program assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The stress test accounts for earnings rates by asset class and  cost rates on funding. The stress test aggregates investments into the  categories of: Cash and money market securities; commercial paper;  certificates of deposit; agency mortgage-backed securities and  collateralized mortgage obligations; and other investments. With FCA's  concurrence, Farmer Mac is permitted to further disaggregate these  categories. Similarly, we may require new categories for future  activities to be added to the stress test. Loan items requiring separate  accounts include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Farmer Mac I program assets post-1996 Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Farmer Mac I program assets post-1996 Act Swap balances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Farmer Mac I program assets pre-1996 Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Farmer Mac I AgVantage securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Loans held for securitization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Farmer Mac II program assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Rural Utility program volume on balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The stress test also uses data elements related to amortization  and prepayment experience to calculate and process the implied rates at  which asset and liability balances terminate or ``roll off'' through  time. Further, for each category, the stress test has the capacity to  track account balances that are expected to change through time for each  of the above categories. For purposes of the stress test, all assets are  assumed to maintain a ``steady state'' with the implication that any  principal balances retired or prepaid are replaced with new balances.  The exceptions are that expiring pre-1996 Act program assets are  replaced with post-1996 Act program assets and AgVantage Plus volume  maturities are recognized by the model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elements related to other balance sheet assumptions through  time. As well as interest earning assets, the other categories of the  balance sheet that are modeled through time include interest receivable,  guarantee fees receivable, rural utility guarantee fees receivable,  prepaid expenses, accrued interest payable, accounts payable, accrued  expenses, reserves for losses (loans held and guaranteed securities),  and other off-balance sheet obligations. The stress test is consistent  with Farmer Mac's existing reporting categories and practices. If  reporting practices change substantially, the above list will be  adjusted accordingly. The stress test has the capacity to have the  balances in each of these accounts determined based upon existing  relationships to other earning accounts, to keep their balances either  in constant proportions of loan or security accounts, or to evolve  according to a user-selected rule. For purposes of the stress test,  these accounts are to remain constant relative to the proportions of  their associated balance sheet accounts that generated the accrued  balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elements related to income and expense assumptions. Several  other parameters that are required to generate pro forma financial  statements may not be easily captured from historic data or may have  characteristics that suggest that they be individually supplied. These  parameters are the gain on agricultural mortgage-backed securities  (AMBS) sales, miscellaneous income, operating expenses, reserve  requirement, guarantee fees, rural utility guarantee fees, and loan loss  resolution timing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The stress test applies the actual weighted average gain rate on  sales of AMBS over the most recent 3 years to the dollar amount of AMBS  sold during the most recent four quarters in order to estimate gain on  sale of AMBS over the stress period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The stress test assumes miscellaneous income at a level equal to  the average of the most recent 3-year's actual miscellaneous income as a  percent of the sum of; cash, investments, guaranteed securities, and  loans held for investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The stress test assumes that short-term cost of funds is  incurred in relation to the amount of defaulting loans purchased from  off-balance sheet pools. The remaining unpaid principal balance on this  loan volume is the origination amount reduced by the proportion of the  total portfolio that has amortized as of the end of the most recent  quarter. This volume is assumed to be funded at the short-term cost of  funds and this expense continues for a period equal to the loan loss  resolution timing period (LLRT) period minus 1. We will calculate the  LLRT period from Farmer Mac data. In addition, during the LLRT period,  all guarantee income associated with the loan volume ceases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The stress test generates no interest income on the estimated  volume of defaulted on-balance sheet loan volume required to be   carried during the LLRT period, but continues to accrue funding costs  during the remainder of the LLRT period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> You must update the LLRT period in response to changes in the  Corporation's actual experience with each quarterly submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Operating costs are determined in the model using weighted  moving average of operating expenses as a percentage of the sum of on- balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet program activities over the  previous four quarters inclusive of the current submission date. The  share will then be applied forward to the balances of the same  categories throughout the 10-year period of the RBCST model. As  additional data accumulate, the specification will be re-examined and  modified if we deem changing the specification results in a more  appropriate representation of operating expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The reserve requirement as a fraction of loan assets can also be  specified. However, the stress test is run with the reserve requirement  set to zero. Setting the parameter to zero causes the stress test to  calculate a risk-based capital level that is comparable to regulatory  capital, which includes reserves. Thus, the risk-based capital  requirement contains the regulatory capital required, including  reserves. The amount of total capital that is allocated to the reserve  account is determined by GAAP. The stress test applies quarterly updates  of the weighted average guarantee rates for post-1996 Farmer Mac I  assets, pre-1996 Farmer Mac I assets, and Farmer Mac II assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Elements related to earnings rates and funding costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The stress test can accommodate numerous specifications of  earnings and funding costs. In general, both relationships are tied to  the 10-year CMT interest rate. Specifically, each investment account,  each loan item, and each liability account can be specified as fixed  rate, or fixed spread to the 10-year CMT with initial rates determined  by actual data. The stress test calculates specific spreads (weighted  average yield less initial 10-year CMT) by category from the weighted  average yield data supplied by Farmer Mac as described earlier. For  example, the fixed spread for Farmer Mac I program post-1996 Act  mortgages is calculated as follows:  Fixed Spread = Weighted Average Yield less 10-year CMT 0.014 = 0.0694--</p><p class="depth0">0.0554</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The resulting fixed spread of 1.40 percent is then added to the  10-year CMT when it is shocked to determine the new yield. For instance,  if the 10-year CMT is shocked upward by 300 basis points, the yield on  Farmer Mac I program post-1996 Act loans would change as follows:  Yield = Fixed Spread + 10-year CMT .0994 = .014 + .0854</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The adjusted yield is then used for income calculations when  generating pro forma financial statements. All fixed-spread asset and  liability classes are computed in an identical manner using starting  yields provided as data inputs from Farmer Mac. The fixed-yield option  holds the starting yield data constant for the entire 10-year stress  test period. You must run the stress test using the fixed-spread option  for all accounts except for discontinued program activities, such as  Farmer Mac I program loans made before the 1996 Act. For discontinued  loans, the fixed-rate specification must be used if the loans are  primarily fixed-rate mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Elements related to interest rate shock test. As described  earlier, the interest rate shock test is implemented as a single set of  forward interest rates. The stress test applies the up-rate scenario and  down-rate scenario separately. The stress test also uses the results of  Farmer Mac's shock test, as described in paragraph c. of section 4.1,  ``Data Inputs,'' to calculate the impact on equity from a stressful  change in interest rates as discussed in section 3.0 titled, ``Interest  Rate Risk.'' The stress test uses a schedule relating a change in  interest rates to a change in the market value of equity. For instance,  if interest rates are shocked upward so that the percentage change is  262 basis points, the linearly interpolated effective estimated duration  of equity is -6.7405 years given Farmer Mac's interest rate measurement  results at 250 and 300 basis points of -6.7316 and 76.7688 years,  respectively found on the effective duration schedule. The stress test  uses the linearly interpolated estimated effective duration for equity  to calculate the market value change by multiplying duration by the base  value of equity before any rate change from Farmer Mac's interest rate  risk measurement results with the percentage change in interest rates.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Risk Measures</p><p class="depth0">a. This section describes the elements of the stress test in the  worksheet named ``Risk Measures'' that reflect the interest rate shock  and credit loss requirements of the stress test.</p><p class="depth0">b. As described in section 3.1, the stress test applies the  statutory interest rate shock to the initial 10-year CMT rate. It then  generates a series of fixed annual interest rates for the 10-year stress  period that serve as indices for earnings yields and cost of funds rates  used in the stress test. (See the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet for the  resulting interest rate series used in the stress test.)</p><p class="depth0">c. The Credit Loss Module's state-level loss rates, as described in  section 2.4 entitled, ``Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the Stress  Test,'' are entered into the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet and applied to  the loan   balances that exist in each state. The distribution of loan balances by  state is used to allocate new loans that replace loan products that roll  off the balance sheet through time. The loss rates are applied both to  the initial volume and to new loan volume that replaces expiring loans.  The total life of loan losses that are expected at origination are then  allocated through time based on a set of user entries describing the  time-path of losses.</p><p class="depth0">d. The loss rates estimated in the credit risk component of the  stress test are based on an origination year concept, adjusted for loan  seasoning. All losses arising from loans originated in a particular year  are expressed as lifetime age-adjusted losses irrespective of when the  losses actually occur. The fraction of the origination year loss rates  that must be used to allocate losses through time are 43 percent to year  1, 17 percent to year 2, 11.66 percent to year 3, and 4.03 percent for  the remaining years. The total allocated losses in any year are  expressed as a percent of loan volume in that year to reflect the  conversion to exposure year.</p><p class="depth0">e. The credit loss exposure on rural utility volume, described in  section 2.6, ``Calculation of Loss Rates on Rural Utility Volume for Use  in the Stress Test,'' is entered into the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet  applied to the volume balance. All losses arising from rural utility  loans are expressed as annual loss rates and distributed over the  weighted average maturity of the rural utility AgVantage Plus Volume, or  as annual loss across the full 10-year modeling horizon in the case of  rural utility Cash Window loans.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Loan and Cashflow Accounts</p><p class="depth0">The worksheet labeled ``Loan and Cashflow Data'' contains the  categorized loan data and cashflow accounting relationships that are  used in the stress test to generate projections of Farmer Mac's  performance and condition. The steady-state formulation results in  account balances that remain constant except for the effects of  discontinued programs, maturing AgVantage Plus positions, and the LLRT  adjustment. For assets with maturities under 1 year, the results are  reported for convenience as though they matured only one time per year  with the additional convention that the earnings/cost rates are  annualized. For the pre-1996 Act assets, maturing balances are added  back to post-1996 Act account balances. The liability accounts are used  to satisfy the accounting identity, which requires assets to equal  liabilities plus owner equity. In addition to the replacement of  maturities under a steady state, liabilities are increased to reflect  net losses or decreased to reflect resulting net gains. Adjustments must  be made to the long- and short-term debt accounts to maintain the same  relative proportions as existed at the beginning period from which the  stress test is run with the exception of changes associated with the  funding of defaulted loans during the LLRT period. The primary  receivable and payable accounts are also maintained on this worksheet,  as is a summary balance of the volume of loans subject to credit losses.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Income Statements</p><p class="depth0">a. Information related to income performance through time is  contained on the worksheet named ``Income Statements.'' Information from  the first period balance sheet is used in conjunction with the earnings  and cost-spread relationships from Farmer Mac supplied data to generate  the first period's income statement. The same set of accounts is  maintained in this worksheet as ``Loan and Cashflow Accounts'' for  consistency in reporting each annual period of the 10-year stress period  of the test with the exception of the line item labeled ``Interest  reversals to carry loan losses'' which incorporates the LLRT adjustment  to earnings from the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet. Loans that defaulted  do not earn interest or guarantee and commitment fees during LLRT  period. The income from each interest-bearing account is calculated, as  are costs of interest-bearing liabilities. In each case, these entries  are the associated interest rate for that period multiplied by the  account balances.</p><p class="depth0">b. The credit losses described in section 2.0, ``Credit Risk,'' are  transmitted through the provision account, as is any change needed to  re-establish the target reserve balance. For determining risk-based  capital, the reserve target is set to zero as previously indicated in  section 4.2. Under the income tax section, it must first be determined  whether it is appropriate to carry forward tax losses or recapture tax  credits. The tax section then establishes the appropriate income tax  liability that permits the calculation of final net income (loss), which  is credited (debited) to the retained earnings account.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Balance Sheets</p><p class="depth0">a. The worksheet named ``Balance Sheets'' is used to construct pro  forma balance sheets from which the capital calculations can be  performed. As can be seen in the Excel spreadsheet, the worksheet is  organized to correspond to Farmer Mac's normal reporting practices.  Asset accounts are built from the initial financial statement  conditions, and loan and cashflow accounts. Liability accounts including  the reserve account are likewise built from the previous period's  results to balance the asset and equity positions. The equity section  uses initial conditions and standard accounts to monitor equity through  time. The equity section maintains separate categories for increments to  paid-in-capital and retained earnings and for   mark-to-market effects of changes in account values. The process  described below in the ``Capital'' worksheet uses the initial retained  earnings and paid-in-capital account to test for the change in initial  capital that permits conformance to the statutory requirements.  Therefore, these accounts must be maintained separately for test  solution purposes.</p><p class="depth0">b. The market valuation changes due to interest rate movements must  be computed utilizing the linearly interpolated schedule of estimated  equity effects due to changes in interest rates, contained in the  ``Assumptions & Relationships'' worksheet. The stress test calculates  the dollar change in the market value of equity by multiplying the base  value of equity before any rate change from Farmer Mac's interest rate  risk measurement results, the linearly interpolated estimated effective  duration of equity, and the percentage change in interest rates. In  addition, the earnings effect of the measured dollar change in the  market value of equity is estimated by multiplying the dollar change by  the blended cost of funds rate found on the ``Assumptions &  Relationships'' worksheet. Next, divide by 2 the computed earnings  effect to approximate the impact as a theoretical shock in the interest  rates that occurs at the mid-point of the income cycle from period t  0 to period t 1. The measured dollar change in the  market value of equity and related earnings effect are then adjusted to  reflect any tax-related benefits. Tax adjustments are determined by  including the measured dollar change in the market value of equity and  the earnings effect in the tax calculations found in the ``Income  Statements'' worksheet. This approach ensures that the value of equity  reflects the economic loss or gain in value of Farmer Mac's capital  position from a change in interest rates and reflects any immediate tax  benefits that Farmer Mac could realize. Any tax benefits in the module  are posted through the income statement by adjusting the net taxes due  before calculating final net income. Final net income is posted to  accumulated unretained earnings in the shareholders' equity portion of  the balance sheet. The tax section is also described in section 4.5  entitled, ``Income Statements.''</p><p class="depth0">c. After one cycle of income has been calculated, the balance sheet  as of the end of the income period is then generated. The ``Balance  Sheet'' worksheet shows the periodic pro forma balance sheets in a  format convenient to track capital shifts through time.</p><p class="depth0">d. The stress test considers Farmer Mac's balance sheet as subject  to interest rate risk and, therefore, the capital position reflects  mark-to-market changes in the value of equity. This approach ensures  that the stress test captures interest rate risk in a meaningful way by  addressing explicitly the loss or gain in value resulting from the  change in interest rates required by the statute.</p><p class="depth0">4.7 Capital</p><p class="depth0">The ``Capital'' worksheet contains the results of the required  capital calculations as described below, and provides a method to  calculate the level of initial capital that would permit Farmer Mac to  maintain positive capital throughout the 10-year stress test period.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Capital Calculation</p><p class="depth0">a. The stress test computes regulatory capital as the sum of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The par value of outstanding common stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The par value of outstanding preferred stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Paid-in capital;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retained earnings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reserve for loan and guarantee losses.</p><p class="depth0">b. Inclusion of the reserve account in regulatory capital is an  important difference compared to minimum capital as defined by the  statute. Therefore, the calculation of reserves in the stress test is  also important because reserves are reduced by loan and guarantee  losses. The reserve account is linked to the income statement through  the provision for loan-loss expense (provision). Provision expense  reflects the amount of current income necessary to rebuild the reserve  account to acceptable levels after loan losses reduce the account or as  a result of increases in the level of risky mortgage positions, both on-  and off-balance sheet. Provision reversals represent reductions in the  reserve levels due to reduced risk of loan losses or loan volume of  risky mortgage positions. The liabilities section of the ``Balance  Sheets'' worksheet also includes separate line items to disaggregate the  Guarantee and commitment obligation related to the Financial Accounting  Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 460, Guarantees.  This item is disaggregated to permit accurate calculation of regulatory  capital post-adoption of FIN 45. When calculating the stress test, the  reserve is maintained at zero to result in a risk-based capital  requirement that includes reserves, thereby making the requirement  comparable to the statutory definition of regulatory capital. By setting  the reserve requirement to zero, the capital position includes all  financial resources Farmer Mac has at its disposal to withstand risk.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Method of Calculation</p><p class="depth0">a. Risk-based capital is calculated in the stress test as the  minimum initial capital that would permit Farmer Mac to remain solvent  for the ensuing 10 years. To this amount, an additional 30 percent is  added to account for managerial and operational risks   not reflected in the specific components of the stress test.</p><p class="depth0">b. The relationship between the solvency constraint (i.e., future  capital position not less than zero) and the risk-based capital  requirement reflects the appropriate earnings and funding cost rates  that may vary through time based on initial conditions. Therefore, the  minimum capital at a future point in time cannot be directly used to  determine the risk-based capital requirement. To calculate the risk- based capital requirement, the stress test includes a section to solve  for the minimum initial capital value that results in a minimum capital  level over the 10 years of zero at the point in time that it would  actually occur. In solving for initial capital, it is assumed that  reductions or additions to the initial capital accounts are made in the  retained earnings accounts, and balanced in the debt accounts at terms  proportionate to initial balances (same relative proportion of long- and  short-term debt at existing initial rates). Because the initial capital  position affects the earnings, and hence capital positions and  appropriate discount rates through time, the initial and future capital  are simultaneously determined and must be solved iteratively. The  resulting minimum initial capital from the stress test is then reported  on the ``Capital'' worksheet of the stress test. The ``Capital''  worksheet includes an element that uses Excel's ``solver'' or ``goal  seek'' capability to calculate the minimum initial capital that, when  added (subtracted) from initial capital and replaced with debt, results  in a minimum capital balance over the following 10 years of zero.
