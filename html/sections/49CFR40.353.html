                                Sec. 40.353  What principles govern the interaction between MROs
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As a service agent other than an MRO (e.g., a C/TPA), the following principles govern your interaction with MROs:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may provide MRO services to employers, directly or through contract, if you meet all applicable provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you employ or contract for an MRO, the MRO must perform duties independently and confidentially. When you have a relationship with an MRO, you must structure the relationship to ensure that this independence and confidentiality are not compromised. Specific means (including both physical and operational measures, as appropriate) to separate MRO functions and other service agent functions are essential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only your staff who are actually under the day-to-day supervision and control of an MRO with respect to MRO functions may perform these functions. This does not mean that those staff may not perform other functions at other times. However, the designation of your staff to perform MRO functions under MRO supervision must be limited and not used as a subterfuge to circumvent confidentiality and other requirements of this part and DOT agency regulations. You must ensure that MRO staff operate under controls sufficient to ensure that the independence and confidentiality of the MRO process are not compromised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Like other MROs, an MRO you employ or contract with must personally conduct verification interviews with employees and must personally make all verification decisions. Consequently, your staff cannot perform these functions.</p>
