                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The mechanical stress relief shall be carried out in accordance  with the following stipulations using water as the pressurizing medium:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At a hydrostatic pressure (measured at the tank top) of 1\1/2\  times the design pressure. (See UA-60(e) of section VIII of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At a temperature of 70 [deg]F. or the service temperature plus  50 [deg]F., whichever is higher. Where the ambient temperature is below  70 [deg]F., and use of water at that temperature is not practical, the  minimum temperature for mechanical stress relief may be below 70 [deg]F.  but shall not be less than 50 [deg]F. above service temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The stress relief shall be at the required temperature and  pressure and held for a period not less than 2 hours per inch of metal  thickness, but in no case less than 2 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is considered preferable that mechanical stress relief be  accomplished with the tanks in place on their saddles or supporting  structure in the barge or ship in which they will be utilized. In any  case, it is considered mandatory that the tank be supported only by its  regular saddles or supporting structure, without any auxiliary or  temporary supports.
