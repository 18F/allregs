                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Near-surface disposal facility operation and disposal site closure. (1) Wastes designated as Class A pursuant to Sec. 61.55, must be segregated from other wastes by placing in disposal units which are sufficiently separated from disposal units for the other waste classes so that any interaction between Class A wastes and other wastes will not result in the failure to meet the performance objectives in subpart C of this Part. This segregation is not necessary for Class A wastes if they meet the stability requirements in Sec. 61.56(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wastes designated as Class A pursuant to Sec. 61.55, must be segregated from other wastes by placing in disposal units which are sufficiently separated from disposal units for the other waste classes so that any interaction between Class A wastes and other wastes will not result in the failure to meet the performance objectives in subpart C of this Part. This segregation is not necessary for Class A wastes if they meet the stability requirements in Sec. 61.56(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wastes designated as Class C pursuant to Sec. 61.55, must be disposed of so that the top of the waste is a minimum of 5 meters below the top surface of the cover or must be disposed of with intruder barriers that are designed to protect against an inadvertent intrusion for a least 500 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (4) through (11) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wastes must be emplaced in a manner that maintains the package integrity during emplacement, minimizes the void spaces between packages, and permits the void spaces to be filled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Void spaces between waste packages must be filled with earth or other material to reduce future subsidence within the fill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Waste must be placed and covered in a manner that limits the radiation dose rate at the surface of the cover to levels that at a minimum will permit the licensee to comply with all provisions of Sec. Sec. 20.1301 and 20.1302 of this chapter at the time the license is transferred pursuant to Sec. 61.30 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The boundaries and locations of each disposal unit (e.g., trenches) must be accurately located and mapped by means of a land survey. Near-surface disposal units must be marked in such a way that the boundaries of each unit can be easily defined. Three permanent survey marker control points, referenced to United States Geological Survey (USGS) or National Geodetic Survey (NGS) survey control stations, must be established on the site to facilitate surveys. The USGS or NGS control stations must provide horizontal and vertical controls as checked against USGS or NGS record files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A buffer zone of land must be maintained between any buried waste and the disposal site boundary and beneath the disposed waste. The buffer zone shall be of adequate dimensions to carry out environmental monitoring activities specified in Sec. 61.53(d) of this part and take mitigative measures if needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Closure and stabilization measures as set forth in the approved site closure plan must be carried out as each disposal unit (e.g., each trench) is filled and covered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Active waste disposal operations must not have an adverse effect on completed closure and stabilization measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Only wastes containing or contaminated with radioactive materials shall be disposed of at the disposal site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facility operation and disposal site closure for land disposal facilities other than near-surface.
