                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For program approval, the Governor of the state must designate a  single state agency to receive and administer the grants for  implementing the management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This entity must have the fiscal and legal capability to accept  and administer grant funds, to make contracts or other arrangements  (such as passthrough grants) with participating agencies for the purpose  of carrying out specific management tasks and to account for the  expenditure of the implementation funds of any recipient of such monies,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This entity must have the administrative capability to monitor  and evaluate the management of the State's coastal resources by the  various agencies and/or local governments with specified  responsibilities under the management program (irrespective of whether  such entities receive section 306 funds); to make periodic reports to  the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), the  Governor, or the State legislature, as appropriate, regarding the  performance of all agencies involved in the program. The entity also  must be capable of presenting evidence of adherence to the management  program or justification for deviation as part of the review by OCRM of  State performance required by section 312 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 306 agency designation is designed to establish a single  point of accountability for prudent use of administrative funds in the  furtherance of the management and for monitoring of management  activities. Designation does not imply that this single agency need be a  ``super agency'' or the principal implementation vehicle. It is,  however, the focal point for proper administration and evaluation of the  State's program and the entity to which OCRM will look when monitoring  and reevaluating a State's program during program implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement for the single designated agency should not be  viewed as confining or otherwise limiting the role and responsibilities  which may be assigned to this agency. It is up to the State to decide in  what manner and to what extent the designated State agency will be  involved in actual program implementation or enforcement. In determining  the extent to which this agency should be involved in program  implementation or enforcement, specific factors should be considered,  such as the manner in which local and regional authorities are involved  in program implementation, the administrative structure of the State,  the authorities to be relied upon and the agencies administering such  authorities. Because the designated State agency may be viewed as the  best vehicle for increasing the unity and efficiency of a management  program, the State may want to consider the following in selecting which  agency to designate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the designated State entity has a legislative mandate to  coordinate other State or local programs, plans and/or policies within  the coastal zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To what extent linkages already exist between the entity, other  agencies, and local governments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To what extent management or regulatory authorities affecting  the coastal zone presently are administered by the agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the agency is equipped to handle monitoring, evaluation  and enforcement responsibilities.</p>
