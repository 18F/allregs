A Special Authorization  authorizing the carriage of blind sector traffic will be issued only if  the Board finds that the proposed carriage is fully consistent with  applicable law and this part, and that grant of such authority would be  in the public interest. The application may be granted or denied in  whole or in part without hearing, and a Special Authorization made  subject to any conditions or limitations, to the extent that such action  is deemed by the Board to be in the public interest. Special  Authorizations are not transferable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nature of the privilege conferred. A Special Authorization  issued pursuant to this section shall constitute a privilege conferred  upon a carrier, which may be enjoyed only to the extent that its  continued exercise remains in the interest of the public.
