They apply to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to an applicant or recipient for its program or activity after the effective date of these regulations pursuant to an application approved or statutory or other provision made therefor prior to such effective date. The regulations in this part do not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part, (3) any assistance to an applicant or recipient who is an ultimate beneficiary, or (4) except as provided in Sec. 15.3(c), any employment practice of any employer, employment agency or labor organization. The fact that a specific kind of Federal financial assistance is not listed in the appendix, shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such Federal financial assistance is not covered. Other Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice approved and issued by the Secretary and published in the Federal Register.
