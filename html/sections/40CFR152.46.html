Based upon the notification, the Agency may require that the registrant submit an application for amended registration. If it does so, the Agency will notify the registrant and state its reasons for requiring an application for amended registration. Thereafter, if the registrant fails to submit an application the Agency may determine that the product is not in compliance with the requirements of the Act.
