Identify by one of the following means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aircraft radio station call sign.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of aircraft followed by the characters of the  registration marking (``N'' number) of the aircraft, omitting the prefix  letter ``N.'' When communication is initiated by a ground station, an  aircraft station may use the type of aircraft followed by the last three  characters of the registration marking. Notwithstanding any   other provision of this section, an aircraft being moved by maintenance  personnel from one location in an airport to another location in that  airport may be identified by a station identification consisting of the  name of the company owning or operating the aircraft, followed by the  word ``Maintenance'' and additional alphanumeric characters of the  licensee's choosing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FAA assigned radiotelephony designator of the aircraft  operating organization followed by the flight identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An aircraft identification approved by the FAA for use by  aircraft stations participating in an organized flying activity of short  duration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Land and fixed stations. Identify by means of radio station call  sign, its location, its assigned FAA identifier, the name of the city  area or airport which it serves, or any additional identification  required. An aeronautical enroute station which is part of a  multistation network may also be identified by the location of its  control point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Survival craft station. Identify by transmitting a reference to  its parent aircraft. No identification is required when distress signals  are transmitted automatically. Transmissions other than distress or  emergency signals, such as equipment testing or adjustment, must be  identified by the call sign or by the registration marking of the parent  aircraft followed by a single digit other than 0 or 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exempted station. The following types of stations are exempted  from the use of a call sign: Airborne weather radar, radio altimeter,  air traffic control transponder, distance measuring equipment, collision  avoidance equipment, racon, radio relay, radionavigation land test  station (MTF), and automatically controlled aeronautical enroute  stations.
