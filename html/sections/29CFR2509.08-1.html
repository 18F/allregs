                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This Interpretive Bulletin sets forth the Department of Labor's  interpretation of sections 403 and 404 of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as applied to employee benefit plan  investments in ``economically targeted investments,'' that is,  investments selected for the economic benefits they create apart from  their investment return to the employee benefit plan. The guidance set  forth in this interpretive bulletin modifies and supersedes the guidance  set forth in interpretive bulletin 94-1 (29 CFR 2509.94-1).</p><p class="depth0">ERISA requires that a fiduciary act solely in the interest of the  plan's participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of  providing benefits to their participants and beneficiaries. The Act  specifically states, in relevant part, that:</p><p class="depth0"> ``[A]ssets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any  employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing  benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries.* * *'' \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Sec. 403(c)(1), 29 U.S.C.A. 1103(c)(1). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"> ``[A] fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan  solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and for the  exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their  beneficiaries.'' \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Sec. 404(a)(1)(A)(i), 29 U.S.C.A. 1104(a)(1)(A)(i). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ERISA's plain text thus establishes a clear rule that in the course  of discharging their duties, fiduciaries may never subordinate the  economic interests of the plan to unrelated objectives, and may not  select investments on the basis of any factor outside the economic  interest of the plan except in very limited circumstances enumerated  below.</p><p class="depth0">With regard to investing plan assets, the Department has issued a  regulation, at 29 CFR 2550.404a-1, interpreting the prudence  requirements of ERISA as they apply to the investment duties of  fiduciaries of employee benefit plans. The regulation provides that the  prudence requirements of section 404(a)(1)(B) are satisfied if (1) the  fiduciary making an investment or engaging in an investment course of  action has given appropriate consideration to those facts and  circumstances that, given the scope of the fiduciary's investment  duties, the fiduciary knows or should know are relevant, and (2) the  fiduciary acts accordingly. This includes giving appropriate  consideration to the role that the investment or investment course of   action plays (in terms of such factors as diversification, liquidity and  risk/return characteristics) with respect to that portion of the plan's  investment portfolio within the scope of the fiduciary's responsibility.</p><p class="depth0">Other facts and circumstances relevant to an investment or  investment course of action would, in the view of the Department,  include consideration of the expected return on alternative investments  with similar risks available to the plan. It follows that, because every  investment necessarily causes a plan to forgo other investment  opportunities, an investment will not be prudent if it would be expected  to provide a plan with a lower rate of return than available alternative  investments with commensurate degrees of risk or is riskier than  alternative available investments with commensurate rates of return.</p><p class="depth0">ERISA's plain text does not permit fiduciaries to make investment  decisions on the basis of any factor other than the economic interest of  the plan. Situations may arise, however, in which two or more investment  alternatives are of equal economic value to a plan. The Department has  recognized in past guidance that under these limited circumstances,  fiduciaries can choose between the investment alternatives on the basis  of a factor other than the economic interest of the plan. The Department  has interpreted the statute to permit this selection because (1) ERISA  requires fiduciaries to invest plan assets and to make choices between  investment alternatives, (2) ERISA does not itself specifically provide  a basis for making the investment choice in this circumstance, and (3)  the economic interests of the plan are fully protected by the fact that  the available investment alternatives are, from the plan's perspective,  economically indistinguishable.</p><p class="depth0">Given the significance of ERISA's requirement that fiduciaries act  ``solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries,'' the  Department believes that, before selecting an economically targeted  investment, fiduciaries must have first concluded that the alternative  options are truly equal, taking into account a quantitative and  qualitative analysis of the economic impact on the plan. ERISA's  fiduciary standards expressed in sections 403 and 404 do not permit  fiduciaries to select investments based on factors outside the economic  interests of the plan until they have concluded, based on economic  factors, that alternative investments are equal. A less rigid rule would  allow fiduciaries to act on the basis of factors outside the economic  interest of the plan in situations where reliance on those factors might  compromise or subordinate the interests of plan participants and their  beneficiaries. The Department rejects a construction of ERISA that would  render the Act's tight limits on the use of plan assets illusory, and  that would permit plan fiduciaries to expend ERISA trust assets to  promote myriad public policy preferences. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ See letters from the Department of Labor to Jonathan Hiatt dated  May 3, 2005; to Thomas Donahue dated December 21, 2007 (A.O. 2007-07A);  and to David Chavern dated June 27, 2008 (A.O. 2008-05A). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A plan fiduciary's analysis is required to comply with, but is not  necessarily limited to, the requirements set forth in 29 CFR 2550.404a- 1(b). In evaluating the plan portfolio, as well as portions of the  portfolio, the fiduciary is required to examine the level of  diversification, degree of liquidity, and the potential risk/return in  comparison with available alternative investments. The same type of  analysis must also be applied when choosing between investment  alternatives. Potential investments should be compared to other  investments that would fill a similar role in the portfolio with regard  to diversification, liquidity, and risk/return.</p><p class="depth0">In light of the rigorous requirements established by ERISA, the  Department believes that fiduciaries who rely on factors outside the  economic interests of the plan in making investment choices and  subsequently find their decision challenged will rarely be able to  demonstrate compliance with ERISA absent a written record demonstrating  that a contemporaneous economic analysis showed that the investment  alternatives were of equal value.</p><p class="depth0">Examples:</p><p class="depth0">A plan owns an interest in a limited partnership that is considering  investing in a company that competes with the plan sponsor. The  fiduciaries may not replace the limited partnership investment with  another investment based on this fact unless they prudently determine  that a replacement investment is economically equal or superior to the  limited partnership investment and would not adversely affect the plan's  investment portfolio, taking into account factors including  diversification, liquidity, risk and expected return. The competition of  the limited partnership with the plan sponsor is a factor outside the  economic interests of the plan, and thus cannot be considered unless an  alternative investment is equal or superior to the limited partnership.</p><p class="depth0">A multiemployer plan covering employees in a metropolitan area's  construction industry wants to invest in a large loan for a construction  project located in the same area because it will create local jobs. The  plan has taken steps to ensure that the loan poses no prohibited  transaction issues. The loan carries a return fully commensurate with  the risk of nonpayment. Moreover, the loan's expected return is equal to  or greater than construction loans of similar quality that are available  to the plan. However, the plan   has already made several other loans for construction projects in the  same metropolitan area, and this loan could create a risk of large  losses to the plan's portfolio due to lack of diversification. The  fiduciaries may not choose this investment on the basis of the local job  creation factor because, due to lack of diversification, the investment  is not of equal economic value to the plan.</p><p class="depth0">A plan is considering an investment in a bond to finance affordable  housing for people in the local community. The bond provides a return at  least as favorable to the plan as other bonds with the same risk rating.  However, the bond's size and lengthy duration raises a potential risk  regarding the plan's ability to meet its predicted liquidity needs.  Other available bonds under consideration by the plan do not pose this  same risk. The return on the bond, although equal to or greater than the  alternatives, would not be sufficient to offset the additional risk for  the plan created by the role that this bond would play in the plan's  portfolio. The plan's fiduciaries may not make this investment based on  factors outside the economic interest of the plan because it is not of  equal or greater economic value to other investment alternatives.</p><p class="depth0">A plan sponsor adopts an investment policy that favors plan  investment in companies meeting certain environmental criteria (so- called ``green'' companies). In carrying out the policy, the plan's  fiduciaries may not simply consider investments only in green companies.  They must consider all investments that meet the plan's prudent  financial criteria. The fiduciaries may apply the investment policy to  eliminate a company from consideration only if they appropriately  determine that other available investments provide equal or better  returns at the same or lower risks, and would play the same role in the  plan's portfolio.</p><p class="depth0">A collective investment fund, which holds assets of several plans,  is designed to invest in commercial real estate constructed or renovated  with union labor. Fiduciaries of plans that invest in the fund must  determine that the fund's overall risk and return characteristics are as  favorable, or more favorable, to the plans as other available investment  alternatives that would play a similar role in their plans' portfolios.  The fund's managers may select investments constructed or improved with  union labor, after an economic analysis indicates that these investment  options are equal or superior to their alternatives. The managers will  best be able to justify their investment choice by recording their  analysis in writing. However, if real estate investments that satisfy  both ERISA's fiduciary requirements and the union labor criterion are  unavailable, the fund managers may have to select investments without  regard to the union labor criterion.
