                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For all emission measurements, use test fuels that meet  the specifications in this subpart, unless the standard-setting part  directs otherwise. Section 1065.10(c)(1) does not apply with respect to  test fuels. Note   that the standard-setting parts generally require that you design your  emission controls to function properly when using commercially available  fuels, even if they differ from the test fuel. Where we specify multiple  grades of a certain fuel type (such as diesel fuel with different sulfur  concentrations), see the standard-setting part to determine which grade  to use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fuels meeting alternate specifications. We may allow you to use  a different test fuel (such as California Phase 2 gasoline) if it does  not affect your ability to show that your engines would comply with all  applicable emission standards using the fuel specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuels not specified in this subpart. If you produce engines that  run on a type of fuel (or mixture of fuels) that we do not specify in  this subpart, you must get our written approval to establish the  appropriate test fuel. See the standard-setting part for provisions  related to fuels and fuel mixtures not specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For engines designed to operate on a single fuel, we will  generally allow you to use the fuel if you show us all the following  things are true:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Show that your engines will use only the designated fuel in  service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Show that this type of fuel is commercially available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Show that operating the engines on the fuel we specify would  be inappropriate, as in the following examples:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The engine will not run on the specified fuel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The engine or emission controls will not be durable or work  properly when operating with the specified fuel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The measured emission results would otherwise be substantially  unrepresentative of in-use emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines that are designed to operate on different fuel  types, the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section  apply with respect to each fuel type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For engines that are designed to operate on different fuel types  as well as continuous mixtures of those fuels, we may require you to  test with either the worst-case fuel mixture or the most representative  fuel mixture, unless the standard-setting part specifies otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel specifications. Specifications in this section apply as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measure and calculate values as described in the appropriate  reference procedure. Record and report final values expressed to at  least the same number of decimal places as the applicable limit value.  The right-most digit for each limit value is significant unless  specified otherwise. For example, for a specified distillation  temperature of 60 [deg]C, determine the test fuel's value to at least  the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fuel parameters specified in this subpart depend on  measurement procedures that are incorporated by reference. For any of  these procedures, you may instead rely upon the procedures identified in  40 CFR part 80 for measuring the same parameter. For example, we may  identify different reference procedures for measuring gasoline  parameters in 40 CFR 80.46.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Two-stroke fuel/oil mixing. For two-stroke engines, use a fuel/ oil mixture meeting the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service accumulation and field testing fuels. If we do not  specify a service-accumulation or field-testing fuel in the standard- setting part, use an appropriate commercially available fuel such as  those meeting minimum specifications from the following table:</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 of Sec.   1065.701--Examples of Service-Accumulation and Field-</p><p class="depth2">Testing Fuels ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Reference</p><p class="depth2">Fuel category               Subcategory        procedure \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Diesel..........................
