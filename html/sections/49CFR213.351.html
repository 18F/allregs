to accommodate expansion and contraction due to temperature variations. When no-slip, joint-to-rail contact exists by design, the requirements of this section do not apply. Those locations, when over 400 feet long, are considered to be continuous welded rail track and shall meet all the requirements for continuous welded rail track prescribed in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No rail shall have a bolt hole which is torch cut or burned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No joint bar shall be reconfigured by torch cutting.</p>
