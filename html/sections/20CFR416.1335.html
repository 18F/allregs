                            <p class="depth0">We will terminate your eligibility for benefits following 12 consecutive months of benefit suspension for any reason beginning with the first month you were no longer eligible for regular SSI cash benefits, federally-administered State supplementation, special SSI cash benefits described in Sec. 416.262, or special SSI eligibility status described in Sec. 416.265. We will count the 12-month suspension period from the start of the first month that you are no longer eligible for SSI benefits (see Sec. 416.1320(a)) or the start of the month after the month your special SSI eligibility status described in Sec. 416.265 ended. This termination is effective with the start of the 13th month after the suspension began.
