                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ownership of assets. For all income tax purposes, an Institution is treated as the owner of all assets covered by a Loss Guarantee, yield maintenance agreement, or cost to carry or cost of funds reimbursement agreement, regardless of whether Agency (or a Controlled Entity) otherwise would be treated as the owner under general principles of income taxation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debt and equity interests received by Agency. Debt instruments, stock, warrants, or other rights to acquire stock of an Institution (or any of its affiliates) that Agency or a Controlled Entity receives in connection with a transaction in which FFA is provided are not treated as debt, stock or other equity interests of or in the issuer for any purpose of the Internal Revenue Code while held by Agency or a Controlled Entity. On the date Agency or a Controlled Entity transfers an interest described in this paragraph (b) to a holder other than Agency or a Controlled Entity, the interest is treated

as having been newly issued by the issuer to the holder with an issue price equal to the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of property paid by the new holder in exchange for the interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency Obligations--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the original issue discount rules of sections 1271 et seq. apply to Agency Obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the original issue discount rules of sections 1271 et seq. apply to Agency Obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issue price of Agency Obligations provided as Net Worth Assistance. The issue price of an Agency Obligation that is provided as Net Worth Assistance and that bears interest at either a single fixed rate or a qualified floating rate (and provides for no contingent payments) is the lesser of the sum of the present values of all payments due under the obligation, discounted at a rate equal to the applicable Federal rate (within the meaning of section 1274(d) (1) and (3)) in effect for the date of issuance, or the stated principal amount of the obligation. The issue price of an Agency Obligation that bears a qualified floating rate of interest (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-5(b)) is determined by treating the obligation as bearing a fixed rate of interest equal to the rate in effect on the date of issuance under the obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments to principal amount. Except as provided in Sec. 1.597-5(d)(2)(iv), this paragraph (c)(3) applies if Agency modifies or exchanges an Agency Obligation provided as Net Worth Assistance (or a successor obligation). The issue price of the modified or new Agency Obligation is determined under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. If the issue price is greater than the adjusted issue price of the existing Agency Obligation, the difference is treated as FFA. If the issue price is less than the adjusted issue price of the existing Agency Obligation, the difference is treated as an adjustment to FFA under Sec. 1.597-2(d)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Successors. To the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of the regulations under section 597, an entity's treatment under the regulations applies to its successor. A successor includes a transferee in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies or a Bridge Bank to which another Bridge Bank transfers deposit liabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Losses and deductions with respect to covered assets. Prior to the disposition of an asset covered by a Loss Guarantee, the asset cannot be charged off, marked to a market value, depreciated, amortized, or otherwise treated in a manner that supposes an actual or possible diminution of value below the greater of the asset's highest guaranteed value or the highest price at which the asset can be put.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Anti-abuse rule. The regulations under section 597 must be applied in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 597. Accordingly, if, in structuring or engaging in any transaction, a principal purpose is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 597 and the regulations thereunder, the Commissioner can make appropriate adjustments to income, deductions and other items that would be consistent with those purposes.
