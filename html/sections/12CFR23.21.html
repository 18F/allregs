                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recovery of investment and costs. A national bank's estimate of the residual value of the property that the bank relies upon to satisfy the requirements of a full-payout lease, for purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be reasonable in light of the nature of the leased property and all circumstances relevant to the transaction; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any unguaranteed amount must not exceed 25 percent of the original cost of the property to the bank or the percentage for a particular type of property specified in published OCC guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estimated residual value subject to guarantee. The amount of any estimated residual value guaranteed by the manufacturer, the lessee, or other third party may exceed 25 percent of the original cost of the property if the bank determines, and demonstrates by appropriate documentation, that the guarantor has the resources to meet the guarantee and the guarantor is not an affiliate of the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Leases to government entities. A bank's calculations of estimated residual value in connection with leases of personal property to Federal, State, or local governmental entities may be based on future transactions or renewals that the bank reasonably anticipates will occur.
