                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. Each Center will be reviewed at least annually, and at  the end of its third year of operation according to the procedures and  criteria set out below. There will be regular management interaction  with NIST and the other Centers for the purpose of evaluation and  program shaping. Centers are encouraged to try new approaches, must  evaluate their effectiveness, and abandon or adjust those which do not  have the desired impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual reviews of centers. Centers will be reviewed annually as  part of the funding renewal process using the criteria set out in Sec.  290.8(d). The funding level at which a Center is renewed is contingent  upon a positive program evaluation and will depend upon the availability  of federal funds and on the Center's ability to obtain suitable match,  as well as on the budgetary requirements of its proposed program.  Centers must continue to demonstrate that they will be self-supporting  after six years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Third year review of centers. Each host receiving a Center  Operating Award under these procedures shall be evaluated during its  third year of operation by a Merit Review Panel appointed by the  Secretary of Commerce. Each such Merit Review Panel shall be composed of  private experts, none of whom shall be connected with the involved  Center, and Federal officials. An official of NIST shall chair the  panel. Each Merit Review Panel shall measure the involved Center's  performance against the criteria set out in Sec. 290.8(d). The  Secretary shall not provide funding for the fourth through the sixth  years of such Center's operation unless the evaluation is positive on  all grounds. As a condition of receiving continuing funding, the Center  must show evidence at the third year review that they are making  substantial progress toward self-sufficiency. If the evaluation is  positive and funds are available, the Secretary of Commerce   may provide continued funding through the sixth year at declining  levels, which are designed to insure that the Center no longer needs  financial support from NIST by the seventh year. In no event shall  funding for a Center be provided by the NIST Manufacturing Technology  Centers Program after the sixth year of support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for annual and third year reviews. Centers will be  evaluated under the following criteria in each of the annual reviews, as  well as the third year review:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The program objectives specified in Sec. 290.3(b) of these  procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds-matching performance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the target firms have successfully  implemented recently developed or currently developed advanced  manufacturing technology and techniques transferred by the Center;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which successes are properly documented and there  has been further leveraging or use of a particular advanced  manufacturing technology or process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The degree to which there is successful operation of a network,  or technology delivery mechanism, involving the sharing or dissemination  of information related to manufacturing technologies among industry,  universities, nonprofit economic development organizations and state  governments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which the Center can increasingly develop  continuing resources--both technological and financial--such that the  Centers are finally financially self-sufficient.</p>
