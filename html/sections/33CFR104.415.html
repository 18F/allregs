The Coast Guard will give the  vessel owner or operator written notice and request that the vessel  owner or operator propose amendments addressing any matters specified in  the notice. The company owner or operator will have at least 60 days to  submit its proposed amendments. Until amendments are approved, the  company owner or operator shall ensure temporary security measures are  implemented to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed amendments must be sent to the MSC at the address shown  in Sec.  104.400(b) of this part. If initiated by the company or vessel,  owner or operator, the proposed amendment must be submitted at least 30  days before the amendment is to take effect unless the MSC allows a  shorter period. The MSC will approve or disapprove the proposed  amendment in accordance with Sec.  104.410 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section should be construed as limiting the  vessel owner or operator from the timely implementation of such  additional security measures not enumerated in the approved VSP as  necessary to address exigent security situations. In such cases, the  owner or operator must notify the MSC by the most rapid means  practicable as to the nature of the additional measures, the  circumstances that prompted these additional measures, and the period of  time these additional measures are expected to be in place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the owner or operator has changed, the Vessel Security  Officer (VSO) must amend the Vessel Security Plan (VSP) to include the  name and   contact information of the new vessel owner or operator and submit the  affected portion of the VSP for review and approval in accordance with  Sec.  104.410 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Audits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CSO or VSO must ensure an audit of the VSP is  performed annually, beginning no later than one year from the initial  date of approval and attach a letter to the VSP certifying that the VSP  meets the applicable requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The VSP must be audited if there is a change in the company's or  vessel's ownership or operator, or if there have been modifications to  the vessel, including but not limited to physical structure, emergency  response procedures, security measures, or operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Auditing the VSP as a result of modifications to the vessel may  be limited to those sections of the VSP affected by the vessel  modifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless impracticable due to the size and nature of the company  or the vessel, personnel conducting internal audits of the security  measures specified in the VSP or evaluating its implementation must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have knowledge of methods of conducting audits and inspections,  and control and monitoring techniques;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not have regularly assigned security duties; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be independent of any security measures being audited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the results of an audit require amendment of either the VSA  or VSP, the VSO or CSO must submit, in accordance with Sec.  104.410 of  this part, the amendments to the MSC for review and approval no later  than 30 days after completion of the audit and a letter certifying that  the amended VSP meets the applicable requirements of this part.
