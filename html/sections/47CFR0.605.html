                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of all open and closed meetings will be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The meeting notice will be submitted for publication in the  Federal Register on or before the date on which the announcement is  made. Copies will be available in the Press and News Media Division on  the day the announcement is made. Copies will also be attached to ``FCC  Actions Alert'', which is mailed to certain individuals and groups who  have demonstrated an interest in representing the public in Commission  proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the agency staff determines that a meeting should be open  to the public, it will, at least one week prior to the meeting, announce  in writing the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, that it is  to be open to the public, and the name and phone number of the Chief,  Press and News Media Division, who has been designated to respond to  requests for information about the meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the staff determines that a meeting should be closed to the  public, it will refer the matter to the General Counsel, who will  certify that there is (or is not) a legal basis for closing the meeting  to the public. Following action by the General Counsel, the matter may  be referred to the agency for a vote on the question of closing the  meeting (See Sec. 0.606).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the question of closing a meeting is considered by the  agency but no vote is taken, the agency will, at least one week prior to  the meeting, announce in writing the time, place and subject matter of  the meeting, that it is to be open to the public, and the name and phone  number of the Chief, Press and News Media Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a vote is taken, the agency will, in the same announcement  and within one day after the vote, make public the vote of each  participating Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the vote is to close the meeting, the agency will also, in  that announcement, set out a full written explanation of its action,  including the applicable provision(s) of Sec. 0.603, and a list of  persons expected to attend the meeting, including Commission personnel,  together with their affiliations. The Commissioners, their assistants,  the General Counsel, the Executive Director, the Chief, Press and News  Media Division, and the Secretary are expected to attend all Commission  meetings. The appropriate Bureau or Office Chief and Division Chief are  expected to attend meetings which relate to their responsibilities (see  subpart A of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a meeting is closed, the agency may omit from the  announcement information usually included, if and to the extent that it  finds that disclosure would be likely to have any of the consequences  listed in Sec. 0.603.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the prompt and orderly conduct of agency business requires  that a meeting be held less than one week after the announcement of the  meeting, or before that announcement, the agency will issue the  announcement at the earliest practicable time. In addition to other  information, the announcement will contain the vote of each member of  the agency who participated in the decision to give less than seven days  notice, and the particular reason for that decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If, after announcement of a meeting, the time or place of the  meeting is changed or the meeting is cancelled, the agency will announce  the change at the earliest practicable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the subject matter or the determination to open or close a  meeting is changed, the agency will publicly announce the change and the  vote of each member at the earliest practicable time. The announcement  will contain a finding that agency business requires the change and that  no earlier announcement of the change was possible.
