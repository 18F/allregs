                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Employees serving after February 7, 1968, in  competitive positions under indefinite appointments or temporary  appointments pending establishment of a register or as status quo  employees acquire competitive status and are entitled to have their  employment converted to career employment when such employees:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complete a total of at least 3 years of service in such a  position under one or more such appointments without a break in service  of more than 30 calendar days or without an interruption by  nonqualifying service of more than 30 calendar days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have rendered satisfactory service for the 12 months immediately  preceding the conversion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meet applicable qualification requirements for the positions and  are otherwise eligible for career employment. This paragraph does not  apply to employees serving under an overseas limited appointment or in  positions above GS-15 or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Creditable service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In computing creditable service under  paragraph (a) of this section for an employee who left a competitive  position in which he or she was serving under a qualifying appointment  covered in paragraph (a) of this section to enter the armed forces and  who is reemployed in such a position within 120 calendar days after  separation under honorable conditions, the period from the date he or  she left the position to the date of reemployment is creditable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Office shall publish in its operating manuals the conditions  under which full-time, part-time, and intermittent employment is  creditable in meeting the service requirement under paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination after failure to meet conversion requirements. An  employing agency shall terminate employees covered by paragraph (a) of  this section not later than 90 days after they complete the 3-year  service requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if  they have not met the requirements and conditions of paragraphs (a) (2)  and (3) of this section before the end of the 90-day period. For an  employee who is reemployed after intervening service in the armed  forces, the 90-day period begins on the date of reemployment if the  employee's combined civilian and military service satisfies the 3-year  service requirement on that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative error. When an employee has met the service  requirement under paragraph (a)(1) of this section but, because of  administrative error or oversight, has not been converted to career  employment within the time limits prescribed in this section, the  employing agency may effect the employee's conversion as of the date on  which he or she met the service requirement, even though the time limit  for such conversion has expired.
