                                Sec. 418.24  Election of hospice care.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing an election statement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. An individual who  meets the eligibility requirement of Sec. 418.20 may file an election  statement with a particular hospice. If the individual is physically or  mentally incapacitated, his or her representative (as defined in  Sec. 418.3) may file the election statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of election. The hospice chosen by the eligible  individual (or his or her representative) must file the Notice of  Election (NOE) with its Medicare contractor within 5 calendar days after  the effective date of the election statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consequences of failure to submit a timely notice of election.  When a hospice does not file the required Notice of Election for its  Medicare patients within 5 calendar days after the effective date of  election, Medicare will not cover and pay for days of hospice care from  the effective date of election to the date of filing of the notice of  election. These days are a provider liability, and the provider may not  bill the beneficiary for them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exception to the consequences for filing the NOE late. CMS may  waive the consequences of failure to submit a timely-filed NOE specified  in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. CMS will determine if a  circumstance encountered by a hospice is exceptional and qualifies for  waiver of the consequence specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  A hospice must fully document and furnish any requested documentation to  CMS for a determination of exception. An exceptional circumstance may be  due to, but is not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fires, floods, earthquakes, or similar unusual events that  inflict extensive damage to the hospice's ability to operate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A CMS or Medicare contractor systems issue that is beyond the  control of the hospice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A newly Medicare-certified hospice that is notified of that  certification after the Medicare certification date, or which is  awaiting its user ID from its Medicare contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other situations determined by CMS to be beyond the control of  the hospice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of election statement. The election statement must  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the particular hospice and of the attending  physician that will provide care to the individual. The individual or  representative must acknowledge that the identified attending physician  was his or her choice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual's or representative's acknowledgement that he or  she has been given a full understanding of the palliative rather than  curative nature of hospice care, as it relates to the individual's  terminal illness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acknowledgement that certain Medicare services, as set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section, are waived by the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effective date of the election, which may be the first day  of hospice care or a later date, but may be no earlier than the date of  the election statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The signature of the individual or representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of election. An election to receive hospice care will  be considered   to continue through the initial election period and through the  subsequent election periods without a break in care as long as the  individual--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remains in the care of a hospice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does not revoke the election; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is not discharged from the hospice under the provisions of  Sec. 418.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of other benefits. For the duration of an election of  hospice care, an individual waives all rights to Medicare payments for  the following services:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hospice care provided by a hospice other than the hospice  designated by the individual (unless provided under arrangements made by  the designated hospice).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Medicare services that are related to the treatment of the  terminal condition for which hospice care was elected or a related  condition or that are equivalent to hospice care except for services--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provided by the designated hospice:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provided by another hospice under arrangements made by the  designated hospice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provided by the individual's attending physician if that  physician is not an employee of the designated hospice or receiving  compensation from the hospice for those services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Re-election of hospice benefits. If an election has been revoked  in accordance with Sec. 418.28, the individual (or his or her  representative if the individual is mentally or physically  incapacitated) may at any time file an election, in accordance with this  section, for any other election period that is still available to the  individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Changing the attending physician. To change the designated  attending physician, the individual (or representative) must file a  signed statement with the hospice that states that he or she is changing  his or her attending physician.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The statement must identify the new attending physician, and  include the date the change is to be effective and the date signed by  the individual (or representative).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual (or representative) must acknowledge that the  change in the attending physician is due to his or her choice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The effective date of the change in attending physician cannot  be before the date the statement is signed.
