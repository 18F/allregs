                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are no evaporative emission standards for diesel-fueled  engines, or engines using other nonvolatile or nonliquid fuels (for  example, natural gas).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an engine uses a volatile liquid fuel, such as methanol, the  engine's fuel system and the vessel in which the engine is installed  must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1045 that  apply with respect to spark-ignition engines. Manufacturers subject to  evaporative emission standards must meet the requirements of 40 CFR  1045.112 as described in 40 CFR part 1060 and do all the following  things in the application for certification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe how evaporative emissions are controlled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Present test data to show that fuel systems and vessels meet the  evaporative emission standards we specify in this section if you do not  use design-based certification under 40 CFR 1060.240. Show these figures  before and after applying deterioration factors, where applicable.  [73 FR 59193, Oct. 8, 2008]</p>
