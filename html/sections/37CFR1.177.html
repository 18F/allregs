                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Office may reissue a patent as multiple reissue patents. If  applicant files more than one application for the reissue of a single  patent, each such application must contain or be amended to contain in  the first sentence of the specification a notice stating that more than  one reissue application has been filed and identifying each of the  reissue applications by relationship,   application number and filing date. The Office may correct by  certificate of correction under Sec.  1.322 any reissue patent resulting  from an application to which this paragraph applies that does not  contain the required notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If applicant files more than one application for the reissue of  a single patent, each claim of the patent being reissued must be  presented in each of the reissue applications as an amended, unamended,  or canceled (shown in brackets) claim, with each such claim bearing the  same number as in the patent being reissued. The same claim of the  patent being reissued may not be presented in its original unamended  form for examination in more than one of such multiple reissue  applications. The numbering of any added claims in any of the multiple  reissue applications must follow the number of the highest numbered  original patent claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any one of the several reissue applications by itself fails  to correct an error in the original patent as required by 35 U.S.C. 251  but is otherwise in condition for allowance, the Office may suspend  action in the allowable application until all issues are resolved as to  at least one of the remaining reissue applications. The Office may also  merge two or more of the multiple reissue applications into a single  reissue application. No reissue application containing only unamended  patent claims and not correcting an error in the original patent will be  passed to issue by itself.  [65 FR 54676, Sept. 8, 2000]</p>
