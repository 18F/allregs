                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The VOC bubble for Alcan Foil Products in Louisville submitted  as a SIP revision on March 3, 1986, is disapproved. The source must  continue to meet all the requirements of Jefferson County Regulation  6.29.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Part D--disapproval--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Campbell and Kenton Counties  nonattainment area. The 1979 SIP revisions for these two counties are  disapproved because the Commonwealth failed to submit evidence of legal  authority to implement a vehicle inspection and maintenance program as  required under section 172(b)(11)(B) of the Clean Air Act. No major new  or modified sources of volatile organic compounds can be built in these  two counties by virtue of the provisions of section 110(a)(2)(l) of the  Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Northern Kentucky (Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties) ozone  nonattainment area. The demonstration of attainment of the ozone  standards by the end of 1982, submitted as part of Kentucky's ozone SIP  revision on June 23, 1982, (draft), September 27, 1982, and November 3,  1982, is disapproved. As a result, the extension of the attainment  deadline until December 31, 1987, remains in effect, along with the  related requirement to submit a SIP revision addressing all requirements  of Part D extension areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, on November 11, 1994, for the Kentucky portion of the  Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky moderate interstate ozone nonattainment  area from nonattainment to attainment was disapproved on September 27,  1996.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment  date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton  metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton,  Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the  ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment  date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate ozone  nonattainment area which consists of Jefferson County and parts of  Bullitt and Oldham Counties is approved. The date for attaining the  ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Kentucky's January 7, 1998, request for a 1-year attainment date  extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton  metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton,  Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the  ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, on October 29, 1999, for the Kentucky portion of the  Cincinnati-Hamilton moderate interstate ozone nonattainment area from  nonattainment to attainment was approved on July 5, 2000. The mobile  source budgets for the Kentucky portion of the area for the purposes of  transportation conformity are now 5.83 tons per summer day of volatile  organic compounds and 15.13 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides for  the year 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Determination--EPA is determining that as of July 5, 2000, the  Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone nonattainment area  (which includes the Counties of Boone, Kenton, and Campbell) has  attained the 1-hour ozone standard and that the attainment demonstration  requirements of section 182(b)(1), 182(j), and 172(c)(1), along with the  section 172(c)(9) contingency measure requirements, do not apply to the  area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Approval--EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements  contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts  Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties in Kentucky from the NOX  related general conformity provisions; nonattainment NSR for new sources  and modifications that are major for NOX; NOX  RACT; and the requirement for a demonstration of compliance with the  enhanced I/M performance standard for NOX.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, on March 30, 2001, and supplemented on July 9, 2001, for the  Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate interstate ozone  nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment was approved on  October 23, 2001. The motor vehicle emissions budgets for VOC and  NOX in the Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate  interstate maintenance plan are adequate for conformity purposes and  approvable as part of the maintenance plan. The 1-hour ozone standard  maintenance plan motor vehicle emission budgets for the entire  interstate Louisville area for the purposes of transportation conformity  are now 48.17 tons per summer day of VOC and 92.93 tons per summer day  of NOX for the year 2012.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Disapproval.
