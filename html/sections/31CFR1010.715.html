                            <p class="depth0">The Director, FinCEN, or his designee may issue a written ruling  interpreting the relationship between this chapter and each situation  for which such a ruling has been requested in conformity with Sec.  1010.711. A ruling issued under this section shall bind FinCEN only in  the event that the request describes a specifically identified   actual situation. A ruling issued under this section shall have  precedential value, and hence may be relied upon by others similarly  situated, only if FinCEN makes it available to the public through  publication on the FinCEN Web site under the heading ``Administrative  rulings'' or other appropriate forum. All rulings with precedential  value will be available by mail to any person upon written request  specifically identifying the ruling sought. FinCEN will make every  effort to respond to each requestor within 90 days of receiving a  request.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1506-0009)</p>
