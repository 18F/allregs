If a person has submitted the documents required by Sec. 930.76(a) and (b), then a State agency's assertion that the information contained in the submitted documents is substantively deficient, or a State agency's request for clarification of the information provided, or information and data in addition to that required by Sec. 930.76 shall not delay or otherwise change the date on which State agency review begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 930.60(a), State agency review of the person's consistency certification begins at the time the State agency receives the certification and information required pursuant to Sec. 930.76(a) and (b). If a person has submitted the documents required by Sec. 930.76(a) and (b), then a State agency's assertion that the information contained in the submitted documents is substantively deficient, or a State agency's request for clarification of the information provided, or information and data in addition to that required by Sec. 930.76 shall not delay or otherwise change the date on which State agency review begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To assess consistency, the State agency shall use the information submitted pursuant to Sec. 930.76. If a State agency wants to augment the necessary data and information required by Sec. 930.76 to start the six-month review period for OCS plans, then the State can only do so if it amends its management program to include the information under Sec. 930.58(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After the State agency's review begins, if the State agency requests additional information, it shall describe in writing to the person and to the Secretary of the Interior or its designee the reasons why the information provided under Sec. 930.76 is not adequate to complete its review, and the nature of the information requested and the necessity of having such information to determine consistency with the enforceable policies of the management program. The State agency shall make its request for additional information no later than three months after commencement of the State agency's review period. The State agency shall not request additional information after the three-month notification period described in Sec. 930.78(a). However, the State agency may request additional information after the three-month notification period if the person or the Secretary of the Interior or its designee changes the OCS plan after the three-month notification period such that the plan describes activities or coastal effects not previously described and for which information was not previously provided pursuant to Sec. 930.76.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Following receipt of the material described in paragraph (a) of this section, the State agency shall ensure timely public notice of the proposed activities in accordance with Sec. 930.61.
