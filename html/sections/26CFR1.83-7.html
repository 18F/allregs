                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and 83(b) would have applied to the  transfer of property pursuant to an exercise of the option. The  preceding sentence does not apply to a sale or other disposition of the  option to a person related to the service provider that occurs on or  after July 2, 2003. For this purpose, a person is related to the service  provider if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, and  section 267(c)(4) is applied as if the family of an individual includes  the spouse of any member of the family; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person and the service provider are engaged in trades or  businesses under common control (within the meaning of section 52(a) and  (b)); provided that a person is not related to the service provider if  the person is the service recipient with respect to the option or the  grantor of the option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Readily ascertainable defined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Actively traded on an  established market. Options have a value at the time they are granted,  but that value is ordinarily not readily ascertainable unless the option  is actively traded on an established market. If an option is actively  traded on an established market, the fair market value of such option is  readily ascertainable for purposes of this section by applying the rules  of valuation set forth in Sec. 20.2031-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not actively traded on an established market. When an option is  not actively traded on an established market, it does not have a readily  ascertainable   fair market value unless its fair market value can otherwise be measured  with reasonable accuracy. For purposes of this section, if an option is  not actively traded on an established market, the option does not have a  readily ascertainable fair market value when granted unless the taxpayer  can show that all of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The option is transferable by the optionee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The option is exerciseable immediately in full by the optionee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The option or the property subject to the option is not  subject to any restriction or condition (other than a lien or other  condition to secure the payment of the purchase price) which has a  significant effect upon the fair market value of the option; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The fair market value of the option privilege is readily  ascertainable in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Option privilege. The option privilege in the case of an option  to buy is the opportunity to benefit during the option's exercise period  from any increase in the value of property subject to the option during  such period, without risking any capital. Similarly, the option  privilege in the case of an option to sell is the opportunity to benefit  during the exercise period from a decrease in the value of property  subject to the option. For example, if at some time during the exercise  period of an option to buy, the fair market value of the property  subject to the option is greater than the option's exercise price, a  profit may be realized by exercising the option and immediately selling  the property so acquired for its higher fair market value. Irrespective  of whether any such gain may be realized immediately at the time an  option is granted, the fair market value of an option to buy includes  the value of the right to benefit from any future increase in the value  of the property subject to the option (relative to the option exercise  price), without risking any capital. Therefore, the fair market value of  an option is not merely the difference that may exist at a particular  time between the option's exercise price and the value of the property  subject to the option, but also includes the value of the option  privilege for the remainder of the exercise period. Accordingly, for  purposes of this section, in determining whether the fair market value  of an option is readily ascertainable, it is necessary to consider  whether the value of the entire option privilege can be measured with  reasonable accuracy. In determining whether the value of the option  privilege is readily ascertainable, and in determining the amount of  such value when such value is readily ascertainable, it is necessary to  consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the value of the property subject to the option can be  ascertained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The probability of any ascertainable value of such property  increasing or decreasing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The length of the period during which the option can be  exercised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements.

For transactions  prior to that date, see Sec. 1.83-7 as published in 26 CFR part 1  (revised as of April 1, 2003).
