For multi-split systems, each model of condensing unit shall be tested with two different sets of indoor units. For one set, a ``tested combination'' composed entirely of non-ducted

indoor units shall be used. For the second set, a ``tested combination'' composed entirely of ducted indoor units shall be used.

This coil-only requirement does not apply to split-system air conditioners that are only sold and installed with blower-coil indoor units, specifically mini-splits, multi-splits, and through-the-wall units. This coil-only requirement does not apply to any split-system heat pumps.
