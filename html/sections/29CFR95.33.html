When statutory authority exists, DOL has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOL considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should DOL not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.</p>
