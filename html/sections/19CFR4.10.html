                            <p class="depth0">Request for overtime services in connection with entry or clearance of a vessel, including the boarding of a vessel in accordance with Sec. 4.1 shall be made on Customs Form 3171. (See Sec. 24.16 of this chapter regarding pleasure vessels.) Such request for overtime services must specify the nature of the services desired and the exact times when they will be needed, unless a term special license (unlimited or limited to the service requested) has been issued (see Sec. 4.30(g)) and arrangements are made locally so that the proper Customs officer will be notified during official hours in advance of the rendering of the services as to the nature of the services desired and the exact times they will be needed. Such request shall not be approved (previously issued term special licenses shall be revoked) unless the carrier complies with the provisions of paragraphs (l) and (m) of Sec. 4.30 regarding terminal facilities and employee lists, respectively, and the required cash deposit or bond, on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.64 of this chapter, has been received. Separate bonds shall be required if overtime services are requested by different principals.
