                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Program orientation. The Aquatic Plant Control Program is  designed to deal primarily with weed infestations of major economic  significance including those that have reached that stage (such as  water-hyacinth) and those that have that potential (such as  alligatorweed and Eurasian watermilfoil) in navigable waters,  tributaries, streams, connecting channels and allied waters. This does  not imply   that the infestation must have countrywide distribution. However, the  infestation should constitute a known problem of economic importance in  the area involved. Initial planning should constitute investigation of a  specific problem weed or weed complex, not generalized surveys of  aquatic vegetation. The common submersed aquatics and floating or  emergent, wetland, marsh, and swamp vegetation do not generally meet  those criteria for special problems merely because they may qualify as  ``obnoxious aquatic plants'' under the language of the legislation  authorizing the program except as indicated in Sec. 273.13(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Work not eligible under this program. Weed control for operation  and maintenance of reservoirs, channels, harbors, or other water areas  of authorized projects under jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers or  other Federal agencies will not be undertaken as a part of the Aquatic  Plant Control Program, except as such areas may be used for experimental  purposes in research performed for the program. Aquatic plant control  work for the operation and maintenance of Federal projects are eligible  to be included under this authority for the purpose of cost-sharing with  participating State or local agencies, but are not eligible for  budgeting or funding under the Aquatic Plant Control Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applied research. Applied research developed by OCE with the  assistance of the Interagency Aquatic Plant Control Research Advisory  Committee and the appropriate Division Engineer will be an all Federal  cost. This research will be accomplished through contracts with Federal,  State and private research institutions. A research planning meeting  will be held the last quarter of each calendar year to provide  professional presentation of current research projects, review of  current operation activities, and review new research proposals.  Requested programs, estimated cost, and other information will be  developed in the field and submitted to HQDA (DAEN-CWD-R) Washington, DC  20314, for approval and financing as prescribed by ER 70-2-3. Attendance  of the Technical Advisory Committee meetings by Corps personnel has been  authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Planning. Planning will be an all Federal cost item, will be  developed by reporting officers in accordance with their needs and will  be fully justified for funds requested. Normally, the program will be  initiated with a reconnaissance report (Sec. 273.14(a)) and will be  accomplished under a State design memorandum (Sec. 273.14(b)).  Supplement design memorandums will be used to implement changes in the  program. These memorandums will establish a continuing program and will  be used to enable the Chief of Engineers to allot available funds on a  priority basis in accordance with the urgency of the needs of each area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Criteria for recommending a Federal project. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  recommendation favorable to adoption of the project under the authority  provided by section 302, as amended, will be warranted when the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The problem and practical measures of improvement are of such  nature that there is a clear and definite Federal interest warranting  Federal participation under the purview of this special authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed work will result in an independent and complete- within-itself project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis based on sound economic principles clearly  demonstrates that the project will provide information and/or control of  aquatic plants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each separable element of the project, as well as the entire  project, is economically justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Local interests are legally and financially able and willing to  meet fully all requirements of local cooperation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recommendations for preparation of a detailed planning report  for new work on a new problem in a District or Division where control of  other aquatic plant problems is currently underway should consider  whether such new work represents an equal or higher priority of need for  allocation of funds in the same State. Projects will not be recommended  which produce undesirable short-term or long-term damage to the human or  natural environment.</p>
