                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following is a listing of the principal guidelines followed by the Director when determining whether expenses will be recognized in the ratemaking process:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each expense item included in the rate base is evaluated to determine if it is necessary for the provision of pilotage service, and if so, what dollar amount is reasonable for that expense item. Each Association is responsible for providing the Director with sufficient information to show the reasonableness of all expense items. The Director will give the Association the opportunity to defend any expenses that are questioned. However, subject to the terms and conditions contained in other provisions of this part, expense items that the Director determines are not reasonable and necessary for the provision of pilotage services will not be recognized for ratemaking purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining reasonableness, each expense item is measured against one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Comparable or similar expenses paid by others in the maritime industry,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comparable or similar expenses paid by other industries, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lease costs for both operating and capital leases are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to market rates. In the absence of a comparable market, lease costs are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment (computed as if the asset had been purchased with equity capital). The portion of lease costs that exceed these standards is not recognized for ratemaking purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the Association by its members. Assets subject to return on investment provisions are subject to reasonableness provisions. If an asset or other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, the return element is not allowed for ratemaking purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For ratemaking purposes, the revenues and expenses generated from Association transactions that are not directly related to the provision of pilotage services are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed the expenses from these transactions. For non-pilotage transactions that result in a net financial loss for the Association, the amount of the loss is not recognized for ratemaking purposes. The Director reviews non-pilotage activities to determine if any adversely impact the provision of pilotage service, and may make ratemaking adjustments or take other steps to ensure the provision of pilotage service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Medical, pension, and other benefits paid to pilots, or for the benefit of pilots, by the Association are treated as pilot compensation. The amount recognized for each of these benefits is the cost of these benefits in the most recent union contract for first mates on Great Lakes vessels. Any expenses in excess of this amount are not recognized for ratemaking purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Expense items that are not reported to the Director by the Association are not considered by the Director in ratemaking calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Expenses are appropriate and allowable if they are reasonable, and directly related to pilotage. Each Association must substantiate its expenses, including legal expenses. In general, the following are not recognized as reasonable expenses for ratemaking purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Undocumented expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses for lobbying;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expenses for personal matters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Expenses that are not commensurate with the work performed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other expenses not directly related to pilotage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> In any Great Lakes pilotage district where revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots are commingled with revenues and expenses from U.S. pilots, Canadian revenues and expenses are not included in the U.S. calculations for setting pilotage rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Reasonable profit sharing for non-pilot employees of pilot associations will be allowed as an expense for ratemaking purposes. Profit sharing that benefits pilots will be treated as part of pilot compensation.
