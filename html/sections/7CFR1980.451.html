                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Borrowers' and lenders' contact. Borrowers and lenders desiring FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance as provided in this subpart may file preapplications or applications with the County Supervisor or District Director servicing the area in which the project is to be located. In either case, the requirements of Sec. 1980.46 of Subpart A of this part must be met. The County Supervisor or District Director receiving the request for assistance will promptly notify the State Director of the nature and facts of the request. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director will promptly arrange an early meeting with the borrower and lender representatives to discuss assembly, preparation and processing of preapplications and applications. The State Director may call upon the County Supervisor and District Director to assist the State Office in any way necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applications from cooperatives. Borrowers eligible for loans from the Bank for Cooperatives will be encouraged to obtain guaranteed loans from that source since the Bank for Cooperatives

is experienced in making and servicing such loans and can provide substantial counsel to the applicant. Applications must be submitted to the Bank for Cooperatives as a test for credit elsewhere when an insured loan is being considered. (See FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2000-Q available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office for Memorandum of Understanding between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and Farm Credit Administration.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Borrowers eligible for Small Business Administration (SBA) assistance. All borrowers for loan guarantees eligible for SBA assistance will be advised by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 at the time of receipt of the preapplication of the availability of such assistance and will be encouraged to apply to that agency. (See FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2000-P available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office for Memorandum of Understanding between SBA and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Loan Priorities. Applications and preapplications received by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be considered in the order received; however, for the purpose of assigning priorities as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will compare an application to other pending applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will cooperate fully with appropriate State agencies in guaranteeing and insuring loans in a manner which will assure maximum support of the State's strategies for development of its rural areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When applications on hand otherwise have equal priority, the applications from a veteran will have preference. A veteran is a person who has been discharged or released from the active forces of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard under conditions other than dishonorable and who served on active duty in such forces:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the period April 6, 1917, though March 31, 1921;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During the period of December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During the period of June 27, 1950, through January 31, 1955; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For a period of more than 180 days, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955; but on or before May 17, 1975. Discharges under conditions other than dishonorable include ``clemency discharges.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priorities will be assigned by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to eligible applications on the basis of a point system that takes into account project location, the creation and saving of jobs, the cost at which those jobs would be created or saved, seasonal and part-time job impact, and leveraging of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance. The application and supporting information submitted with it will be used to determine an eligible proposed project's priority for available funds or guarantee authority. The priorities described in this paragraph will be used by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to score projects. A copy of the calculation of the score should be placed in the case file for future reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Location priorities. The priority score for location will be the score for the highest-ranked category in which the project fits. If the location does not fit one of these categories, its receives no points for location. The categories, and their point scores, are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Located in a city or area under 25,000 population (10 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Located in a city or area under 25,000 population that is in an area of high unemployment as of the date of application (20 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Located in an area of high unemployment as of the date of application, provided the borrower certifies in writing to the State Director in simple narrative or letter form that the project will employ on a permanent, full-time basis (providing at its own cost such training or retraining as may be needed) persons (numbering no fewer than 25 percent of the project's employment) who are members of displaced farm families which recently derived from

farming or ranching the majority of their combined incomes but are no longer actively engaged in farming or ranching as operators or employees (35 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Jobs priorities. The priority score for jobs created and/or saved is the score for the highest-ranked category in which the project fits. If the project does not fit one of these categories, it receives no points for jobs. The categories, and their point scores, are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Project will contribute to the overall economic stability of the project area and generate permanent jobs beyond the entrepreneur and the entrepreneur's household (10 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Project will contribute to the overall economic stability of the project area and will employ on a permanent, full-time basis a number of persons that is significant in the context of the area's economy (20 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Project will contribute to the overall economic stability of the project area, will employ on a permanent, full-time basis a number of persons that is significant in the context of the area's economy, and will retain in that area a significant number of jobs that would otherwise be lost (35 points)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Job cost priorities. The priority score for the project's cost per job is the score for the highest-ranked category in which the project fits. First, divide the amount of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guaranteed loan by the number of jobs created or saved. This will result in the cost per job. Count only full-time jobs. Part-time jobs may be reduced to a fraction of a full-time job and counted. For example, a 20-hour-per-week job, or a job that is full-time for six months per year, is one-half of a job. Second, determine the State's nonmetropolitan household income as described in Sec. 1980.451(d)(3)(vi). Third, divide the cost per job by the State's nonmetropolitan household income. For example, if the cost per job is $10,000 and the State's nonmetropolitan household income is $20,000, the result will be 0.5. The categories, and their point scores are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Loans on which the result is greater than 1.5 but less than 2.0 (5 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Loans on which the result is from 1.0 to 1.5 (15 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Loans on which the result is less than 1.0 (25 points).</p><p class="depth0">If the result exceeds 2.0, a high cost per job in that State, no points are received for job cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional Points. There shall be added to the score the points indicated for any and all of the following criteria met by the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guaranteed loan is less than 50 percent of project cost (5 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Percentage of guarantee is 10 or more percentage points less than the maximum allowable for a loan of its size (5 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Project will, in addition to any permanent full-time jobs, create a significant number of part-time or seasonal jobs that will provide additional income to underemployed residents of the project area without their having to give up any present part-time or seasonal jobs (10 points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Administrative Points. The State Director may assign up to 20 points to an application in addition to those points scored under Sec. 1980.451(d)(3) (i) through (iv). These administrative points are intended to be assigned by a State Director only in cases of unforeseen exigencies, emergencies, benefits to other FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354-assisted projects (including the limiting of financial risks affecting FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loans and loan guarantees) or the loss of financing if FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds are not committed in a timely fashion. They may also be assigned in cases in which the project's goods or services are essential to other Federally assisted projects and activities in the area or to the successful implementation of an economic development strategy for the area that is sponsored and/or operated by an agency of the Federal or State government. An explanation for the assigning of these points by the State Director will be appended to the calculation of the project score maintained in the case file. If an application is considered in the National Office, the Administrator may

also assign up to 20 points. An assignment of points by the Administrator will be by memorandum, stating the Administrator's reasons, and that memorandum will be appended to the calculation of the project score maintained in the case file. In assigning priorities to applications and in selecting projects for funding, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will consider State development strategies. Funds (guarantee authority) allocated for use as prescribed in this regulation are to be considered for use by Indian tribes within the State regardless of whether State development plans include Indian reservations within the State's boundaries. It is essential that Indians residing on such reservations have equal opportunity to participate in any benefits of these programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Indexation. When current, annual data are not available to determine a State's nonmetropolitan household income for purposes of the calculations described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, indexation of census data is necessary. The State Director will use the figure from the most recent decennial census of the United States, increased by a factor representing the increase since the year of that census in the Consumer Price Index (``CIP-U''). That factor shall be furnished annually by the National Office, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Filing preapplications and applications. Borrowers or lenders may file preapplications described in paragraph (f) of this section if they desire an expression of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 interest prior to assembling the complete application and request for Loan Note Guarantee or they may present the complete application, in one package, including the material required in paragraphs (f), (i), (j), and (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Preapplications. Applicants may file preapplications with the County, District, or State Office including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A letter prepared by the borrower and the lender which shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Borrower's name, address, contact person and telephone number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of loan request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Name of the proposed lender, address, contact person, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Brief description of the projects, products and services provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Type and number of employment opportunities and unemployment rate where the project will be located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Amount of borrower's equity and guarantees offered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Anticipated loan maturity and interest rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Availabiity of raw materials and supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> If a corporation, names and addresses of borrower's parent, affiliates and/or subsidiary firms and a brief description of relationship, products and ownership among borrower, parent, affiliates and subsidiary firms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-22, ``Certification of Non-Relocation and Market and Capacity Information Report.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-4, ``Statement of Personal History,'' for a proprietor (owner), each partner, officer, director, key employee and stockholders holding 20 percent or more interest in the borrower except for those corporations listed on a major stock exchange and for those so listed if required by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-4 are not required to be submitted for elected officials and appointed officials in connection with loan applications from public bodies. Failure to report full, complete and accurate information on the Statement of Personal History may result in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's not making or guaranteeing the loan.

If preparation information indicates the project will not meet FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's minimum credit standards for a sound loan, is ineligible, does not have sufficient priority or that funds or guarantee authority are not available for the project, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will so inform the lender. The lender will be notified in writing with all reasons for the decision indicated. If it appears that the project is eligible, has sufficient priority, is economically feasible and loan guarantee authority is available, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will inform the lender and borrower in writing and request that they complete the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Department of Labor certifications. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will submit Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-22 to the Department of Labor for the necessary certification that the proposal will not be in conflict with Sec. 1980.412(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Content of Applications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-20, when required by Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Architectural or engineering plans, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cost estimates and forecasts of contingency funds to cover inflation or project changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Appraisal reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For existing businesses a pro forma balance sheet at startup and for at least three additional projected years, indicating the necessary startup capital, operating capital and short-term credit based on financial statements for the last three years, or more (if available); and projected cash flow and earnings statements for at least three years supported by a list of assumptions showing the basis for the projections.
