                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement that tips be reported--(1) In general. An employee who receives, in the course of employment by an employer, tips that constitute wages as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401, or compensation as defined in section 3231(e), must furnish to the employer a statement, or statements, disclosing the total amount of the tips received by the employee in the course of employment by the employer. Tips received by an employee in a calendar month in the course of employment by an employer that are required to be reported to the employer must be reported on or before the 10th day of the following month. For example, tips received by an employee in January 2000 are required to be reported by the employee to the employer on or before February 10, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An employee who receives, in the course of employment by an employer, tips that constitute wages as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401, or compensation as defined in section 3231(e), must furnish to the employer a statement, or statements, disclosing the total amount of the tips received by the employee in the course of employment by the employer. Tips received by an employee in a calendar month in the course of employment by an employer that are required to be reported to the employer must be reported on or before the 10th day of the following month. For example, tips received by an employee in January 2000 are required to be reported by the employee to the employer on or before February 10, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cross references. For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under sections 3101 and 3111, see sections 3102(c), 3121(a)(12), and 3121(q) and Secs. 31.3102-3 and 31.3121(a)(12)-1. For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages for purposes of the tax under section 3402 (income tax withholding), see sections 3401(a)(16), 3401(f), and 3402(k) and Secs. 31.3401(a)(16)-1, 31.3401(f)-1, and 31.3402(k)-1.

The statement described in paragraph (a) of this section can be provided on paper or transmitted electronically. The statement must be signed by the employee and must disclose:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The statement described in paragraph (a) of this section can be provided on paper or transmitted electronically. The statement must be signed by the employee and must disclose:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and social security number of the employee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the employer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The period for which, and the date on which, the statement is furnished. If the statement is for a period of less than 1 calendar month, the beginning and ending dates of the period must be included (for example, January 1 through January 8, 1998).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of tips received by the employee during the period covered by the statement which are required to be reported to the employer (see paragraph (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form of statement--(i) In general. No particular form is prescribed for use in furnishing the statement required by this section. The statement may be furnished on paper or transmitted electronically. An electronic system and all tip statements generated by that system must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. If the employer does not provide any other means for the employee to report tips, the employee may use Form 4070, ``Employee's Report of Tips to Employer.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. No particular form is prescribed for use in furnishing the statement required by this section. The statement may be furnished on paper or transmitted electronically. An electronic system and all tip statements generated by that system must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. If the employer does not provide any other means for the employee to report tips, the employee may use Form 4070, ``Employee's Report of Tips to Employer.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Single-purpose forms. A statement may be furnished on an employer-provided form. The form may be on paper or in electronic form. An employer that provides a paper form must make blank copies of the form readily available to all tipped employees. Any form, whether paper or electronic, provided by an employer for use by its tipped employees solely to report tips must meet all the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Regularly used forms. Instead of requiring that tips be reported as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on a special form used solely for tip reporting, an employer may prescribe regularly used forms for use by employees in reporting tips. A regularly used form may be on paper or in electronic form (such as a time card or report), must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, must contain identifying information that will ensure accurate identification of the employee by the employer, and is permitted to be used only if the employer furnishes the employee a statement suitable for retention showing the amount of tips reported by the employee for the period. The employer statement may be furnished when the employee reports the tips, when wages are first paid following the reporting of tips by the employee, or within a short time after the wages are paid. The employer may meet this requirement, for example, through the use of a payroll check stub or other payroll document regularly furnished (if not less frequent than monthly) by the employer to the employee showing gross pay and deductions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Period covered by, and due date of, tip statement--(1) In general. A tip statement furnished by an employee to an employer may not cover a period greater than 1 calendar month. An employer may, however, require the submission of a statement in respect of a specified period of time, for example, on a weekly or biweekly basis, regular payroll period, etc. An employer may specify, subject to the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the time within which, or the date on which, the statement for a specified period of time should be submitted by the employee. For example, a statement covering a payroll period may be required to be submitted on the first (or second) day following the close of the payroll period. A statement submitted by an employee after the date specified by the employer for its submission nevertheless is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if it is submitted to the employer on or before the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

A statement submitted by an employee after the date specified by the employer for its submission nevertheless is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if it is submitted to the employer on or before the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination of employment. If an employee's employment terminates, the employee must furnish a tip statement to the employer when the employee ceases to perform services for the employer. A statement submitted by an employee after the date on which the employee ceases to perform services for the employer is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if the statement is submitted to the employer on or before the earlier of the day on which the final wage payment is made by the employer to the employee or the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for electronic systems--(1) In general. The electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information transmitted by the employee and must document all occasions of access that result in the transmission of a tip statement. In addition, the design and operation of the electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably certain that the person accessing the system and transmitting the statement is the employee identified in the statement transmitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information transmitted by the employee and must document all occasions of access that result in the transmission of a tip statement. In addition, the design and operation of the electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably certain that the person accessing the system and transmitting the statement is the employee identified in the statement transmitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Same information as on paper statement. The electronic tip statement must provide the employer with all the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Signature. The electronic tip statement must be signed by the employee. The electronic signature must identify the employee transmitting the electronic tip statement and must authenticate and verify the transmission. For this purpose, the terms authenticate and verify have the same meanings as they do when applied to a written signature on a paper tip statement. Any form of electronic signature that satisfies the foregoing requirements is permissible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of electronic tip statements. Upon request by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the employer must supply the IRS with a hard copy of the electronic tip statement and a statement that, to the best of the employer's knowledge, the electronic tip statement was filed by the named employee. The hard copy of the electronic

tip statement must provide the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not be a facsimile of Form 4070 or any employer-designed form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Record retention. The record retention requirements applicable to automatic data processing systems also apply to electronic tip reporting systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. The provisions pertaining to electronic systems and electronic tip reports are applicable as of December 13, 2000. However, employers may apply these provisions to earlier periods.
