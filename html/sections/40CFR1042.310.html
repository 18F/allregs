For further testing to reach the minimum sample size, randomly select a proportional sample from each engine family, with testing distributed evenly over the course of the model year, unless we specify a different schedule for your tests. For example, we may require you to disproportionately select engines from the early part of a model year for a new engine model that has not previously been subject to production-line testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each engine that fails to meet emission standards, test two engines from the same engine family from the next fifteen engines produced or within seven days, whichever is later. If an engine fails to meet emission standards for any pollutant, count it as a failing engine under this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continue testing until one of the following things happens:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You test the number of engines specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The engine family does not comply according to Sec.  1042.315 or you choose to declare that the engine family does not comply with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You test 30 engines from the engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may elect to test more randomly chosen engines than we require under this section.</p>
