must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) from the date the insurable interest annuity terminated, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, to provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse for whom the retiree had elected (during the marriage to that former spouse) a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and the amount of annuity that would have been in effect had a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable, except that the retiree will not be charged for any period during which the survivor reduction was in effect for that former spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, and is not covered under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly difference between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section to provide a former spouse annuity, the annuity will be reduced separately to provide for the current and former spouse annuities. Each separate reduction will be computed based on the self-only annuity, and the separate reductions are cumulative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a former spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form.
