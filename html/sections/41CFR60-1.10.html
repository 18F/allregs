                            <p class="depth0">Contractors shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin  when hiring or making employee assignments for work to be performed in  the United States or abroad. Contractors are exempted from this  obligation only when hiring persons outside the United States for work  to be performed outside the United States (see 41 CFR 60-1.5(a)(3)).  Therefore, a contractor hiring workers in the United States for either  Federal or nonfederally connected work shall be in violation of  Executive Order 11246, as amended, by refusing to employ or assign any  person because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender  identity, or national origin regardless of the policies of the country  where the work is to be performed or for whom the work will be  performed. Should any contractor be unable to acquire a visa of entry  for any employee or potential employee to a country in which or with  which it is doing business, and which refusal it believes is due to the  race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or  national origin of the employee or potential employee, the contractor  must immediately notify the Department of State and the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of such refusal.
