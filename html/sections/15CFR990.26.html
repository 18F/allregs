                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Trustees may take emergency restoration action before completing  the process established under this part, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The action is needed to avoid irreversible loss of natural  resources, or to prevent or reduce any continuing danger to natural  resources or similar need for emergency action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The action will not be undertaken by the lead response agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The action is feasible and likely to succeed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Delay of the action to complete the restoration planning process  established in this part likely would result in increased natural  resource damages; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The costs of the action are not unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If response actions are still underway, trustees must coordinate  with the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), consistent with the NCP, to ensure  that emergency restoration actions will not interfere with or duplicate  ongoing response actions. Emergency restoration may not address residual  oil unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OSC's response is complete; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OSC has determined that the residual oil identified by the  trustee as part of a proposed emergency restoration action does not  merit further response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Trustees must provide notice to the public, to the extent  practicable, of these planned emergency restoration actions. Trustees  must also provide public notice of the justification for, nature and  extent of, and results of emergency restoration actions within a  reasonable time frame after completion of such actions. The means by   which this notice is provided is left to the discretion of the trustee.  [61 FR 500, Jan. 5, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 61492, Oct. 1, 2002]</p>
