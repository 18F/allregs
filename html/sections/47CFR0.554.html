                                Sec. 0.554  Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon request, the Commission will notify individuals as to  whether it maintains information about them in a system of records and,  subject to the provisons of Sec. 0.555(b), will disclose the substance  of such information to that individual. In order to properly request  notification or access to record information, reference must be made to  the Notice described in Sec. 0.552. A table of contents, which is  alphabetized by bureau or office, precedes the system descriptions and  allows members of the public to easily identify record systems of  interest to them. An individual may inquire into information contained  in any or all systems of records described in the Notice. However, each  inquiry shall be limited to information from systems located within a  single bureau or office and shall be addressed to that bureau or office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable identification is required of all individuals making  requests pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in order to assure  that disclosure of any information is made to the proper person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individuals who choose to register a request for information in  person may verify their identity by showing any two of the following:  social security card; drivers license; employee identification card;  medicare card; birth certificate; bank credit card; or other positive  means of identification. Documents incorporating a picture and/or  signature of the individual shall   be produced if possible. If an individual cannot provide suitable  documentation for identification, that individual will be required to  sign an identity statement stipulating that knowingly or willfully  seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false  pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</p><p class="depth3">Note: An individual's refusal to disclose his social security number  shall not constitute cause in and of itself, for denial of a request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All requests for record information sent by mail shall be signed  by the requestor and shall include his printed name, current address and  telephone number (if any). Commission officials receiving such requests  will attempt to verify the identity of the requestor by comparing his or  her signature to those in the record. If the record contains no  signatures and if positive identification cannot be made on the basis of  other information submitted, the requestor will be required to sign an  identity statement and stipulate that knowingly or willfully seeking or  obtaining access to records about another person under false pretense is  punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If positive identification cannot be made on the basis of the  information submitted, and if data in the record is so sensitive that  unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual  to whom the record pertains, the Commission reserves the right to deny  access to the record pending the production of additional more  satisfactory evidence of identity.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The Commission will require verification of identity only  where it has determined that knowledge of the existence of record  information or its substance is not subject to the public disclosure  requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as  amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All requests for notification of the existence of record  information or for access to such information shall be delivered to the  business address of the system manager responsible for the system of  records in question, except that requests relating to official personnel  records shall be addressed to the Associate Managing Director--Personnel  Management. Such addresses can be found in the Federal Register Notice  described in Sec. 0.552.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d))</em>  [40 FR 44512, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 49 FR 13368, Apr. 4, 1984]</p>
