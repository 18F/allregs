                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes  are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act   of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this  section, on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these  files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the  Commission's regulatory and enforcement program. Materials exempted  under this paragraph are contained in the system of records entitled  ``Exempted Investigatory Records'' and/or in the system of records  entitled ``Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.'' Notwithstanding the  foregoing, however, no record which has served as a basis for denying an  individual a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be  eligible, shall be maintained in this system, unless the disclosure of  such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished  information to the Government under an express promise that the identity  of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective  date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the  source would be held in confidence. For records of this type, if  practicable, material identifying the confidential source shall be  extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the  summary or extract shall be maintained in a comparable nonexempted  system of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of  determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment  with the Commission are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974  and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to the  extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order  to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide  information to the Commission which, absent assurances of  confidentiality, they would be unwilling to give. However, if  practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be  extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the  summary or extract shall be maintained in a non-exempt system containing  the same category of record. Materials exempted under this paragraph are  included in the system of records entitled ``Exempted Employee  Background Investigation Material'' and/or in the system of records  entitled ``Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, (3)(d),  (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f) of title 5 of the U.S.  Code (the Privacy Act of 1974), and are also exempted from the following  sections of these rules: Sec. 146.3 (requests for information and for  access); Sec. 146.5 (access to records); Sec. 146.6(d) (accounting of  disclosures to be made available to the individual); Sec. 146.11(a)  (7), (8), (9) (content of the system notice); and Sec. 146.7(a)  (relevancy of records).
