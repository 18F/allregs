                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a FOIA office determines or estimates the fees to be  assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $50.00, the FOIA  office shall notify the requester unless the requester has indicated a  willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If a portion of  the fees can be readily estimated, the FOIA office shall advise the  requester accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or  estimated fees are in excess of $50.00, the request shall be placed on  hold and further work will not be completed until the requester commits  in writing to pay the actual or estimated fees. Such a commitment must  be made by the requester in writing, must indicate a given dollar amount  or a willingness to pay all processing fees, and must be received by the  FOIA office within 20 working days from the date of the letter providing  notification of the fee estimate. If a commitment is not received within  this period, the request shall be closed without further notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the FOIA office begins processing a request, if it finds  that the actual cost will exceed the amount the requester previously  agreed to pay, the FOIA office will: Stop processing the request; and  promptly notify the requester of the higher amount. The request will be  placed on hold until the fee issue has been resolved. If the issue is  not resolved within 20 working days from the date of the notification  letter, the request shall be closed without further notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Direct costs, meaning those expenditures that NASA actually  incurs in searching for, duplicating, and downloading computer files and  documents in response to a FOIA request, will be included on the invoice  as appropriate. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the  employee who would ordinarily perform the work (the basic rate of pay  for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), the  cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as  photocopiers and scanners, the costs   associated with retrieving records stored at a Federal records center  operated by the NARA, as well as costs for CDs and other media tools.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NASA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st  day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will  be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from  the billing date until payment is received by the FOIA office. NASA will  follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97- 365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures,  including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies,  and offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If processing fees are less than $50.00, NASA will send all  releaseable documents (or portions thereof) following the completion of  the initial determination. If fees are greater than $50.00, the  documents will not be released until the invoice has been paid and  verified by the FOIA office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Final billing will be sent when the initial determination has  been completed. At that time the case will be closed.</p>
