                            <p class="depth0">The Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) provides for a  minimum annual rate of interest to be charged on overdue debts owed the  Federal Government. DON activities may levy this interest penalty for  any fees that remain outstanding 30 calendar days from the date of  billing (the first demand notice) to the requester of the amount owed.  The interest rate shall   be as prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717. DON activities should verify the  current interest rate with respective finance and accounting offices.  After one demand letter has been sent and 30 calendar days have lapsed  with no payment, DON activities may submit the debt to respective  finance and accounting offices for collection.</p>
