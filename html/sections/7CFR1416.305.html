For purposes of determining beginning livestock inventory, livestock inventory reports may require adjustment by COC, not to exceed normal mortality, for when loss occurs at different points during the growing season (for example, inventories from docking may need little to no adjustment, but sales records at the end of the growing season may require an adjustment to account for a full years of normal mortality).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The open range livestock operation must certify to the accuracy of the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The open range livestock operation is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete livestock beginning inventory to the county FSA office.

The transitional livestock beginning inventory history may contain a maximum of the 4 most recent calendar years and may include actual and transitional livestock beginning inventories. Transitional livestock beginning inventory history will only be used when less than 4 years of actual records are available. Appropriate adjustments to livestock beginning inventory history may be made to account for variations in ewe and cow stocking levels during the period covered by the history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The open range livestock operation is required to provide beginning livestock inventory records to determine the livestock beginning inventory history, if livestock beginning inventory records are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If no acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are available for either calves or lambs, calculate the 4 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 65 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only one of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 3 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 80 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 2 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 2 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 90 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 3 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the one transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If acceptable livestock beginning inventory history records containing information for 4 or more of the most recent calendar years are provided, calculate the livestock beginning inventory history by taking a simple average of the actual livestock beginning inventory histories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For livestock death losses that occurred on or after October 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2015, livestock producers who cannot meet the criteria in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section may provide acceptable documentation of proof of death and inventories according to the requirements in this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of death include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contemporaneous producer records existing at the time of the event, such as, but not limited to: Personal diary listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, and date of such event; personal diary of cowboy or herdsman showing animal care; calendar listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, date livestock turned out on pasture; pictures with a date; brand inspection records; dairy herd improvement records; ear tag documentation or records; and other similar reliable documents. COC may require the livestock producer to file a third-party certification to support the contemporaneous records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Third-party certification according to paragraph (f) of this section, except that the third-party is not required to certify to the specific number of livestock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of livestock inventory include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Veterinary records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Canceled check documentation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Balance sheets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Inventory records used for tax purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Loan records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Bank statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Farm credit balance sheets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Property tax records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xix)</em> Trucking and/or livestock hauling records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Brand inspection records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Sales and purchase receipts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Private insurance documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Chattel inspections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> IRS records such schedule F and depreciation schedules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Docking records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Shearing records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> Ear tag records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> COC may compare livestock numbers and carrying capacity to acreage reports filed by a producer during the calendar year of loss to determine reasonableness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> COC must review all documentation provided by the producer and based upon review of the documentation provided by the producer and personal knowledge of the producer's livestock operation, determine whether the number of death losses reported by the livestock producer are reasonable and whether the application for payment should be approved.</p>
