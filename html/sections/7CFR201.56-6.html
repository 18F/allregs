(If a few seedlings with total or partial decay to the epicotyl are found, they may be classified as normal, provided the hypocotyl and root are normal. The epicotyl on such seedlings usually does not decay when grown in a fairly dry environment and exposed to light. A retest, preferably in soil or sand, will aid in interpretation of such seedlings.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hypocotyl:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Deep open cracks extending into the conducting tissue.

(Hypocotyl stunting or curling may be caused by seedling orientation or constriction on or in the substratum.) (Hypocotyl collar rot is the breakdown of hypocotyl tissue initially characterized by a watery appearance and collapse of the hypocotyl below the cotyledonary node. The area later becomes discolored, shrivelled, and necrotic. The condition is caused by insufficient calcium available to the seedling. If hypocotyl collar rot is observed on seedlings of garden bean, the sample involved shall be retested in accordance with Sec. 201.58(b)(12).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Root:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> None.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Weak, stubby, or missing primary root with weak secondary or adventitious roots.

The stem bears one or more scale leaves and, prior to emergence, is arched near the apex, causing the terminal bud to be pulled through the soil; after emergence, the stem straightens. For practical purposes, the hypocotyl is not discernible and is not an evaluation factor. Buds in the axils of each cotyledon and scale leaf usually remain dormant unless the terminal bud is seriously damaged. In this case, one or more axillary buds may start to develop into a shoot.

(Breaks at the point of attachment of the cotyledons to the hypocotyl are common in seeds which have been mechanically damaged. It is important that seedlings not be removed during preliminary counts unless development is sufficient to allow the conditions of the cotyledons to be determined. If the point of attachment of the cotyledons cannot be seen at the end of the test, the seed coat should be peeled back to determine whether a break has occurred.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue free of necrosis or decay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Epicotyl:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Missing.

(The roots of sweetclovers may be stubby when grown on artificial substrata due to the presence of coumarin in the seed; since this condition usually does not occur in soil, such seedlings are classified as normal. Roots may appear stubby as a result of being bound by the seed coat; such seedlings are classified as normal. Crownvetch produces phytotoxic effects similar to sweetclovers.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Split extending into the hypocotyl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Seedling:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One or more essential structures impaired as a result of decay from primary infection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Albino.
