                                Sec. 192.937  What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment of a covered segment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe of that segment at the intervals specified in Sec. 192.939 and periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline under Sec. 192.921(e) by no later than December 17, 2009. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline period specified in Sec. 192.921(d) by no later than seven years after the baseline assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under paragraph (b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each covered segment. The periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in Sec. 192.917. For plastic transmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis specified in 192.917(d). For all other transmission pipelines, the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment results, data integration and risk assessment information (Sec. 192.917), and decisions about remediation (Sec. 192.933) and additional preventive and mitigative actions (Sec. 192.935). An operator must use the results from this evaluation to identify the threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented by these threats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assessment methods. In conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in the covered segment by any of the following methods as appropriate

for the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible (see Sec. 192.917), or by confirmatory direct assessment under the conditions specified in Sec. 192.931.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered segment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with Sec. 192.939.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, or stress corrosion cracking. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in Sec. 192.923 and with as applicable, the requirements specified in Secs. 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with Sec. 192.949. An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Confirmatory direct assessment when used on a covered segment that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than seven years. An operator using this reassessment method must comply with Sec. 192.931.
