                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 305(b)(1), if any shareholder has the  right to an election or option with respect to whether a distribution  shall be made either in money or any other property, or in stock or  rights to acquire stock of the distributing corporation, then, with  respect to all shareholders, the distribution of stock or rights to  acquire stock is treated as a distribution of property to which section  301 applies regardless of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the distribution is actually made in whole or in part in  stock or in stock rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the election or option is exercised or exercisable  before or after the declaration of the distribution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the declaration of the distribution provides that the  distribution will be made in one medium unless the shareholder  specifically requests payment in the other;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether the election governing the nature of the distribution is  provided in the declaration of the distribution or in the corporate  charter or arises from the circumstances of the distribution; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether all or part of the shareholders have the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X declared a dividend payable in  additional shares of its common stock to the holders of its outstanding  common stock on the basis of two additional shares for each share held  on the record date but with the provision that, at the election of any  shareholder made within a specified period prior to the distribution  date, he may receive one additional share for each share held on the  record date plus $12 principal amount of securities of corporation Y  owned by corporation X. The fair market value of the stock of  corporation X on the   distribution date was $10 per share. The fair market value of $12  principal amount of securities of corporation Y on the distribution date  was $11 but such securities had a cost basis to corporation X of $9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The distribution to all shareholders of one additional share of  stock of corporation X (with respect to which no election applies) for  each share outstanding is not a distribution to which section 301  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The distribution of the second share of stock of corporation X  to those shareholders who do not elect to receive securities of  corporation Y is a distribution of property to which section 301  applies, whether such shareholders are individuals or corporations. The  amount of the distribution to which section 301 applies is $10 per share  of stock of corporation X held on the record date (the fair market value  of the stock of corporation X on the distribution date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The distribution of securities of corporation Y in lieu of the  second share of stock of corporation X to the shareholders of  corporation X whether individuals or corporations, who elect to receive  such securities, is also a distribution of property to which section 301  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of the individual shareholders of corporation X who  elects to receive such securities, the amount of the distribution to  which section 301 applies is $11 per share of stock of corporation X  held on the record date (the fair market value of the $12 principal  amount of securities of corporation Y on the distribution date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In the case of the corporate shareholders of corporation X  electing to receive such securities, the amount of the distribution to  which section 301 applies is $9 per share of stock of corporation X held  on the record date (the basis of the securities of corporation Y in the  hands of corporation X).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 10, 1970, corporation X, a regulated  investment company, declared a dividend of $1 per share on its common  stock payable on February 11, 1970, in cash or in stock of corporation X  of equivalent value determined as of January 22, 1970, at the election  of the shareholder made on or before January 22, 1970. The amount of the  distribution to which section 301 applies is $1 per share whether the  shareholder elects to take cash or stock and whether the shareholder is  an individual or a corporation. Such amount will also be used in  determining the dividend paid deduction of corporation X and the  reduction in earnings and profits of corporation X.  [T.D. 7281, 38 FR 18532, July 12, 1973]</p>
