                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost, in addition to the requirements of Subtitle II. Basic Considerations of this subpart. These principles apply whether or not a particular item of cost is properly treated as direct cost or indirect (F&A;) cost. Failure to mention a particular item of cost is not intended to imply that it is either

allowable or unallowable; rather, determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related items of cost, and based on the principles described in Secs. 200.402 Composition of costs through 200.411 Adjustment of previously negotiated indirect (F&A;) cost rates containing unallowable costs. In case of a discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the Federal award governs. Criteria outlined in Sec. 200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs must be applied in determining allowability. See also Sec. 200.102 Exceptions.</p>
