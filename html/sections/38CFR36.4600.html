                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whenever loans are sold by the Department of Veterans Affairs,  they will be clearly identified as loans sold with or without recourse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The payment of all loans sold with recourse shall be guaranteed  in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Wherever the term ``holder'' appears in this section it shall  mean the purchaser of a loan sold by the Secretary and any subsequent  transferee or assignee of such loan. The holder of each loan sold  subject to guaranty shall be deemed to have agreed with the Secretary as  follows:   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 3720):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To furnish the Secretary with notice of default within 60 days  after a loan has become two full installments in default.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 3720)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To maintain on the real estate a lien of the dignity assigned or  transferred to the purchaser by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To maintain insurance in an amount sufficient to protect the  security against risks or hazards to which it may be subjected to the  extent customary in the locality, and to apply the proceeds of loss  payments to the loan balance or the restoration of the security, as the  holder may in the holder's discretion deem proper. Flood insurance will  be required on any building or personal property securing a loan at any  time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an  area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having  special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made  available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount  of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the  outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of  coverage available for the particular type of property under the  National   Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The notice requirements of 38 CFR  36.4709 shall apply to loans sold pursuant to this section.   (Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4012a, 4104a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To obtain a consideration equal to the fair market value of any  real estate released from the first lien securing the loan, except where  the loan will be paid in full, and to apply the entire consideration in  reduction of the principal balance of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> To maintain the tax and insurance account as provided for in the  loan instruments and to pay accrued taxes, special assessments, ground  or water rents and premiums on fire or other insurance properly  chargeable to the tax and insurance account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> To submit to the Secretary notice of any suit or action or other  legal or equitable proceeding to which the holder is a party (including  a copy of every procedural paper filed on behalf of the holder or served  on the holder), brought on or in connection with a loan sold under this  section or involving title to, or other lien on, the property securing  the loan, within the time that would be required if the Secretary were a  party to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> To submit to the Secretary for prior approval any proposal to  recast or extend the repayment terms of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> To take no action to accelerate the indebtedness or terminate  the debtor's interest in the property without the prior approval of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> To make advances only for the maintenance and repairs reasonably  necessary for the preservation of the security, or for the payment of  accrued taxes, special assessments, ground or water rents, premiums on  fire or other insurance against loss or damage to the property, or for  other purposes approved in advance by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> To furnish the Secretary prompt notice of the cancellation of  any repurchase endorsement or notice on the note or bond upon the  payment in full of any loan sold pursuant to this section or of the  release of the Secretary from liability to repurchase the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> To maintain adequate accounting records and to provide the  Secretary with such data relating to the loan as the Secretary may  request incident to the Secretary's determination of the amount payable  in connection with a request for the repurchase of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> To service the loans properly in accordance with established  practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> To permit the Secretary to inspect, examine or audit at  reasonable times and places the records of loans which are subject to  repurchase under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> To sell any loan to the Secretary for the amount specified in  paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon request of the Secretary if the  loan is six (6) full installments or more in default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> To dispose of partial payments in accordance with the  provisions of this paragraph. A partial payment is a remittance on a  loan in default of any amount less than the full amount due under the  terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is  tendered; a default is a failure of a borrower to comply with the terms  of a loan agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(15)(ii) of this section, or  upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the mortgage holder shall  accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's  account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a  special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for  disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they  shall be applied to the mortgagor's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor, within 10  calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of  explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The property is wholly or partially tenant-occupied and rental  payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the  loan account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including  escrows and late charge, if applicable, unless the lesser payment amount  has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The payment is less than 50 percent of the total amount then  due, unless the lesser payment amount has   been agreed to under a written repayment plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a written  repayment plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The amount tendered is in the form of personal check and the  holder has previously notified the mortgagor in writing that only cash  or certified remittances are acceptable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least 6 months  since the account first became delinquent and no written repayment plan  has been arranged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The loan has been submitted to the Department of Veterans  Affairs for repurchase;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The lien position of the security instrument would be  jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this  paragraph may result in a deduction from the repurchase price pursuant  to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3720)</p><p class="depth0">Note: In any instance in which the holder desires Department of  Veterans Affairs prior approval to a proposed action the holder may  submit the facts to the Loan Guaranty Officer as provided in paragraph  (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> To obtain and forward a current credit report(s) on the  debtor(s) to the Secretary when requesting that the Secretary repurchase  the loan.

If, however, there has been a failure of any holder to  comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section the  Secretary shall be entitled to deduct from the repurchase price  otherwise payable such amount as the Secretary determines to be  necessary to restore the Secretary to the position the Secretary would  have occupied upon repurchase of the loan in the absence of any such  failure. Incident to the repurchase by the Secretary, the holder will  pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the balance, if any, remaining  in the tax and insurance account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The holder shall be deemed to have received as trustee for the  benefit of the Secretary any amounts received on account of the loan  indebtedness subsequent to submitting its request to repurchase and  shall pay such amounts to the Department of Veterans Affairs upon the  assignment and delivery of the note, bond and security instruments to  the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The holder may be reimbursed for the cost of a current credit  report(s) on the debtor(s) which is (are) forwarded to the Secretary  along with the request for repurchase and for any other costs or  expenses incurred which are approved in advance by the Secretary as  being necessary to protect the Government's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the  Secretary shall be released from liability and shall not be obligated to  repurchase any loan in respect to which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An obligor has been released from personal liability by any act  or omission of the holder without the prior approval of the Secretary,  except that a holder shall not be under any duty to establish the debt  as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased or  bankrupt obligor when such failure will not impair the validity or  effectiveness of the lien securing the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The holder has instituted foreclosure action against the  property securing the loan without the prior approval of the Secretary,  and such action has proceeded to the point where the judicial sale or  sale under the power in the deed of trust has been held or the owner's  interest in the property has been terminated by the holder by strict  foreclosure, acceptance of a voluntary deed, or by other liquidation  action; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any material alteration has been made to the note, bond,  security instrument, or installment sale contract after sale and  delivery of the instruments by the Secretary to the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs  heretofore or hereafter appointed to or lawfully filling, any position  designated in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is hereby delegated  authority within the limitations and conditions prescribed by law to  exercise the powers and functions of the Secretary with respect to the  sale, assignment, transfer, and repurchase of loans, including, but not  limited to the offering of such loans for sale, the acceptance of  purchase offers, the assignment or transfer of notes or bonds and  security instruments evidencing the loans sold, granting the prior  approval of the Secretary under this section, determining the  eligibility of the loans for repurchase and to calculate and pay the sum  due the holder upon repurchase of the loan by the Department of Veterans  Affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Designated positions:  Under Secretary for Benefits.
