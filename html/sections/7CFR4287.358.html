                            <p class="depth0">Unless the Agency anticipates a Future Recovery, the Agency will make a final settlement with the Lender after the Collateral is liquidated and settlement and compromise of all parties has been completed. The Agency has the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party that may be liable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Report of loss form. Form RD 449-30, ``Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss,'' will be used for reporting and calculating all estimated and final loss determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estimated loss. In accordance with the requirements of Sec. 4287.357(f), the Lender must prepare an estimated loss claim and submit it to the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest accrual eligible for payment under the guarantee on the Defaulted loan will be discontinued when the estimated loss is paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Protective Advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final payment as indicated in the Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The estimated loss payment is a payment to the Lender and is not to be

applied as a payment on the loan for purposes of reducing the unpaid balance owed by the Borrower or for status reporting (semi-annual status/Default status reports).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final loss. Except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section, the Lender must prepare a final Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss and submit it to the Agency within 30 days after liquidation of all Collateral is completed. Interest will not be paid beyond the Interest Termination Date. Before approval by the Agency of any final loss report, the Lender must account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition of the Collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss, the Agency may audit all applicable documentation to determine the final loss. The Lender must make its records available and otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation. The documentation accompanying the Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss must support the amounts reported as losses on the Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Lender must make a determination regarding the collectability of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees. If reasonably possible, the Lender must promptly collect or otherwise dispose of such guarantees in accordance with Sec. 4287.357(j) prior to completion of the final loss report. However, in the event that collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the Lender must file the Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss when all other Collateral has been liquidated. Unsecured personal or corporate guarantees outstanding at the time of the submission of the final loss claim will be treated as a Future Recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a Pro Rata basis by the Lender and the Agency. The Agency may consider a compromise settlement of Federal Debt after it has processed a final Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss and issued a 60 day due process letter. Any funds collected on Federal Debt will not be shared with the Lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Lender must document that all of the Collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and liquidation proceeds have been accounted for and applied correctly to the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of any Protective Advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of Liquidation Expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper. Liquidation Expenses are recoverable only from liquidation proceeds. The Agency may approve attorney/legal fees as Liquidation Expenses provided that the fees are reasonable, require the assistance of attorneys, and cover legal issues pertaining to the liquidation that could not be properly handled by the Lender and its employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Lender must support accrued Interest by documenting how the amount was accrued. If the Interest rate was a variable rate, the Lender must include documentation of changes in both the selected base rate and the loan rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Agency will pay loss payments within 60 days after it has reviewed the complete final loss report and accounting of the Collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a Lender receives a final loss payment and the Agency determines there is Future Recovery, the Lender must submit to the Agency an annual report on its collection activities for each unsatisfied account for 3 years following payment of the final loss claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loss limit. The amount payable by the Agency to the Lender cannot exceed the limits set forth in the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquidation Expenses. The Agency will deduct Liquidation Expenses from the liquidation proceeds of the Collateral. The Lender cannot claim any Liquidation Expenses in excess of liquidation proceeds. Any changes to the Liquidation Expenses that exceed 10 percent of the amount proposed in the liquidation plan must be approved by the

Agency. Reasonable attorney/legal expenses will be shared by the Lender and Agency equally, including those instances where the Lender has incurred such expenses from a trustee conducting the liquidation of assets. The Lender cannot claim the guarantee fee or the Annual Renewal Fee as authorized Liquidation Expenses, and no In-House Expenses of the Lender will be allowed. In-House Expenses include, but are not limited to, employee's salaries, staff lawyers, travel, and overhead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rent. The Lender must apply any net rental or other income that it receives from the Collateral to the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment. Once the Agency approves the Guaranteed Loan Report of Loss and supporting documents submitted by the Lender:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, the Agency will pay the additional amount owed by the Agency to the Lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the loss is less than the estimated loss payment, the Lender must reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus Interest at the Promissory Note rate from the date of payment.
