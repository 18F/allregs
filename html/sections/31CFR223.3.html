Upon receipt of a complete application,  Treasury will evaluate the submission to determine whether the applicant  company:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is duly authorized under its charter or articles of  incorporation to conduct the business referenced under 31 U.S.C.  9304(a)(2);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Has paid-up capital of at least $250,000 in cash or its  equivalent;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is solvent and financially and otherwise qualified to conduct  the business referenced under 31 U.S.C. 9304(a)(2); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Is able and willing to carry out its contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In making the determination whether a company meets these  requirements, Treasury will evaluate the application as a whole, the  required financial statement(s) submitted by the company, the company's  charter or articles of incorporation, the past history of the company,  and any further evidence or information that Treasury may require the  company to submit (at the company's expense).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If Treasury determines, in its discretion, that the applicant  company meets all of these requirements, Treasury will issue a  certificate of authority to the company authorizing it to underwrite and  reinsure Federal bonds. The certificate of authority will be effective  for a term that expires on the last day of the next June. All such  statutory requirements and regulatory requirements under this part are  continuing obligations, and any certificate is issued expressly subject  to continuing compliance with such requirements. The certificate of  authority will be renewed annually on the first day of July, provided  the company remains qualified under the law, the regulations in this  part, and other pertinent Treasury requirements, and the company submits  the fee required under Sec. 223.22 by March 1st of each year to the  address and/or account specified by Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a company meets the requirements for a certificate of  authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds in all respects  except that it is a United States branch of a company not incorporated  under the laws of the United States or of any State, or it is limited by  its articles of incorporation or corporate charter to reinsure business  only, it may be issued a certificate of authority as a reinsuring  company on Federal bonds. The fees for initial application and renewal  of a certificate as a reinsuring company shall be the same as the fees  for a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds.
