                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of plans. There are two public housing agency plans. They  are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 5-Year Plan (the 5-Year Plan) that a public housing agency  (PHA) must submit to HUD once every five PHA fiscal years. The 5-Year  Plan covers the five PHA fiscal years immediately following the date on  which the 5-Year Plan is due to HUD; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Annual Plan (Annual Plan) that the PHA must submit to HUD  for each fiscal year immediately following the date on which the Annual  Plan is due to HUD and for which the PHA receives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 8 tenant-based assistance (under section 8(o) of the  U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) (tenant-based assistance);  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts from the public housing operating fund or capital fund  (under section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g)  (public housing)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Format. HUD may prescribe the format of submission (including  electronic format submission) of the plans. HUD also may prescribe the  format of attachments to the plans and documents related to the plan  that the PHA does not submit but may be required to   make available locally. PHAs will receive appropriate notice of any  prescribed format.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. The requirements of this subpart only apply to a  PHA that receives the type of assistance described in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authority for waivers. In addition to the waiver authority  provided in Sec. 5.110 of this title, the Secretary may, subject to  statutory limitations, waive any provision of this title on a program- wide basis, and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106  of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989  (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)) where the Secretary determines that such waiver is  necessary for the effective implementation of this part.</p>
