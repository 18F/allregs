FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 agrees to grant a sum not to exceed $------ subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the grant funds actually advanced and not needed for grant purposes shall be returned immediately to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) Statement of Activities approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, is attached, and shall commence within 10 days of the date of execution of this agreement by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and be completed by ------ (date). FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever it is determined that the grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of this Grant Agreement or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulation related hereto. The grantee may appeal adverse decisions in accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Appeal Procedures contained in subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">In consideration of said grant by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Grantee, to be made pursuant to section 533 of the Housing Act of 1949, Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) program, the grantee will provide such a program in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Part A--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. Beginning date means the date this agreement is executed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and costs can be incurred.</p><p class="depth0">2. Ending date means the date when all work under this agreement is scheduled to be completed.

If the Grantee is a private nonprofit corporation, expenses charged for travel or per diem will not exceed the rates paid FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees for similar purposes.

The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the grantee for direct program costs (as identified in the grantee's Statement of Activity and budget and fund use plan) and proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Grant funds should be promptly refunded to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and redrawn when needed if the funds are erroneously drawn in excess of immediate disbursement needs. The only exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding are when the funds involved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Will be disbursed by the recipient organization within seven calendar days from the date of the Treasury check, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are less than $10,000 and will be disbursed within 30 calendar days from the date of the Treasury check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Grantee shall provide satisfactory evidence to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that all officers of the Grantee organization authorized to receive and/or disburse Federal funds are covered by satisfactory fidelity bonds sufficient to protect FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's interests.</p><p class="depth0">10.

This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken or contemplated, new time schedules required and any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance needed to resolve the situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units than originally projected.</p><p class="depth0">18.

In such instances, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reimburse the grantee for eligible costs incurred prior to the effective date of the suspension or termination and may allow all necessary and proper costs which the grantee could not reasonably avoid. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will withhold further advances and grantees are prohibited from further obligating grant funds, pending corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Grant termination will be based on the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Termination for cause. This grant may be terminated in whole or in part at any time before the date of completion, whenever FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that the grantee has failed to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The reasons for termination may

include, but are not limited to, such problems as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Failure to make reasonable and satisfactory progress in attaining grant objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Failure of grantee to use grant funds only for authorized purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Failure of grantee to submit adequate and timely reports of its operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Violation of any of the provisions of any laws administered by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or any regulation issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Violation of any nondiscrimination or equal opportunity requirement administered by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in connection with any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Failure to maintain an accounting system acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Termination for convenience. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the grantee may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that the continuation of the project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds.

Except for termination convenience, grantees have the opportunity to appeal a suspension or termination under FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's appeal procedure, subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">19. Upon any default under its representatives or agreements set forth in this instrument, the grantee, at the option and demand of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, will, to the extent legally permissible, repay to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 forthwith the grant funds received with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum from the date of the default. The provisions of this Grant Agreement may be enforced by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, at its option and without regard to prior waivers by it or previous defaults of the grantee, by judicial proceedings to require specific performance of the terms of this Grant Agreement or by such other proceedings in law or equity, in either Federal or State Courts, as may be deemed necessary by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to assure compliance with the provisions of this Grant Agreement and the laws and regulations under which this grant is made.</p><p class="depth0">20. Extension of this Grant Agreement and/or modifications of the Statement of Activities may be approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 provided, in its opinion, the extension and/or modification is justified and there is a likelihood that the grantee can accomplish the goals set out and approved in the Statement of Activities during the period of the extension and/or modifications as specified in Sec. 1944.684 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Part C--Grantee agrees</p><p class="depth0">1. To comply with property management standards for expendable and nonexpendable personal property established by Attachment N of OMB Circular A-102 or Attachment N of OMB Circular A-110 for State and local governments or nonprofit organizations respectively. Personal property means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible--having physical existence--or intangible--having no physical existence, such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. Nonexpendable personal property means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definitions of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. Expendable personal property refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable personal property. When nonexpendable tangible personal property is acquired by a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall vest in the grantee subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Right to transfer title. For items of nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 1(c) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraph 1(a)(iv) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefitting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of other tangible nonexpendable property for which the grantee has title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Activities sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for which it was acquired, the grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. User charges should be considered if appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of other nonexpendable property. When the grantee no longer needs the property, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonexpendable property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The grantee may use the property for other activities without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The grantee may retain the property for other use provided that compensation is made to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the property. If the grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the grantee shall request disposition instructions from the original Grantor agency. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the property shall be reported, in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) to the General Services Administration by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine whether a requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue instructions to the grantee no later than 120 calendar days after the grantee request and the following procedures shall govern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the grantee's request, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal shares $100 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraph 1(a)(iv) above, the grantee shall be reimbursed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for such costs incurred in its disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall include the following procedural requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A description of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sources of the property including grant or other agreement number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Whether title vests in the grantee or the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal participation in the cost of the project or program for which the property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Location, use, and condition of the property and the date the information was reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Unit acquisition cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value when a grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to indicate Federal ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The grantee shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented; if the property was owned by the Federal Government, the grantee shall promptly notify FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When the grantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established which will provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Expendable personal property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of such property exceeding $1,000 in total aggregate fair market value, upon termination or completion of the grant and if the property is not needed for any other federally sponsored project or program, the grantee shall retain the property for use on nonfederally sponsored activities, or sell it, but must in either case compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as nonexpendable personal property.</p><p class="depth0">2. To provide a financial management system which will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each grant. Financial reporting will be on an accrual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Records which identify adequately the source and application of funds for grant-supported activities.
