If applicable, you also must submit any   additional indemnities, surety bonds, insurance certificates, or other  instruments required to extend the coverage of your original OSFR  demonstration to the COFs to be added. You do not need to resubmit  previously accepted audited annual financial statements for the current  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you want to drop a COF identified in your current OSFR  demonstration, you must submit to BOEM a completed Form BOEM-1022. You  must continue to demonstrate OSFR for the COF until BOEM approves OSFR  evidence for the COF from another designated applicant, or OSFR is no  longer required (e.g., until a well that is a COF is properly plugged  and abandoned).</p>
