                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If at any time following the filing of a complaint, the General  Counsel concludes that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out  the purposes of this part or 24 CFR part 180, the General Counsel may  authorize the Attorney General to commence a civil action for  appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of  the complaint. To ensure the prompt initiation of the civil action, the  General Counsel will consult with the Assistant Attorney General for the  Civil Rights Division before making the determination that prompt  judicial action is necessary. The commencement of a civil action by the  Attorney General under this section will not affect the initiation or  continuation of proceedings under this part or administrative  proceedings under part 180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the General Counsel has reason to believe that a basis exists  for the commencement of proceedings against the respondent under section  814(a) of the Fair Housing Act (Pattern or Practice Cases), proceedings  under section 814(c) of the Fair Housing Act (Enforcement of Subpoenas),  or proceedings by any governmental licensing or supervisory authorities,  the General Counsel shall transmit the information upon which that  belief is based to the Attorney General and to other appropriate  authorities.
