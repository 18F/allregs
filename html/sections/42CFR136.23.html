To the extent that resources permit, and subject to  the provisions of this subpart, contract health services will be made  available as medically indicated, when necessary health services by an  Indian Health Service facility are not reasonably accessible or  available, to persons described in and in accordance with Sec.  136.12  of this part if those persons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reside within the United States and on a reservation located  within a contract health service delivery area; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not reside on a reservation but reside within a contract  health service delivery area and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are members of the tribe or tribes located on that reservation  or of the tribe or tribes for which the reservation was established; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintain close economic and social ties with that tribe or  tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Students and transients. Subject to the provisions of this  subpart, contract health services will be made available to students and  transients who would be eligible for contract health services at the  place of their permanent residence within a contract health service  delivery area, but are temporarily absent from their residence as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Student--during their full-time attendance at programs of  vocational, technical, or academic education, including normal school  breaks (such as vacations, semester or other scheduled breaks occurring  during their attendance) and for a period not to exceed 180 days after  the completion of the course of study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transients (persons who are in travel or are temporarily  employed, such as seasonal or migratory workers) during their absence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other persons outside the contract health service delivery area.

When funds are  insufficient to provide the volume of contract health services indicated  as needed by the population residing in a contract health service  delivery area, priorities for service shall be determined on the basis  of relative medical need.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Alternate resources. The term ``alternate resources'' is defined  in Sec.  136.61(c) of subpart G of this part.  [64 FR 58319, Oct. 28, 1999. Redesignated and amended at 67 FR 35342,  May 17, 2002]</p>
