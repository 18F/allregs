The contract supplier is prohibited from influencing or incentivizing the beneficiary by persuading, pressuring, or advising them to switch from their current brand or for new beneficiaries from their preferred brand of glucose monitor and testing supplies. The contract supplier may not furnish information about alternative brands to the beneficiary unless the beneficiary requests such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure of subcontracting arrangements. (1) Initial disclosure. Not later than 10 days after the date a supplier enters into a contract under this section the supplier must disclose information on both of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each subcontracting arrangement that the supplier has in furnishing items and services under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether each subcontractor meets the requirement of section 1834(a)(20)(F)(i) of the Act if applicable to such subcontractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent disclosure.
