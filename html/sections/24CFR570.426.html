                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of Sec. 570.504(b) apply to all program income generated by a specific grant and received prior to grant closeout.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the unit of general local government has another ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, the program income will be considered to be program income of the ongoing grant. The grantee can choose which grant to credit the program income to if it has multiple open CDBG grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the unit of general local government has no open ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of the unit of general local government or its subrecipients which amounts to less than $25,000 per year will not be considered to be program income unless needed to repay a Section 108 guaranteed loan. When more than $25,000 of program income is generated from one or more closed out grants in a year after closeout, the entire amount of the program income is subject to the requirements of this

part. This will be a subject of the closeout agreement described in Sec. 570.509(c).</p>
