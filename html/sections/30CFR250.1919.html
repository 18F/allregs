Incident investigations must be initiated as promptly as  possible, with due regard for the necessity of securing the incident  scene and protecting people and the environment. Incident investigations  must be conducted by personnel knowledgeable in the process involved,  investigation techniques, and other specialties that are relevant or  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The investigation of an incident must address the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of the incident;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The factors (human or other) that contributed to the initiation  of the incident and its escalation/control; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recommended changes identified as a result of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A corrective action program must be established based on the  findings of the investigation in order to analyze incidents for common  root causes. The corrective action program must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retain the findings of investigations for use in the next hazard  analysis update or audit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine and document the response to each finding to ensure  that corrective actions are completed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implement a system whereby conclusions of investigations are  distributed to similar facilities and appropriate personnel within their  organization.</p>
