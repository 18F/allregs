                            <p class="depth0">For section 521 proceedings, this section shall apply in lieu of Sec. 18.9 of this title:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. At any time after the commencement of a section 521 proceeding, the parties jointly may move to defer the hearing for a reasonable time in order to negotiate a settlement or an agreement containing findings and a consent order disposing of the whole or any part of the section 521 proceeding. The administrative law judge shall have discretion to allow or deny such a postponement and to determine its duration. In exercising this discretion, the administrative law judge shall consider the nature of the section 521 proceeding, the requirements of the public interest, the representations of the parties and the probability of reaching an agreement that will result in a just disposition of the issues involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content. Any agreement containing consent findings and an order disposing of the section 521 proceeding or any part thereof shall also provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the consent order shall have the same force and effect as an order made after full hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the entire record on which the consent order is based shall consist solely of the notice and the agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A waiver of any further procedural steps before the administrative law judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A waiver of any right to challenge or contest the validity of the consent order and decision entered into in accordance with the agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the consent order and decision of the administrative law judge shall be final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission. On or before the expiration of the time granted for negotiations, the parties or their authorized representatives or their counsel may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit the proposed agreement containing consent findings and an order to the administrative law judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify the administrative law judge that the parties have reached a full settlement and have agreed to dismissal of the action subject to compliance with the terms of the settlement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inform the administrative law judge that agreement cannot be reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition. If a settlement agreement containing consent findings and an order, agreed to by all the parties to a section 521 proceeding, is submitted within the time allowed therefor, the administrative law judge shall incorporate all of the findings, terms, and conditions of the settlement agreement and consent order of the parties. Such decision shall become a final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Settlement without consent of all respondents. In cases in which some, but not all, of the respondents to a section 521 proceeding submit an agreement and consent order to the administrative law judge, the following procedure shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If all of the respondents have not consented to the proposed settlement submitted to the administrative law judge, then such non-consenting parties must receive notice and a copy of the proposed settlement at the time it is submitted to the administrative law judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any non-consenting respondent shall have fifteen (15) days to file any objections to the proposed settlement with the administrative law judge and all other parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If any respondent submits an objection to the proposed settlement, the administrative law judge shall decide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such objections whether to sign or reject the proposed settlement. Where the record lacks substantial evidence upon which to base a decision or there is a genuine issue of material fact, then the administrative law judge may establish procedures for the purpose of receiving additional evidence upon which a decision on the contested issue may be reasonably based;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If there are no objections to the proposed settlement, or if the administrative law judge decides to sign the proposed settlement after reviewing any such objections, the administrative law judge shall incorporate the consent agreement into a decision meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the consent agreement is incorporated into a decision meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the administrative law judge shall continue the section 521 proceeding with respect to any non-consenting respondents.</p>
