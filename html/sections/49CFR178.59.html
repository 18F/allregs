                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Type and service pressure. A DOT 8 cylinder is a seamless  cylinder with a service pressure of 250 psig. The following steel is  authorized:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A longitudinal seam if forge lap welded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attachment of heads by welding or by brazing by dipping process;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A welded circumferential body seam if the cylinder has no  longitudinal seam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Steel. Open-hearth, electric or basic oxygen process steel of  uniform quality must be used. Content percent may not exceed the  following: Carbon, 0.25; phosphorus, 0.045; sulphur, 0.050.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification of steel. Materials must be identified by any  suitable method except that plates and billets for hot-drawn cylinders  must be marked with the heat number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and  processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the  requirements of this subpart. No defect is acceptable that is likely to  weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and  uniform surface finish is required. Welding procedures and operators  must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exposed bottom welds. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18  inches long must be protected by footrings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Heat treatment. Body and heads formed by drawing or pressing  must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Openings. Openings in the cylinders must comply with the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard taper pipe threads are required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length may not be less than as specified for American Standard  pipe threads; tapped to gauge; clean cut, even, and without checks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a  hydrostatic test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method,  operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit  reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit  reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1  cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and  sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure  applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not  exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of  total volumetric expansion at test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> One cylinder out of each lot of 200 or less must be  hydrostatically tested to at least 750 psig. Cylinders not so tested  must be examined under pressure of between 500 and 600 psig and show no  defect. If hydrostatically tested cylinder fails, each cylinder in the  lot may be hydrostatically tested and those passing are acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Leakage test. Cylinders with bottoms closed in by spinning must  be subjected to a leakage test by setting the interior air or gas  pressure to not less than the service pressure. Cylinders which leak  must be rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Physical test. A physical test must be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test is required on 2 specimens cut longitudinally from 1  cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less,  after heat treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specimens must conform to a gauge length of 8 inches with a  width not over 1\1/2\ inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with width not  over 1\1/2\, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width  not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not  over \3/16\ inch thick.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding  to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The yield strength must be determined by either the ``offset''  method or the ``extension under load'' method as prescribed in ASTM E 8  (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In using the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain  (or ``extension under load'') corresponding to the stress at which the  0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient  accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under  appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length.  Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of  30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain  diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2  offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must  be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain  indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed \1/8\  inch per minute during yield strength determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Yield strength may not exceed 73 percent of tensile strength.  Elongation must be at least 40 percent in 2 inch or 20 percent in other  cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinder is  authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests  to be acceptable. Repair by welding is authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Porous filling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cylinders must be filled with a porous  material in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The porous material may not disintegrate or sag when wet with  solvent or when subjected to normal service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The porous filling material must be uniform in quality and free  of voids, except that a well drilled into the filling material beneath  the valve is authorized if the well is filled with a material of such  type that the functions of the filling material are not impaired;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overall shrinkage of the filling material is authorized if the  total clearance between the cylinder shell and filling material, after  solvent has been added, does not exceed \1/2\ of 1 percent of the  respective diameter or length, but not to exceed \1/8\ inch, measured  diametrically and longitudinally;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling  material;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The installed filling material must meet the requirements of CGA  C-12 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Porosity of filling material may not exceed 80 percent except  that filling material with a porosity of up to 92 percent may be used  when tested with satisfactory results in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C- 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the porosity of each cylinder is not known, a cylinder  taken at random from a lot of 200 or less must be tested for porosity.  If the test cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be tested  individually and those cylinders that pass the test are acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For filling that is molded and dried before insertion in  cylinders, porosity test may be made on a sample block taken at random  from material to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The porosity of the filling material must be determined. The  amount of solvent at 70 F for a cylinder:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Having shell volumetric capacity above 20 pounds water capacity  (nominal) may not exceed the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Maximum</p><p class="depth4">acetone</p><p class="depth4">solvent</p><p class="depth4">Percent porosity of filler                    percent</p><p class="depth4">shell</p><p class="depth4">capacity by</p><p class="depth4">volume ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 90 to 92...................................................         43.4</p><p class="depth4">87 to 90...................................................         42.0 83 to 87...................................................         40.0 80 to 83...................................................         38.6 75 to 80...................................................         36.2 70 to 75...................................................         33.8 65 to 70...................................................         31.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having volumetric capacity of 20 pounds or less water capacity  (nominal), may not exceed the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Maximum</p><p class="depth4">acetone</p><p class="depth4">solvent</p><p class="depth4">Percent porosity of filler                    percent</p><p class="depth4">shell</p><p class="depth4">capacity by</p><p class="depth4">volume ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 90 to 92...................................................         41.8 83 to 90...................................................         38.5 80 to 83...................................................         37.1 75 to 80...................................................         34.8 70 to 75...................................................         32.5 65 to 70...................................................         30.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Tare weight. The tare weight is the combined weight of the  cylinder proper, porous filling, valve, and solvent, without removable  cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Duties of inspector.
