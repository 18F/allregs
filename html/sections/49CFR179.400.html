Sec. 179.400-20  Pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The tank must be provided with pressure relief devices for the protection of the tank assembly and piping system. The discharge from these devices must be directed away from operating personnel, principal load bearing members of the outer jacket, car structure, trucks and safety appliances. Vent or weep holes in pressure relief devices are prohibited. All main pressure relief devices must discharge to the outside of the protective housings in which they are located, except that this requirement does not apply to pressure relief valves installed to protect isolated sections of lines between the final valve and end closure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Materials. Materials used in pressure relief devices must be suitable for use at the temperature of the lading and otherwise compatible with the lading in both the liquid and vapor phases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Inner tank. Pressure relief devices for the inner tank must be attached to vapor phase piping and mounted so as to remain at ambient temperature prior to operation. The inner tank must be equipped with one or more pressure relief valves and one or more safety vents (except as noted in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section), and installed without an intervening shut-off valve (except as noted in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section). Additional requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Safety vent. The safety vent shall function at the pressure specified in Sec. 179.401-1. The safety vent must be flow rated in accordance with the applicable provisions of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), and provide sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pressure relief valve. The pressure relief valve must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> be set to start-to-discharge at the pressure specified in Sec. 179.401-1, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> meet the requirements of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Installation of safety vent and pressure relief valve--(i) Inlet piping. (A) The opening through all piping and fittings between the inner tank and its pressure relief devices must have a cross-sectional area at least equal to that of the pressure relief device inlet, and the flow characteristics of this upstream system must be such that the pressure drop will not adversely affect the relieving capacity or the proper operation of the pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the required relief capacity is met by the use of multiple pressure relief device placed on one connection, the inlet internal cross-sectional area of this connection must be sufficient to provide the required flow capacity for the proper operation of the pressure relief device system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Outlet piping. (A) The opening through the discharge lines must have a cross-sectional area at least equal to that of the pressure relief device outlet and may not reduce the relieving capacity below that required to properly protect the inner tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the required relieving capacity is met by use of multiple pressure relief devices placed on a common discharge manifold, the manifold outlet internal cross-sectional area must be at least equal to the combined outlet areas of the pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duplicate pressure relief devices may be used when an approved 3-way selector valve is installed to provide for relief through either duplicate pressure relief device. The 3-way valve must be included in the mounting prescribed by AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A6.02(g), when conducting the flow capacity test on the safety vent prescribed by AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A6.01. Flow capacity tests must be performed with the 3-way valve at both of the extreme positions as well as at the mid-position and the flow capacity must be in accordance with AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An alternate pressure relief valve, set as required in Sec. 179.401-1, may be used in lieu of the safety vent, provided it meets the flow capacity prescribed in AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A at a flow rating pressure of 110 percent of its start-to-discharge pressure. Installation must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prevent moisture accumulation at the seat by providing drainage away from that area,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Permit periodic drainage of the vent piping, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prevent accumulation of foreign material in the vent system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Evaporation control. The routine release of vaporized lading may be controlled with a pressure controlling and mixing device, except that a pressure controlling and mixing device is required on each DOT-113A60W car. Any pressure controlling and mixing device must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be set to start-to-discharge at a pressure not greater than that specified in Sec. 179.401-1;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Have sufficient capacity to limit the pressure within the inner tank to that pressure specified in Sec. 179.401-1, when the discharge is equal to twice the normal venting rate during transportation, with normal vacuum and the outer shell at 130 F; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prevent the discharge of a gas mixture exceeding 50% of the lower flammability limit to the atmosphere under normal conditions of storage or transportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Safety interlock. If a safety interlock is provided for the purpose of allowing transfer of lading at a pressure higher than the pressure control valve setting but less than the pressure relief valve setting, the design must be such that the safety interlock will not affect the discharge path of the pressure relief value or safety vent at any time. The safety interlock must automatically provide an unrestricted discharge path for the pressure control device at all times when the tank car is in transport service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Outer jacket. The outer jacket must be provided with a suitable system to prevent buildup of annular space pressure in excess of 16 psig or the external pressure for which the inner tank was designed, whichever is less. The total relief area provided by the system must be a minimum of 25 square inches, and means must be provided to prevent clogging of any system opening, as well as to ensure adequate communication to all areas of the insulation space. If a safety vent is a part of the system, it must be designed to prevent distortion of the rupture disc when the annular space is evacuated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Piping system. Where a piping circuit can be isolated by closing a valve, means for pressure relief must be provided.
