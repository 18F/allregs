                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A participant who is separated from Government service can elect to withdraw a portion of his or her account balance in a single payment, or the entire account balance by one or a combination of the withdrawal methods described in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A post-employment withdrawal will not be paid unless TSP records indicate that the participant is separated from Government service. The TSP

will cancel a post-employment withdrawal election upon receiving information from an employing agency that a participant is no longer separated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A participant cannot make a post-employment withdrawal until any outstanding TSP loan has either been repaid in full or declared to be a taxable distribution. An outstanding TSP loan will not affect a participant's eligibility for an in-service withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A separated participant who is reemployed in a position in which he or she is eligible to participate in the TSP is subject to the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A participant who is reemployed in a TSP-eligible position on or before the 31st full calendar day after separation is not eligible to withdraw his or her TSP account in accordance with subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A participant who is reemployed in a TSP-eligible position more than 31 full calendar days after separation and who made a post-employment withdrawal while separated may not withdraw any remaining portion of his or her account balance in accordance with subpart B of this part until he or she again separates from Government service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A participant who has not separated from Government service may be eligible to withdraw all or a portion of his or her account in accordance with subparts D and E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A participant can elect to have any portion of a single or monthly payment that is not transferred to an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA deposited directly, by electronic funds transfer (EFT), into a savings or checking account at a financial institution in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a participant has a civilian TSP account and a uniformed services TSP account, the rules in this part apply to each account separately. For example, the participant is eligible to make one age-based in-service withdrawal from each account. A separate withdrawal request must be made for each account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All withdrawals will be distributed pro rata from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The distribution from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The distribution from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, all withdrawals will be distributed pro rata from all TSP Funds in which the participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each TSP Fund or source of contributions on the day the withdrawal is processed.
