                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each inspection shall be limited to the purposes  described in Sec. 716.2 of the CWCR and shall be conducted in the least  intrusive manner, consistent with the effective and timely  accomplishment of its purpose as provided in the Convention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description of inspections. During inspections, the  Inspection Team:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Will receive a pre-inspection briefing from facility  representatives;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Will visually inspect the facilities or plants producing  scheduled chemicals or UDOCs, which may include storage areas, feed  lines, reaction vessels and ancillary equipment, control equipment,  associated laboratories, first aid or medical sections, and waste and  effluent handling areas, as necessary to accomplish their inspection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May visually inspect other parts or areas of the plant site to  clarify an ambiguity that has arisen during the inspection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> May take photographs or conduct formal interviews of facility  personnel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> May examine relevant records; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> May take samples as provided by the Convention, the Act and  consistent with the requirements set forth by the Director of the United  States National Authority, at 22 CFR part 103, and the facility  agreement, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scope of consent. When an owner, operator, occupant, or agent in  charge of a facility consents to an initial or routine inspection, he or  she is consenting to provide access to the Inspection Team and Host Team  to any area of the facility, any item located on the facility,  interviews with facility personnel, and any records necessary for the  Inspection Team to complete its mission pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this section, except for information subject to export control under  ITAR   (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).  When consent is granted for an inspection, the owner, operator,  occupant, or agent in charge agrees to provide the same degree of access  provided for under section 305 of the Act. The determination of whether  the Inspection Team's request to inspect any area, building, item or  record is reasonable is the responsibility of the Host Team Leader.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ITAR-controlled technology. ITAR-controlled technology shall not  be divulged to the Inspection Team without U.S. Government authorization  (such technology includes, but is not limited to technical data related  to Schedule 1 chemicals or Schedule 2 chemicals identified in Note 2 to  Supplement No. 1 to Part 712 or Note 1 to Supplement No. 1 to Part 713,  respectively, of the CWCR; also see 22 CFR Section 121.1, i.e., the  United States Munitions List). Facilities being inspected are  responsible for the identification of ITAR-controlled technology to the  BIS Host Team, if known.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pre-inspection briefing. Upon arrival of the Inspection Team and  Host Team at the inspection site and before commencement of the  inspection, facility representatives will provide the Inspection Team  and Host Team with a pre-inspection briefing on the facility, the  activities carried out there, safety measures, and administrative and  logistical arrangements necessary for the inspection, which may be aided  with the use of maps and other documentation as deemed appropriate by  the facility. The time spent for the briefing will be limited to the  minimum necessary and may not exceed three hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pre-inspection briefing will address:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facility health and safety issues and requirements, and  associated alarm systems;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Declared facility activities, business and manufacturing  operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Physical layout;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Delimitation of declared facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Scheduled chemicals on the facility (declared and undeclared);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Plants and units specific to declared operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Administrative and logistic information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Data declaration updates/revisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pre-inspection briefing may also address, inter alia:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Introduction of key facility personnel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Management, organization and history;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Confidential business information concerns;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Types and location of records/documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Draft facility agreement, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Proposed inspection plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Visual plant inspection. The Inspection Team may visually  inspect the declared plant or facility and other areas or parts of the  plant site as agreed by the Host Team Leader after consulting with the  facility representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facility must provide the Inspection  Team with access to all supporting materials and documentation used by  the facility to prepare declarations and to otherwise comply with the  requirements of the CWCR. These supporting materials and documentation  shall include records related to activities that have taken place at the  facility since the beginning of the previous calendar year, regardless  of whether or not the facility has submitted its current year Annual  Declaration on Past Activities to BIS at the time of the inspection. The  facility shall also make available for inspection all records associated  with the movement into, around, and from the facility of declared  chemicals and their feedstock or any product chemicals formed from such  chemicals and feedstock. All supporting materials and documentation  subject to the requirements of this paragraph (e) must be retained by  the facility in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 721.2 of the  CWCR. The facility also must permit access to and copying of these  records, upon request by BIS or any other agency of competent  jurisdiction, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 721.1 of the  CWCR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facility must provide access to these supporting materials  and documentation in appropriate formats (e.g., paper copies, electronic  remote   access by computer, microfilm, or microfiche), through the U.S.  Government Host Team to Inspection Teams, during the inspection period  or as otherwise agreed upon by the Inspection Team and Host Team Leader.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The facility must provide the Inspection Team with appropriate  accommodations in which to review these supporting materials and  documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a facility does not have access to supporting materials and  documentation for activities that took place under previous ownership,  because such records were not transferred to the current owner of the  facility by the previous owner (e.g., as part of the contract involving  the sale of the facility), the previous owner must make such records  available to the Host Team for provision to the Inspection Team in  accordance with section 305 of the Act. However, the current owner of a  facility, upon receiving notification of an inspection (see Sec. 716.5  of the CWCR), is responsible for informing BIS if the previous owner did  not transfer records for activities that took place under the previous  ownership--this will allow BIS to contact the previous owner of the  facility, to arrange for access to such records, if BIS deems them  relevant to the inspection activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of facility agreements. Routine inspections at facilities  for which the United States has concluded a facility agreement with the  OPCW will be conducted in accordance with the facility agreement. The  existence of a facility agreement does not in any way limit the right of  the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the facility to  withhold consent to an inspection request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Hours of inspections. Consistent with the provisions of the  Convention, the Host Team will ensure, to the extent possible, that each  inspection is commenced, conducted, and concluded during ordinary  working hours, but no inspection shall be prohibited or otherwise  disrupted from commencing, continuing or concluding during other hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Health and safety regulations and requirements. In carrying out  their activities, the Inspection Team and Host Team shall observe  federal, state, and local health and safety regulations and health and  safety requirements established at the inspection site, including those  for the protection of controlled environments within a facility and for  personal safety. Such health and safety regulations and requirements  will be set forth in, but will not necessarily be limited to, the  facility agreement, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Preliminary findings. Upon completion of an inspection, the  Inspection Team will meet with the Host Team and facility personnel to  review the written preliminary findings of the Inspection Team and to  clarify ambiguities. The Host Team will discuss the preliminary findings  with the facility, and the Host Team Leader will take into consideration  the facility's input when providing official comments on the preliminary  findings to the Inspection Team. This meeting will be completed not  later than 24 hours after the completion of the inspection.  [71 FR 24929, Apr. 27, 2006, as amended at 72 FR 14409, Mar. 28, 2007]</p>
