                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  or INA 221(g) or other applicable law. Every refusal must be in  conformance with the provisions of 22 CFR 40.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refusal procedure. A consular officer may not refuse an  immigrant visa until either Form DS-230, Application for Immigrant Visa  and Alien Registration, or Form DS-260, Electronic Application for  Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, has been executed by the  applicant. When an immigrant visa is refused, an appropriate record  shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed by the Department. The  form shall be   signed and dated by the consular officer. The consular officer shall  inform the applicant of the provision of law or implementing regulation  on which the refusal is based and of any statutory provision of law or  implementing regulation under which administrative relief is available.  Each document related to the refusal shall then be attached to Form DS- 230 for retention in the refusal files. Alternatively, each document  related to the refusal shall be electronically scanned and  electronically attached to Form DS-260 for retention in the electronic  refusal files. Any documents not related to the refusal shall be  returned to the applicant. The original copy of a document that was  scanned and attached to the DS-260 for the refusal file shall be  returned to the applicant. If the ground of ineligibility may be  overcome by the presentation of additional evidence and the applicant  indicates an intention to submit such evidence, all documents may, with  the consent of the alien, be retained in the consular files for a period  not to exceed one year. If the refusal as not been overcome within one  year, any documents not relating to the refusal shall be removed from  the file and returned to the alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of refusal at consular office. If the grounds of  ineligibility upon which the visa was refused cannot be overcome by the  presentation of additional evidence, the principal consular officer at a  post, or a specifically designated alternate, shall review the case  without delay, record the review decision, and sign and date the  prescribed form. If the grounds of ineligibility may be overcome by the  presentation of additional evidence and the applicant indicates the  intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be  deferred. If the principal consular officer or alternate does not concur  in the refusal, that officer shall either (1) refer the case to the  Department for an advisory opinion, or (2) assume responsibility for  final action on the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Review of refusal by Department. The Department may request a  consular officer in an individual case or in specified classes of cases  to submit a report if an immigrant visa has been refused. The Department  will review each report and may furnish an advisory opinion to the  consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the  officer believes that action contrary to an advisory opinion should be  taken, the case shall be resubmitted to the Department with an  explanation of the proposed action. Rulings of the Department concerning  an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an application of the  law to the facts, are binding upon consular officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reconsideration of refusal. If a visa is refused, and the  applicant within one year from the date of refusal adduces further  evidence tending to overcome the ground of ineligibility on which the  refusal was based, the case shall be reconsidered. In such circumstance,  an additional application fee shall not be required.
