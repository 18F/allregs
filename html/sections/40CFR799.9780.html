                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section is intended to meet the testing requirements under section 4 of TSCA. This section is intended to provide information on suppression of the immune system which might occur as a result of repeated exposure to a test chemical. While some information on potential immunotoxic effects may be obtained from hematology, lymphoid organ weights and histopathology (usually done as part of routine toxicity testing), there are data which demonstrate that these endpoints alone are not sufficient to predict immunotoxicity (Luster et al., 1992, 1993 see paragraphs (j)(8) and (j)(9)

of this section). Therefore, the tests described in this section are intended to be used along with data from routine toxicity testing, to provide more accurate information on risk to the immune system. The tests in this section do not represent a comprehensive assessment of immune function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test guideline is the OPPTS harmonized test guideline 870.7800 (June 1996 Public Draft). This source is available at the address in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0">Antibodies or immunoglobulins (Ig) are part of a large family of glycoprotein molecules. They are produced by B cells in response to antigens, and bind specifically to the eliciting antigen. The different classes of immunoglobulins involved in immunity are IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. Antibodies are found in extracellular fluids, such as serum, saliva, milk, and lymph. Most antibody responses are T cell-dependent, that is, functional T and B lymphocytes, as well as antigen-presenting cells (usually macrophages), are required for the production of antibodies.</p><p class="depth0">Cluster of differentiation (CD) refers to molecules expressed on the cell surface. These molecules are useful as distinct CD molecules are found on different populations of cells of the immune system. Antibodies against these cell surface markers (e.g., CD4, CD8) are used to identify and quantitate different cell populations.</p><p class="depth0">Immunotoxicity refers to the ability of a test substance to suppress immune responses that could enhance the risk of infectious or neoplastic disease, or to induce inappropriate stimulation of the immune system, thus contributing to allergic or autoimmune disease. This section only addresses potential immune suppression.</p><p class="depth0">Natural Killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes which nonspecifically lyse cells bearing tumor or viral antigens. NK cells are up-regulated soon after infection by certain microorganisms, and are thought to represent the first line of defense against viruses and tumors.</p><p class="depth0">T and B cells are lymphocytes which are activated in response to specific antigens (foreign substances, usually proteins). B cells produce antigen-specific antibodies (see the definition for ``antibodies or immunoglobulins''), and subpopulations of T cells are frequently needed to provide help for the antibody response. Other types of T cell participate in the direct destruction of cells expressing specific foreign (tumor or infectious agent) antigens on the cell surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Principles of the test methods. (1) In order to obtain data on the functional responsiveness of major components of the immune system to a T cell dependent antigen, sheep red blood cells (SRBC), rats and/or mice \1\ shall be exposed to the test and control substances for at least 28 days. \2\ The animals shall be immunized by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of SRBCs approximately 4 days (depending on the strain of animal) prior to the end of the exposure. At the end of the exposure period, either the plaque forming cell (PFC) assay or an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shall be performed to determine the effects of the test substance on the splenic anti-SRBC (IgM) response or serum anti-SRBC IgM levels, respectively.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ If absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion (ADME) data are similar between species, then either rats or mice may be used for the test compound in question. If such data are lacking, both species should be used.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Because there is a fairly rapid turnover of many of the cells in the immune system, 28 days is considered sufficient for the purposes of the anti-SRBC tests.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event the test substance produces significant suppression of the anti-SRBC response, expression of phenotypic markers for major lymphocyte populations (total T and total B), and T cell subpopulations (T helpers (CD\4\) and T cytotoxic/suppressors (CD\8\)), as assessed by flow cytometry, may be performed to determine the effects of the test substance on either splenic or peripheral-blood lymphocyte populations and T cell subpopulations. When this study is performed, the appropriate monoclonal antibodies for the species being tested should be used. If the test substance has no significant

effect on the anti-SRBC assay, a functional test for NK cells may be performed to test for a chemical's effect on non-specific immunity. \3\ For tests performed using cells or sera from blood (ELISA or flow cytometry), it is not necessary to destroy the animals, since immunization with SRBCs at 28 days is not expected to markedly affect the results of other assays included in subchronic or longer-term studies (these tests are discussed in the reference under paragraph (j)(7) of this section). The necessity to perform either a quantitative analysis of the effects of a chemical on the numbers of cells in major lymphocyte populations and T Cell subpopulations by flow cytometry, or a splenic NK cell activity assay to assess the effects of the test compound on non-specific immunity shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the outcome of the anti-SRBC assay.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ When these optional tests are included, the phenotypic or NK cell analyses may be performed at 28 days of exposure, or at a later timepoint if ADME data suggest that a longer exposure is more appropriate.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1,000 mg/kg body weight (or 2 mg/L for inhalation route of exposure) using the procedures described for this study produces no observable toxic effects or if toxic effects would not be expected based upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using three dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure may indicate the need for a higher dose level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. These tests are intended for use in rats and/or mice. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be employed. \4\ All test animals shall be free of pathogens, internal and external parasites. Females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant. The species, strain, and source of the animals shall be identified.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ The study director shall be aware of strain differences in response to SRBC. For example, if the B6C3F1 hybrid mouse is used in the PFC assay, a response of 800-1,000 PFC/10\6\ spleen cells in control mice should be the minimally acceptable PFC response.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age/weight. (A) Young, healthy animals shall be employed. At the commencement of the study, the weight variation of the animals used shall not exceed 20% of the mean weight for each sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Young, healthy animals shall be employed.

Either sex may be used in the study; if one sex is known or believed to be more sensitive to the test compound, then that sex shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Numbers. (A) At least eight animals shall be included in each dose and control group. The number of animals tested shall yield sufficient statistical power to detect a 20% change based upon the interanimal variation which may be encountered in these assays.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least eight animals shall be included in each dose and control group.

Dead animals, their preserved organs and tissues, and microscopic slides shall be identified by reference to the animal's unique number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Husbandry. (A) Animals may be group-caged by sex, but the number of animals per cage shall not interfere with clear observation of each animal. The biological properties of the test substance or toxic effects (e.g., morbidity, excitability) may indicate a need for individual caging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Animals may be group-caged by sex, but the number of animals per cage shall not interfere with clear observation of each animal. The biological properties of the test substance or toxic effects (e.g., morbidity, excitability) may indicate a need for individual caging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The temperature of the experimental animal rooms shall be at 22 3 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The relative humidity of the experimental animal rooms shall be between 30 and 70%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where lighting is artificial, the sequence shall be 12 hrs light, 12 hrs dark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Control and test animals shall be maintained on the same type of bedding and receive feed from the same lot. The feed shall be analyzed to assure adequacy of nutritional requirements of the species tested and for impurities that might influence the outcome of the test. Rodents shall be fed and watered ad libitum with food replaced at least weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The study shall not be initiated until the animals have been allowed an adequate period of acclimatization or

quarantine to environmental conditions. The period of acclimatization shall be at least 1 week in duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control and test substances. (i) The test substance shall be dissolved or suspended in a suitable vehicle. Ideally, if a vehicle or diluent is needed, it shall not elicit toxic effects or substantially alter the chemical or toxicological properties of the test substance. It is recommended that an aqueous solution should be used. If solubility is a problem a solution in oil may be used. Other vehicles may be considered, but only as a last resort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The test substance shall be dissolved or suspended in a suitable vehicle.

It is recommended that an aqueous solution should be used. If solubility is a problem a solution in oil may be used. Other vehicles may be considered, but only as a last resort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One lot of the test substance shall be used, if possible, throughout the duration of the study, and the research sample shall be stored under conditions that maintain its purity and stability. Prior to the initiation of the study, there shall be a characterization of the test substance, including the purity of the test compound and if technically feasible, the name and quantities of any known contaminants and impurities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the test or positive control substance is to be incorporated into feed or another vehicle, the period during which the test substance is stable in such a mixture shall be determined prior to the initiation of the study. Its homogeneity and concentration shall also be determined prior to the initiation of the study and periodically during the study. Statistically randomized samples of the mixture shall be analyzed to ensure that proper mixing, formulation, and storage procedures are being followed, and that the appropriate concentration of the test or control substance is contained in the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control groups. (i) A concurrent, vehicle-treated control group is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A concurrent, vehicle-treated control group is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A separate untreated control group is required if the toxicity of the vehicle is unknown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A positive control group with a known immunosuppressant (e.g., cyclophosphamide) shall be included in the study. A group of at least eight animals shall be given the immunosuppressive chemical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dose levels. (i) In repeated-dose toxicity tests, it is desirable to have a dose-response relationship and a no observed immunotoxic effect level. Therefore, at least three dose levels and a negative control shall be used, unless a limit test is performed as specified under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In repeated-dose toxicity tests, it is desirable to have a dose-response relationship and a no observed immunotoxic effect level. Therefore, at least three dose levels and a negative control shall be used, unless a limit test is performed as specified under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The highest dose level shall not produce significant stress, malnutrition, or fatalities, but ideally should produce some measurable sign of general toxicity (e.g., a 10% loss of body weight).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The lowest dose level ideally shall not produce any evidence of immunotoxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Administration of the test substance. (i) The test substance, vehicle, or positive control substance shall be administered for at least 28 days for the anti-SRBC assay. The route of administration of the test material will usually be oral; however, this shall be determined by the likely route of occupational or indoor exposure. Therefore, under certain conditions, the dermal or inhalation route of exposure may be more relevant for the study. All animals shall be dosed by the same method during the entire experimental period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The test substance, vehicle, or positive control substance shall be administered for at least 28 days for the anti-SRBC assay. The route of administration of the test material will usually be oral; however, this shall be determined by the likely route of occupational or indoor exposure. Therefore, under certain conditions, the dermal or inhalation route of exposure may be more relevant for the study. All animals shall be dosed by the same method during the entire experimental period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the test substance is administered by gavage, the animals are dosed with the test substance ideally on a 7-days-per-week basis. However, based primarily on practical considerations, dosing by gavage on a 5-days-per-week basis shall be acceptable. If the test substance is administered in the drinking water, or mixed directly into the diet, then exposure shall be on a 7-days-per-week basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For substances of low toxicity, it is important to ensure that when administered in the diet, the quantities of the test substance involved do not interfere with normal nutrition. When the test substance is administered in the diet, either a constant dietary concentration in parts per million (ppm) or a constant dose level in terms of the animal's body weight shall be used; the alternative used should be specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For a substance administered by gavage, the dose shall be given at approximately the same time each day, and adjusted at intervals (weekly for mice, twice per week for rats) to maintain a constant dose level in terms of the animal's body weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the test substance is administered dermally, use paragraphs (f)(5)(iii)(A) through (f)(5)(iii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dose levels and dose selection. (1) In this test, it is desirable to determine a dose-response relationship as well as a NOEL. Therefore, at least three dose levels plus a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest dose level) group should be used. Doses should be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The highest dose level should elicit signs of toxicity but not produce severe skin irritation or an incidence of fatality which would prevent a meaningful evaluation. If application of the test substance produces severe skin irritation, the concentration may be reduced, although this may result in a reduction in, or absence of, other toxic effects at the high dose level. If the skin has been badly damaged early in the study, it may be necessary to terminate the study and undertake a new one at lower concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The intermediate dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preparation of animal skin. Shortly before testing, fur should be clipped from not less than 10% of the body surface area for application of the test substance. In order to dose approximately 10% of the body surface, the area starting at the scapulae (shoulders) to the wing of the ileum (hipbone) and half-way down the flank on each side of the animal should be shaved. Shaving should be carried out approximately 24 hrs before dosing. Repeated clipping or shaving is usually needed at approximately weekly intervals. When clipping or shaving the fur, care should be taken to avoid abrading the skin which could alter its permeability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Preparation of test substance. (1) Liquid test substances are generally used undiluted, except as indicated in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Solids should be pulverized when possible. The substance should be moistened sufficiently with water or, when necessary, a suitable vehicle to ensure good contact with the skin. When a vehicle is used, the influence of the vehicle on toxicity of, and penetration of the skin by, the test substance should be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The volume of application should be kept constant, e.g. less than 300 51Cr-labeled YAC-1 lymphoma cells. The amount of radiolabel released from the target cells after incubation with the effector cells for four hrs is used as a measure of NK cytolysis. The following points shall be adhered to when using the NK cell assay:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assay controls shall be included to account for spontaneous release of radiolabel from target cells in the absence of effector cells, and also for the determination of total release of radiolabel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Target cells other than YAC-1 lymphoma cells may be appropriate for use in the assay. In all cases, target cell viability shall be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Modifications of the protocol exist that may prove useful. However, complete citation shall be made to the method used. Modifications shall be reported, and where appropriate, the source, activity, and/or purity of the reagents should be given. Justification or rationale shall be provided for each protocol modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enumeration of splenic or peripheral blood total B cells, total T cells, and T cell subpopulations. The phenotypic analysis of total B cell, total T cell, and T cell subpopulations from the spleen or peripheral blood by flow cytometry should be performed after at least 28 days of dosing; this may be performed at a later timepoint, if ADME data suggest that a longer exposure is more appropriate. If an exposure period longer than 28 days is used, then these tests may be performed in conjunction with subchronic (ninety day oral, dermal, or inhalation) toxicity studies, when these studies are required. Methods described in the references under paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(5) of this section may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results--(i) Data shall be summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing effects, the types of effects and the percentage of animals displaying each type of effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results--(i) Data shall be summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing effects, the types of effects and the percentage of animals displaying each type of effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data shall be summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing effects, the types of effects and the percentage of animals displaying each type of effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted statistical methods may be used; the statistical methods including significance criteria shall be selected during the design of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation of study results. The findings of an immunotoxicity study shall be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of other toxic effects. The evaluation shall include the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or absence, and the incidence and severity of abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted test shall provide a satisfactory estimation of a no-observed-effect level. It may indicate the need for an additional study and provide information on the selection of dose levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific information shall be reported.

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
INQUIRIES</p><p class="depth0">For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.</p><p class="depth0">For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202-741-6000 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mail fedreg.info@nara.gov.
