                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">While the Act authorizes the Commission to undertake a wide range of  general planning and mitigation activities, it also specifies certain  projects or groups of projects that the Commission is to implement. The  Commission considers these obligations from the Act to be integral  components of the mitigation and conservation plan and of the planning  process used to develop this plan. From the perspective of the plan, two  issues are germane. These are the extent to which these obligations must  take priority over other projects, either in terms of funding or  sequencing and the extent to which there is flexibility in the specific  actions to be taken in fulfillment of these obligations. Through this  planning rule and other means the Commission will ensure that interested  parties are made aware of the implications of these obligations in order  that they might use this information when participating in the  development and implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description of mitigation obligations. Obligations principally  derive from three portions of the Act: Title II, section 304, and  section 315. Following is a description of the obligations contained in  each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title II. Title II authorizes funding and provides guidance for  completion of certain features of the Central Utah Project. It also  provides for Commission involvement in several specific activities  relating to Central Utah Project mitigation, including funding for  specific Section 8 mitigation activities. In the future, additional  Title II features will be implemented. These will be subject to  environmental review through NEPA or other applicable Federal laws and  will, in many instances, be coupled with mitigation measures. Section  301(f)(3) of the Act directs that priority be given for funding of  mitigation measures that are associated with Central Utah Project  features identified in either Title II or III of the Act that have been,  or will be, authorized through compliance with NEPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 304. This section directs that mitigation and  conservation projects contained in the DPR be completed and that this be  accomplished in accordance with the DPR and the schedule specified in  section 315 of the Act. Several elements of the DPR have been either  completed or initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 315. This section identifies several mitigation and  conservation projects that are to be implemented to   enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources. It also identifies the  funds that are to be authorized for each project. Initial phases of  selected section 315 projects have already received Commission funding  approval. Additional section 315 projects have undergone substantial  review and detailed implementation plans have, in some cases, been  prepared.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commission policy on fulfilling obligations. As referenced in  Sec. 10005.5, Section 301(f)(1) and (2) of the Act provides for re- programming of Section 8 funds to other projects in accordance with the  plan and/or following appropriate public involvement and agency  consultation, and provided ``that the benefits to fish, wildlife, or  recreation will be better served'' by doing so. The Commission  interprets this as giving the Commission broad discretion to determine,  with appropriate agency consultation and public involvement, whether to  implement projects delineated in the above stated sections and, should  the Commission choose to implement these, the form that this  implementation will take.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This notwithstanding, the Commission recognizes that the  projects referenced in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have, in  most cases, undergone considerable planning as well as agency and public  scrutiny. Their inclusion in the Act represents a consensus among  Federal and state agencies, water developers, and the national and state  environmental communities that these mitigation measures have merit.  Further, NEPA proceedings have, in some instances, been completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Absent the plan, the Commission will rely on Title II, Section  304, and Section 315 as the principal guidance in authorizing projects.  Once adopted, the plan will become the principal form of guidance. In  selecting projects for the plan, mitigation measures referenced in Title  II, Section 304, and Section 315 will be given priority consideration.  They will, however, be subjected to the same analysis as other proposed  projects. Should these projects be found to not meet the Commission's  standards for project approval, they will be rejected. Title II, Section  304, and Section 315 projects that meet Commission standards will only  be superseded in the plan if it can be demonstrated that the  contributions to be made by other projects proposed through the project  solicitation process significantly outweigh those of the aforementioned  Title II, Section 304, and/or Section 315 projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regardless, the Commission will retain flexibility regarding how  Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 projects will be implemented.  Interested parties may, if they choose, propose modifications or  enhancements to these projects through the normal project solicitation  process. The Commission will pay particular attention to proposals that  will accomplish Title II, Section 304, or Section 315 measures at lower  cost, thereby freeing up funds for heretofore unidentified projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission is aware that future NEPA procedures related to  the development of Title II features may result in the identification of  additional impacts and mitigation measures. The Commission considers  implementation of measures that result from a formal NEPA procedure to  be non-discretionary. The Commission recognizes a commitment to  implement such measures as are within its authority. Further, in  accordance with Section 301(f)(3), the Commission is committed to giving  these measures high priority. In order to ensure that such measures are  consistent with the Commission's overall program, and can be implemented  within budget, the Commission will take an active role in NEPA  procedures that are likely to result in significant mitigation  obligations for the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the Commission chooses not to implement a mitigation measure  or, for any reason be unable to implement a measure resulting from NEPA  procedures, the Commission will conduct, or cause to have conducted, a  supplemental environmental evaluation to determine suitable alternative  mitigation measures. The Commission will implement the findings of that  evaluation to the extent possible. The only exception will be when the  Commission proposes to substitute an equivalent mitigation measure that  meets with the approval of applicable Federal,   State, or Tribal fish and wildlife agencies, the Secretary of the  Interior, and other affected parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In order to assist agencies and other interested parties in  understanding the scope of the obligations contained in Title II,  Section 304, and Section 315, and others that may arise in the future,  the Commission will, at the time it invites recommendations on measures  to be included in the plan, prepare and distribute a list of projects  that the Commission considers to be obligations as defined in this  section.</p>
