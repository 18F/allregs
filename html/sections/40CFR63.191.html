Ethylidene norbornene is used in the production of ethylene-propylene rubber products.</p><p class="depth2">Hypalon \TM\ (chlorosulfonated polyethylene) means a synthetic rubber produced by reacting polyethylene with chloric and sulfur dioxide, transforming the thermoplastic polyethylene into a vulcanized elastomer. The reaction is conducted in a solvent (carbon tetrachloride) reaction medium.</p><p class="depth2">Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed source begins production. Initial start-up does not include operation solely for testing equipment. For purposes of subpart H of this part, initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups (as defined in Sec. 63.161 of subpart H of this part) of process units (as defined in Sec. 63.161 of subpart H of this part) following malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.</p><p class="depth2">In organic hazardous air pollutant service or in organic HAP service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of the designated organic HAP's listed in Sec. 63.190(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Methyl Methacrylate-Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (MABS) Resins means styrenic polymers containing methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, and styrene. The MABS copolymers are prepared by dissolving or dispersing polybutadiene rubber in a mixture of methyl methacrylate- acrylonitrile-styrene and butadiene monomer. The graft polymerization is carried out by a bulk or a suspension process.</p><p class="depth2">Methyl Methacrylate-Butadiene-Styrene (MBS) Resins means styrenic polymers containing methyl methacrylate, 1,3-butadiene, and styrene. Production of MBS terpolymers is achieved using an emulsion process in which methyl methacrylate and styrene are grafted onto a styrene- butadiene rubber.</p><p class="depth2">On-site or On site means, with respect to records required to be maintained by this subpart, that the records are stored at a location within a major source which encompasses the affected source.
