Appendix B to Subpart I of Part 1910-Nonmandatory Compliance</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment</p><p class="depth0">Selection</p><p class="depth0">This appendix is intended to provide compliance assistance for  employers and employees in implementing requirements for a hazard  assessment and the selection of personal protective equipment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Controlling hazards. PPE devices alone should not be relied on to  provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction  with guards, engineering controls, and sound manufacturing practices.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment and selection. It is necessary to consider certain  general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand  hazard situations that exist in an occupational or educational operation  or process, and to match the protective devices to the particular  hazard. It should be the responsibility of the safety officer to  exercise common sense and appropriate expertise to accomplish these  tasks.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assessment guidelines. In order to assess the need for PPE the  following steps should be taken:</p><p class="depth0">a. Survey. Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question.  The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards to workers  and co-workers. Consideration should be given to the basic hazard  categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Impact</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Penetration</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compression (roll-over)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Chemical</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Heat</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Harmful dust</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Light (optical) radiation</p><p class="depth0">b. Sources. During the walk-through survey the safety officer should  observe: (a) sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes where any  movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or  movement of personnel that could result in collision with stationary  objects; (b) sources of high temperatures that could result in burns,  eye injury or ignition of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of  chemical exposures; (d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light  radiation, i.e., welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating,  high intensity lights, etc.; (f) sources of falling objects or potential  for dropping objects; (g) sources of sharp objects which might pierce  the feet or cut the hands; (h) sources of rolling or pinching objects  which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace and location of co- workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accident  data should be reviewed to help identify problem areas.</p><p class="depth0">c. Organize data. Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary  to organize the data and information for use in the assessment of  hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in  the environment to enable proper selection of protective equipment.</p><p class="depth0">d. Analyze data. Having gathered and organized data on a workplace,  an estimate of the potential for injuries should be made. Each of the  basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and a determination  made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness of potential injury  from each of the hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure  to several hazards simultaneously should be considered.</p><p class="depth0">4. Selection guidelines. After completion of the procedures in  paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment  is to: a) Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of  protective equipment that is available, and what it can do; i.e., splash  protection, impact protection, etc.; b) compare the hazards associated  with the environment; i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape,  radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available protective  equipment; c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of  protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from  the hazards; and d) fit the user with the protective device and give  instructions on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that end  users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations of their  PPE.</p><p class="depth0">5. Fitting the device. Careful consideration must be given to  comfort and fit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary  protection. Continued wearing of the device is more likely if it fits  the wearer comfortably. Protective devices are generally available in a  variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure that the right size is  selected.</p><p class="depth0">6. Devices with adjustable features. Adjustments should be made on  an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the  protective device in the proper position. Particular care should be  taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical  splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face. In addition,  proper fitting of helmets is important to ensure that it will not fall  off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary  to keep the helmet on an employee's head. (Chin straps should break at a  reasonably low force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard).  Where manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed  carefully.</p><p class="depth0">7. Reassessment of hazards. It is the responsibility of the safety  officer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by  identifying and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing  accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously  selected PPE.</p><p class="depth0">8. Selection chart guidelines for eye and face protection. Some  occupations (not a complete list) for which eye protection should be  routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians, machinists,  mechanics and repairers, millwrights, plumbers and pipe fitters, sheet  metal workers and tinsmiths, assemblers, sanders, grinding machine  operators, lathe and milling machine operators, sawyers, welders,  laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, and timber cutting  and   logging workers.

See notes</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em>, (10). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Notes to Eye and Face Protection Selection Chart: (1) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and</p><p class="depth0">simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards. Adequate protection</p><p class="depth0">against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided.</p><p class="depth0">Protective devices do not provide unlimited protection. (2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As</p><p class="depth0">required by the standard, protection from both hazards must be</p><p class="depth0">provided. (3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection</p><p class="depth0">(spectacles or goggles). (4) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the</p><p class="depth0">requirements for shade designations in Sec. 1910.133(a)(5). Tinted</p><p class="depth0">and shaded lenses are not filter lenses unless they are marked or</p><p class="depth0">identified as such. (5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use</p><p class="depth0">of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either protective devices fitted</p><p class="depth0">with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be</p><p class="depth0">worn over regular prescription (Rx) eyewear. (6) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face</p><p class="depth0">protection devices in a hazardous environment. It should be recognized</p><p class="depth0">that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional</p><p class="depth0">hazard to contact lens wearers. (7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective</p><p class="depth0">devices in electrical hazard areas. (8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the</p><p class="depth0">protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing may be</p><p class="depth0">necessary. (9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primary eye</p><p class="depth0">protection (spectacles or goggles). (10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protection</p><p class="depth0">only, but are not acceptable eye protection for the sources and</p><p class="depth0">operations listed for ``impact.'' (11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash</p><p class="depth0">entry. Eye and face protection should be designed and used so that it</p><p class="depth0">provides both adequate ventilation and protects the wearer from splash</p><p class="depth0">entry. (12) Protection from light radiation is directly related to filter lens</p><p class="depth0">density. See note (4) . Select the darkest shade that allows task</p><p class="depth0">performance.</p><p class="depth0">9. Selection guidelines for head protection. All head protection  (helmets) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetration  hazards caused by falling objects. Head protection is also available  which provides protection from electric shock and burn. When selecting  head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important.  Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance,  provide electrical protection from low-voltage conductors (they are  proof tested to 2,200 volts). Class B helmets, in addition to impact and  penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from high-voltage  conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000 volts). Class C helmets  provide impact and penetration resistance (they are usually made of  aluminum which conducts electricity), and should not be used around  electrical hazards.</p><p class="depth0">Where falling object hazards are present, helmets must be worn. Some  examples include: working below other workers who are using tools and  materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which  are carrying parts or materials; working below machinery or processes  which   might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed  energized conductors.</p><p class="depth0">Some examples of occupations for which head protection should be  routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians, linemen, mechanics  and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers,  sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and  logging, stock handlers, and warehouse laborers.</p><p class="depth0">Beginning with the ANSI Z89.1-1997 standard, ANSI updated the  classification system for protective helmets. Prior revisions used type  classifications to distinguish between caps and full brimmed hats.  Beginning in 1997, Type I designated helmets designed to reduce the  force of impact resulting from a blow only to the top of the head, while  Type II designated helmets designed to reduce the force of impact  resulting from a blow to the top or sides of the head. Accordingly, if a  hazard assessment indicates that lateral impact to the head is  foreseeable, employers must select Type II helmets for their employees.  To improve comprehension and usefulness, the 1997 revision also  redesignated the electrical-protective classifications for helmets as  follows: ``Class G-General''; helmets designed to reduce the danger of  contact with low-voltage conductors; ``Class E-Electrical''; helmets  designed to reduce the danger of contact with conductors at higher  voltage levels; and ``Class C-Conductive''; helmets that provide no  protection against contact with electrical hazards.</p><p class="depth0">10. Selection guidelines for foot protection. Safety shoes and boots  which meet the ANSI Z41-1991 Standard provide both impact and  compression protection. Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained  which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal  protection should be provided, and in other special situations  electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes would be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for  carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy  tools, which could be dropped; and, for other activities where objects  might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression  protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks  (manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls)  and around heavy pipes, all of which could potentially roll over an  employee's feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be  required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large  staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a  foot injury. Electrically conductive shoes would be required as a  supplementary form of protection for work activities in which there is a  danger of fire or explosion from the discharge of static electricity.  Electrical-hazard or dielectric footwear would be required as a  supplementary form of protection when an employee standing on the ground  is exposed to hazardous step or touch potential (the difference in  electrical potential between the feet or between the hands and feet) or  when primary forms of electrical protective equipment, such as rubber  insulating gloves and blankets, do not provide complete protection for  an employee standing on the ground.</p><p class="depth0">Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection  should be routinely considered are: Shipping and receiving clerks, stock  clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers,  plumbers and pipe fitters, structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall  installers and lathers, packers, wrappers, craters, punch and stamping  press operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, gardeners  and grounds-keepers, timber cutting and logging workers, stock handlers  and warehouse laborers.</p><p class="depth0">11. Selection guidelines for hand protection. Gloves are often  relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with  chemicals that are capable of causing local or systemic effects  following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide  protection against all potential hand hazards, and commonly available  glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals.  Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a  particular application and to determine how long it can be worn, and  whether it can be reused.</p><p class="depth0">It is also important to know the performance characteristics of  gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated; e.g., chemical  hazards, cut hazards, flame hazards, etc. These performance  characteristics should be assessed by using standard test procedures.  Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from  the manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s)  for the hazard(s) anticipated.</p><p class="depth0">Other factors to be considered for glove selection in general  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in  certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective to regularly change  cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The work activities of the employee should be studied to  determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration, frequency, and  degree of exposure of the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be  applied.</p><p class="depth0">With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical  hazards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in  particular, the ability of the chemical to cause local effects on the  skin and /or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Generally, any ``chemical resistant'' glove can be used for dry  powders;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data  are available), a glove should be selected on the basis of the chemical  component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for  solvents to carry active ingredients through polymeric materials; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as  to prevent skin contamination.</p><p class="depth0">12. Cleaning and maintenance. It is important that all PPE be kept  clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for  eye and face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair  vision.</p><p class="depth0">For the purposes of compliance with Sec. 1910.132 (a) and (b), PPE  should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular intervals so  that the PPE provides the requisite protection.</p><p class="depth0">It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be  decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that protects employees from  exposure to hazards.
