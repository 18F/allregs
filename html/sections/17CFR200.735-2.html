In view of the effect which  Commission action frequently has on the general public, it is important  that members, employees and special Government employees maintain  unusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality and  conduct. They must be constantly aware of the need to avoid situations  which might result either in actual or apparent misconduct or conflicts  of interest and to conduct themselves in their official relationships in  a manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow  citizens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>, the applicable professional ethical standards.
