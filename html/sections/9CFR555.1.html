In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must
