Indirect effects may include growth inducing effects and  other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use,  population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water  and other natural systems, including ecosystems.  Effects and impacts as used in these regulations are synonymous. Effects  includes ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the  components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems),  aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether  direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those  resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental  effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be  beneficial.</p>
