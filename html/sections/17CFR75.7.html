                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under Sec. Sec. 75.4 through 75.6 if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of material conflict of interest. (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Timely and effective disclosure. (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information barriers. Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of high-risk asset and high-risk trading strategy. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> High-risk asset means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> High-risk trading strategy means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.
