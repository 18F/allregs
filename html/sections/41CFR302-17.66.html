                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To claim your RITA under the two-year process, you must submit a  voucher and attach the ``Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,'' as  discussed in Sec. Sec.  302-17.63-302-17.65.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your voucher must claim a specific amount. However, your agency  will calculate your actual RITA after you submit your RITA voucher and  your ``Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status;'' the amount you claim  on your voucher does not enter into that calculation. You should perform  the RITA calculation for yourself, as a check on your agency's  calculation, but you are not required to put the ``right answer'' on the  voucher you submit to claim your RITA.</p>
