The issuing officer shall ensure that any  notice issued under this section includes a copy of the summons and  provides the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That compliance with the summons may be stayed if written  direction not to comply with the summons is given by the person  receiving notice to the person summoned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That a copy of any such direction to not comply and a copy of  the summons shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the person  summoned and to the Customs officer who issued the summons; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the actions under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this  section shall be accomplished not later than the day before the day  fixed in the summons as the day upon which the records are to be  examined or the testimony is to be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service of notice. The Customs officer who issues the summons  shall serve the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section in the  same manner as is prescribed in Sec. 163.7(c)(2) for the service of a  summons, or by certified or registered mail to the last known address of  the person entitled to notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examination of records precluded.
