                                Sec. 20.2031-8  Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity contracts. (1) The value of a contract for the payment of an annuity, or an insurance policy on the life of a person other than the decedent, issued by a company regularly engaged in the selling of contracts of that character is established through the sale by that company of comparable contracts. An annuity payable under a combination annuity contract and life insurance policy on the decedent's life (e.g., a ``retirement income'' policy with death benefit) under which there was no insurance element at the time of the decedent's death (see paragraph (d) of Sec. 20.2039-1) is treated like a contract for the payment of an annuity for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The value of a contract for the payment of an annuity, or an insurance policy on the life of a person other than the decedent, issued by a company regularly engaged in the selling of contracts of that character is established through the sale by that company of comparable contracts.

If, however, because of the unusual nature of the contract such an approximation is not reasonably close to the full value of the contract, this method may not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each case involving an insurance contract, it is assumed that there are no accrued dividends or outstanding indebtedness on the contract.</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). X purchased from a life insurance company a joint and survivor annuity contract under the terms of which X was to receive payments of $1,200 annually for his life and, upon X's death, his wife was to receive payments of $1,200 annually for her life. Five years after such purchase, when his wife was 50 years of age, X died. The value of the annuity contract at the date of X's death is the amount which the company would charge for an annuity providing for the payment of $1,200 annually for the life of a female 50 years of age.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). Y died holding the incidents of ownership in a life insurance policy on the life of his wife. The policy was one on which no further payments were to be made to the company (e.g., a single premium policy or a paid-up policy). The value of the insurance policy at the date of Y's death is the amount which the company would charge for a single premium contract of the same specified amount on the life of a person of the age of the insured.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). Z died holding the incidents of ownership in a life insurance policy on the life of his wife. The policy was an ordinary life policy issued nine years and four months prior to Z's death and at a time when Z's wife was 35 years of age. The gross annual premium is $2,811 and the decedent died four months after the last premium due date. The value of the insurance policy at the date of Z's death is computed as follows:
Terminal reserve at end of tenth year.......................  $14,601.00Terminal reserve at end of ninth year.......................   12,965.00</p><p class="depth3">-----------</p><p class="depth3">Increase.................................................    1,636.00</p><p class="depth3">===========One-third of such increase (Z having died four months             545.33</p><p class="depth3">following the last preceding premium date) is..............Terminal reserve at end of ninth year.......................   12,965.00</p><p class="depth3">-----------Interpolated terminal reserve at date of Z's death..........   13,510.33Two-thirds of gross premium (\2/3\x$2,811)..................    1,874.00</p><p class="depth3">-----------</p><p class="depth3">Value of the insurance policy............................   15,384.33</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of shares in an open-end investment company. (1) The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a ``mutual fund'') is the public redemption price of a share. In the absence of an affirmative showing of the public redemption price in effect at the time of death, the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the date of death shall be presumed to be the applicable public redemption price. If the alternate valuation method under 2032 is elected, the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the alternate valuation date shall be the applicable redemption price. If there is no public redemption price quoted by the company for the applicable valuation

date (e.g., the valuation date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), the fair market value of the mutual fund share is the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the first day preceding the applicable valuation date for which there is a quotation. In any case where a dividend is declared on a share in an open-end investment company before the decedent's death but payable to shareholders of record on a date after his death and the share is quoted ``exdividend'' on the date of the decedent's death, the amount of the dividend is added to the ex-dividend quotation in determining the fair market value of the share as of the date of the decedent's death. As used in this paragraph, the term ``open-end investment company'' includes only a company which on the applicable valuation date was engaged in offering its shares to the public in the capacity of an open-end investment company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a ``mutual fund'') is the public redemption price of a share.
