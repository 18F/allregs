                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Rents and utility allowances for rental units in Agency-financed housing projects are set by the borrower and must be based on the operating, management and maintenance expenses and other costs related to the housing project including loan payment amounts due to the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency approval. All rents and utility allowances set by borrowers are subject to Agency approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rents. As applicable, borrowers must establish the following rents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Note rent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basic rent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) contract rents; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) rents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Utility allowances. In projects where tenants pay the utilities, borrowers must establish utility allowances for each size and type of rental unit in the housing project based on estimated utility costs. Borrowers must review utility allowances annually, adjust for accuracy, and submit any utility allowance changes to the Agency for approval. If no changes are needed, the borrower must notify the Agency that no changes were made. Documentation to justify utility allowances must be maintained in the housing project files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Funds contributed to reduce rents. If borrowers use funds contributed from sources other than the Agency (e.g., state or local grants, private contributions) to reduce general operating and management expenses, housing project rents must be reduced to reflect the funding being used to offset housing project expenses. When funds contributed from sources other than the Agency are used for housing project expenses, the borrower must certify to the Agency, in writing, that the funds provided will not need to be repaid with Agency funds. Funds from borrower contributions or rehabilitation loans will not be counted towards reducing rents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rents for resident manager, caretaker, or owner-occupied unit. (1) If approved as a part of a management plan, a borrower may occupy a rental unit in a housing project when they are acting as a management agent or resident manager as specified in Sec. 3560.102(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If approved as a part of a management plan, a borrower may occupy a rental unit in a housing project when they are acting as a management agent or resident manager as specified in Sec. 3560.102(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the rental unit being occupied by a borrower or resident manager is designated as a revenue-producing unit, borrowers must calculate the rental charge to the borrower or resident manager in the same manner as tenant contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the rental unit being occupied by a borrower or resident manager is designated as a non-revenue producing unit, borrowers must treat the cost of providing the unit the same as other non-revenue producing portions of the housing project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> LIHTC. Borrowers who receive LIHTCs may establish rents in accordance with LIHTC requirements. However, borrowers are obligated to ensure that sufficient annual funds are available to cover expenses in the housing project's approved budget, including the required payments on the borrower's Agency loan. Borrowers must not use housing project funds to make up any difference between rents required under Agency program requirements and the maximum allowed rents under the LIHTC program.</p>
