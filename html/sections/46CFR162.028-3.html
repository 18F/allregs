                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Every portable fire extinguisher shall conform to the requirements for listing and labeling by a recognized laboratory, and shall be of such design, materials, and construction as to meet the requirements specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Design and weight. Every portable fire extinguisher shall be self-contained, i.e., when charged it shall not require any additional source of extinguishing agent or expellant energy for its operation during the time it is being discharged, and it shall weigh not more than 55 pounds, maximum, when fully charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Materials. Materials used for exposed working parts shall be corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. Materials used for other exposed parts shall be either corrosion-resistant or shall be protected by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Corrosion-resistant materials. The materials which are considered to be corrosion-resistant are copper, brass, bronze, certain copper-nickel alloys, certain alloys of aluminum, certain plastics, and certain stainless steels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corrosion-resistant coatings. (i) The following systems of organic or metallic coatings for exposed non-working ferrous parts, when applied on properly prepared surfaces after all cutting, forming, and bending operations are completed, are considered to provide suitable corrosion resistance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Bonderizing, followed by the application of zinc chromate primer, followed by one or more applications of enamel; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hot-dipped or electrodeposited zinc in thicknesses not less than 0.002 inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Electrodeposited cadmium in thicknesses not less than 0.001 inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Hot-dipped or sprayed aluminum in thicknesses not less than 0.002 inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Copper plus nickel in total thicknesses not less than 0.003 inch, of which the nickel is not less than 0.002 inch, plus any thickness of chrome.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The metallic platings of less than the thicknesses specified in this paragraph are not acceptable for the protection against corrosion of ferrous parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decorative platings. Decorative platings in any thicknesses applied over corrosion-resistant materials and corrosion-resistant coatings are acceptable for either working or non-working parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dissimilar metals. The use of dissimilar metals in combination shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are necessary, provisions (such as bushings, gaskets, or o-rings) shall be employed to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, freezing or buckling of parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due to differences in thermal expansion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Suitability of materials. All extinguishers submitted for approval shall undergo the salt spray test in accordance with paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Salt spray tests. Expose the complete fully charged specimen extinguisher to a 20 percent sodium chloride solution spray at a temperature of 95 [deg]F. (35 [deg]C.) for a period of 240 hours. The procedures and apparatus described in Method 811 of Federal Test Method Standard No. 151 are suitable. Alternate methods may be found satisfactory if the results are comparable. Following the test, allow the specimen extinguisher to air dry for a period of 48 hours. Following the air drying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extinguisher must be capable of being operated and recharged in a normal fashion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any coating required in this section to be corrosion resistant must remain intact and must not be removable (when such removal exposes a material subject to corrosion) by such action as washing or rubbing with a thumb or fingernail;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No galvanic corrosion may appear at the points of contact or close proximity of dissimilar metals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The extinguisher and its bracket, if any, must not show any corrosion, except corrosion that can be easily wiped off after rinsing with tap water, on surfaces having no protective coating or paint; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The gauge on a stored pressure extinguisher must remain watertight throughout the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Bursting pressure. For all extinguishers except the carbon dioxide type, the hydrostatic bursting pressure of the extinguisher and component parts which are subjected to pressure, exclusive of the hose, shall be at least five times the maximum working pressure during discharge of the extinguisher at approximately 70 [deg]F. During this test, a pressure gauge if fitted will usually be removed to avoid breaking the indicating mechanism, but the gauge shall be capable of withstanding the same test without leaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vibration resistance. The complete, fully charged specimen extinguisher, secured in its bracket which is mounted to the test machine, shall be tested in accordance with sections 3.1 through 3.1.4.4 of Military Standard MIL-STD-167. Following this test, there shall be no obvious failures of parts or assemblies, and the specimen shall be capable of being operated satisfactorily without undue effort or special procedures on the part of the operator, and the specimen shall be capable of being recharged satisfactorily in accordance with the directions on the name plate without the use of extraordinary tools or procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional marking. (1) As part of the usual name plate marking, there shall be included the rated capacity of the extinguisher in gallons, quarts, or pounds, and complete instructions for recharging, including the identification of the recharge materials and of the pressure cartridge or separate container if one is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As part of the usual name plate marking, there shall be included the rated capacity of the extinguisher in gallons, quarts, or pounds, and complete instructions for recharging, including the identification of the recharge materials and of the pressure cartridge or separate container if one is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For extinguishers which are not ordinarily discharged or opened during the regular maintenance inspections and tests, the weight of the fully charged extinguisher shall be die-

stamped, embossed, or cast in a conspicuous location on the name plate, valve body, or shell of the extinguisher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pasted-on type paper or decalcomania labels are not acceptable for any of the required extinguisher markings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For stored pressure type or cartridge operated type water or antifreeze portable fire extinguishers, each extinguisher name plate shall be marked to indicate whether the extinguisher is to be filled with plain water or with anti-freeze solution. Combination type name plates showing the charge may be either plain water or antifreeze solution will not be permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recharge packages shall be legibly marked with the name of the recharge and the capacity of contents in gallons, quarts, or pounds, in addition to the usual recharge package marking. Recharge pressure cartridges shall, in addition to the usual marking, also be plainly marked to show the distinctive identifying designation of the cartridge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Mounting bracket. Every portable fire extinguisher shall be supplied with a suitable bracket which will hold the extinguisher securely in its stowage location on vessels or boats, and which is arranged to provide quick and positive release of the extinguisher for immediate use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Carbon dioxide type. Every carbon dioxide type extinguisher shall be fitted with a valve which will withstand a minimum bursting pressure of 6,000 p.s.i., and a discharge hose or tube which will withstand a minimum bursting pressure of 5,000 p.s.i. The hose shall be constructed with either a wire braid or other conducting material for conducting static charges occurring at the discharge nozzle back to the body of the extinguisher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Dry chemical type. (1) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every dry chemical stored pressure type portable fire extinguisher, i.e., one which employs a single chamber for both the dry chemical and expellant gas, shall be fitted with a pressure gauge or device to show visual indication of whether or not the pressure in the chamber is in the operating range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Toxic extinguishing agents. Every portable fire extinguisher shall contain only agents which qualify for the Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., toxicity rating of Group 5 or Group 6, and which in normal fire extinguishing use do not generate decomposition products in concentrations hazardous to life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Gauge. Every pressure gauge used on a portable fire extinguisher shall have an accuracy of at least 2 percent of the scale range for the middle half of the scale conforming to ASME Grade B commercial accuracy. The gauge when new shall be watertight, i.e., with the connection capped or plugged, no water shall penetrate to the interior of the case during submergence one foot below the surface of water for a period of two hours. The gauge shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant materials, so that the pointer or face lettering will not be obliterated by the action of salt water if some leakage should occur after rough handling or extended periods of service. The gauge, when attached to the fire extinguisher, shall pass the salt spray and vibration tests prescribed by Sec. 162.028-3 (c)(1) and (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Fire tests. In addition to the usual fire tests conducted to determine the suitability and adequacy of portable fire extinguishers, additional fire tests, such as those described in National Bureau of Standards Building Materials and Structures Report 150, issued June 14, 1957, may be employed in determining the suitability for ``marine type'' listing and labeling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Additional tests. Every portable extinguisher may be additionally examined and tested to establish its reliability and effectiveness in accordance with the intent of this specification for a ``marine type'' portable fire extinguisher when considered necessary by the Coast Guard or by the recognized laboratory.
