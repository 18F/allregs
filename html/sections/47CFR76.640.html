                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of this section shall apply to digital cable systems. For purposes of this section, digital cable systems shall be defined as a cable system with one or more channels utilizing QAM modulation for transporting programs and services from its headend to receiving devices. Cable systems that only pass through 8 VSB broadcast signals shall not be considered digital cable systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No later than July 1, 2004, cable operators shall support unidirectional digital cable products, as defined in Sec.  15.123 of this chapter, through the provisioning of Point of Deployment modules (PODs) and services, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Digital cable systems with an activated channel capacity of 750 MHz or greater shall comply with the following technical standards and requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> SCTE 40 2003 (formerly DVS 313): ``Digital Cable Network Interface Standard'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602), provided however that with respect to Table B.11, the Phase Noise requirement shall be -86 dB/Hz, and also provided that the ``transit delay for most distant customer'' requirement in Table B.3 is not mandatory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ANSI/SCTE 65 2002 (formerly DVS 234): ``Service Information Delivered Out-of-Band for Digital Cable Television'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602), provided however that the referenced Source Name Subtable shall be provided for Profiles 1, 2, and 3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ANSI/SCTE 54 2003 (formerly DVS 241): ``Digital Video Service Multiplex and Transport System Standard for Cable Television'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each digital transport stream that includes one or more services carried in-the-clear, such transport stream shall include virtual channel data in-band in the form of ATSC A/65B: ``ATSC Standard: Program and System Information Protocol for Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable (Revision B)'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602), when available from the content provider. With respect to in-band transport:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The data shall, at minimum, describe services carried within the transport stream carrying the PSIP data itself;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> PSIP data describing a twelve-hour time period shall be carried for each service in the transport stream. This twelve-hour period corresponds to delivery of the following event information tables: EIT-0, -1, -2 and -3;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The format of event information data format shall conform to ATSC A/65B: ``ATSC Standard: Program and System Information Protocol for Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable (Revision B)'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Each channel shall be identified by a one- or two-part channel number and a textual channel name; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The total bandwidth for PSIP data may be limited by the cable system to 80 kbps for a 27 Mbits multiplex and 115 kbps for a 38.8 Mbits multiplex.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When service information tables are transmitted out-of-band for scrambled services:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The data shall, at minimum, describe services carried within the transport stream carrying the PSIP data itself;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A virtual channel table shall be provided via the extended channel interface from the POD module. Tables to be included shall conform to ANSI/SCTE 65 2002 (formerly DVS 234): ``Service Information Delivered Out-of-

Band for Digital Cable Television'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Event information data when present shall conform to ANSI/SCTE 65 2002 (formerly DVS 234): ``Service Information Delivered Out-of-Band for Digital Cable Television'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602) (profiles 4 or higher).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Each channel shall be identified by a one-or two-part channel number and a textual channel name; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The channel number identified with out-of-band signaling information data should match the channel identified with in-band PSIP data for all unscrambled in-the-clear services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All digital cable systems shall comply with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> SCTE 28 2003 (formerly DVS 295): ``Host-POD Interface Standard'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SCTE 41 2003 (formerly DVS 301): ``POD Copy Protection System'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  76.602).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cable operators shall ensure, as to all digital cable systems, an adequate supply of PODs that comply with the standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to ensure convenient access to such PODS by customers. Without limiting the foregoing, cable operators may provide more advanced PODs (i.e., PODs that are based on successor standards to those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) to customers whose unidirectional digital cable products are compatible with the more advanced PODs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cable operators shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Effective April 1, 2004, upon request of a customer, replace any leased high definition set-top box, which does not include a functional IEEE 1394 interface, with one that includes a functional IEEE 1394 interface or upgrade the customer's set-top box by download or other means to ensure that the IEEE 1394 interface is functional.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective July 1, 2011, include both:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A DVI or HDMI interface and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A connection capable of delivering recordable high definition video and closed captioning data in an industry standard format on all high definition set-top boxes, except unidirectional set-top boxes without recording functionality, acquired by a cable operator for distribution to customers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effective December 1, 2012, ensure that the cable-operator-provided high definition set-top boxes, except unidirectional set-top boxes without recording functionality, shall comply with an open industry standard that provides for audiovisual communications including service discovery, video transport, and remote control command pass-through standards for home networking.
