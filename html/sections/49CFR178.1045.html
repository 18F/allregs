                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Container design types and performed periodically as specified in Sec. 178.1035(e) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special preparation for the drop test. Flexible Bulk Containers must be filled to their maximum permissible gross mass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test method. (1) A sample of all Flexible Bulk Container design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. This test surface must be large enough to be immovable during testing and sufficiently large enough to ensure that the test Flexible Bulk Container falls entirely upon the surface. The test surface must be kept free from local defects capable of influencing the test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sample of all Flexible Bulk Container design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface.

For all Flexible Bulk Container design types there may be no loss of the filling substance. However a slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the Flexible Bulk Container provided that no further leakage occurs after the container has been restored to the upright position.</p>
