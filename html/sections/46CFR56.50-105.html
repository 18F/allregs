                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class I-L. Piping systems designated to operate at temperatures  below 0 [deg]F. and pressures above 150 pounds per square inch gage  shall be of Class I-L. Exceptions to this rule may be found in the  individual requirements for specific commodities in subchapters D, I,  and O of this chapter. The following requirements for Class I-L piping  systems shall be satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Materials. All materials used in low temperature piping systems  shall be selected from among those specifications listed in Table 56.50- 105 and shall satisfy all of the requirements of the specifications,  except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum service temperature as defined in Sec. 54.25- 10(a)(2) of this subchapter shall not be colder than that shown in Table  56.50-105; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The material shall be tested for low temperature toughness  using the Charpy V-notch specimen of ASTM E 23 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 56.01-2), ``Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic  Materials'', Type A, Figure 4. The toughness testing requirements of  subpart 54.05 of this subchapter shall be satisfied for each particular  product form. Charpy V-notch tests shall be conducted at temperatures  not warmer than 10 [deg]F. below the minimum service temperature of the  design, except that for service temperatures of -320 [deg]F. and below,  the impact test may be conducted at the service temperature. The minimum  average energy shall not be less than that shown in Table 56.50-105. In  the case of steels conforming to the specifications of Table 54.25-20(a)  of this subchapter the minimum lateral expansion shall not be less than  that required in Sec. 54.25-20 of this subchapter.   The minimum energy permitted for a single specimen and the minimum  subsize energies shall be those obtained by multiplying the average  energy shown in Table 56.50-105 by the applicable fraction shown in  Table 56.50-105(a).</p><p class="depth4">Table 56.50-105(a)--Charpy V-Notch Energy Multiplying Factors ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Factor for   Factor for</p><p class="depth4">minimum      minimum</p><p class="depth4">energy,       energy</p><p class="depth4">Charpy V-notch specimen size \1\          average of     single</p><p class="depth4">3 specimens    specimen</p><p class="depth4">\1\          \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10 x 10 mm....................................            1          2/3 10 x 7.5 mm...................................          5/6          5/9 10 x 5.0 mm...................................          2/3          4/9 10 x 2.5 mm...................................          1/2         1/3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Straight line interpolation for intermediate values is permitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Steels equivalent to those listed in Table 56.50-105 of this  part, but not produced according to a particular ASTM specification, may  be used only with the prior consent of the Marine Safety Center. Steels  differing in chemical composition, mechanical properties or heat  treatments from those specified may be specially approved by the Marine  Safety Center. Similarly, aluminum alloys and other nonferrous materials  not covered in Table 56.50-105 of this part may be specifically approved  by the Marine Safety Center for service at any low temperature. There  are restrictions on the use of certain materials in this part and in  subchapter O of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Piping weldments. Piping weldments shall be fabricated to  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 57.03-1(b) of this subchapter in  addition to subpart 56.70. Toughness testing of production weldments for  low temperature piping systems and assemblies is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postweld heat treatment. All piping weldments shall be postweld  heat treated for stress relief in accordance with the procedures of  subpart 56.85. The only exceptions to this requirement are for materials  which do not require postweld heat treatment as shown in Table 56.85-10.  Relief from postweld heat treatment shall not be dependent upon pipe  thickness or weld joint type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nonacceptable joints. Single welded butt joints with backing  ring left in place, socket welds, slip-on flanges, pipe joining sleeves,  and threaded joints shall not be used, except in small diameter  instrument lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other requirements. All other requirements of this part for  Class I piping apply to Class I-L piping. Pressure testing must comply  with subpart 56.97 of this part, and nondestructive testing of  circumferentially welded joints must comply with Sec. 56.95-10.  Seamless tubular products must be used except that, when the service  pressure does not exceed 1724 KPa (250 psi), the Commanding Officer,  Marine Safety Center, may give special consideration to appropriate  grades of piping and tubing that are welded without the addition of  filler metal in the root pass. Each production procedure and quality- control program for welded products must be acceptable to the Officer in  Charge, Marine Inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class II-L. Piping systems designed to operate at temperatures  below 0 [deg]F. and pressures not higher than 150 pounds per square inch  gage shall be of Class II-L. Exceptions to this rule may be found in the  individual requirements for specific commodities in subchapter D (Tank  Vessels) and I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels) of this chapter. The  following requirements for Class II-L piping systems shall be satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  of this section except that pipe and tubing of appropriate grades welded  without the addition of a filler metal may be used. The Commandant may  give special consideration to tubular products welded with the addition  of filler metal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Piping weldments shall be fabricated to satisfy the requirements  of Sec. 57.03-1(b) of this subchapter in addition to subpart 56.70.  Toughness testing of production weldments for low temperature piping  systems and assemblies is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All piping weldments shall be postweld heat treated for stress  relief in accordance with the procedures of subpart 56.85. The only  exceptions to this requirement are for materials which do not require  postweld heat treatment as shown in Table 56.85-10 and for socket weld  joints and slip-on flange weld attachments where the   weld thickness does not exceed that exempted by this table. Otherwise,  relief from post-weld heat treatment shall not be dependent upon pipe  thickness or weld joint type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Socket welds in nominal sizes above 3 inches, slip-on flanges in  nominal sizes above 4 inches, and threaded joints in sizes above 1 inch  shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pressure testing must comply with subpart 56.97, and  nondestructive testing of welded joints must comply with Sec. 56.95-10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All other requirements contained in this part for Class II  piping shall be applicable to Class II-L systems, except that Sec.  56.70-15(b)(3)(iv) shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3">Table 56.50-105--Acceptable Materials and Toughness Test Criteria \2\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">ASTM specification                        Minimum service   Minimum avg Charpy</p><p class="depth3">Product form                    \3\              Grade \4\          temperature       V notch energy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pipe............................                      1.................  -30 [deg]F........  20 ft. lb.</p><p class="depth3">3.................  -150 [deg]F.......  25 ft. lb.
