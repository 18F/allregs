                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What is a VMS? A VMS consists of a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile  transceiver unit that automatically determines the vessel's position and  transmits it to a NMFS OLE type-approved communications service  provider. The communications service provider receives the transmission  and relays it to NMFS OLE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who is Required to Have a VMS? The following vessels are  required to install a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver unit and  to arrange for a NMFS OLE type-approved communications service provider  to receive and relay transmissions to NMFS OLE prior to fishing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any vessel registered for use with a limited entry ``A''  endorsed permit (i.e., not an MS permit) that fishes in state or Federal  waters seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is  measured off the States of Washington, Oregon or California (0-200 nm  offshore).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any vessel that uses non-groundfish trawl gear to fish in the  EEZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any vessel that uses open access gear to take and retain, or  possess groundfish in the EEZ or land groundfish taken in the EEZ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How are Mobile Transceiver Units and Communications Service  Providers Approved by NMFS OLE?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NMFS OLE will publish type-approval specifications for VMS  components in the Federal Register or notify the public through other  appropriate media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mobile transceiver unit manufacturers or communication service  providers will submit products or services to NMFS OLE for evaluation  based on the published specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NMFS OLE may publish a list of NMFS OLE type-approved mobile  transceiver units and communication service providers for the Pacific  Coast groundfish fishery in the Federal Register or notify the public  through other appropriate media. As necessary, NMFS OLE may publish  amendments to the list of type-approved mobile transceiver units and  communication service providers in the Federal Register or through other  appropriate media. A list of VMS transceivers that have been type- approved by NMFS OLE may be mailed to the permit owner's address of  record. NMFS will bear no responsibility if a notification is sent to  the address of record and is not received because the applicant's actual  address has changed without notification to NMFS, as required at Sec.  660.25(b)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What are the Vessel Owner's Responsibilities? If you are a  vessel owner that must participate in the VMS program, you or the vessel  operator must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a NMFS OLE type-approved mobile transceiver unit and have  it installed on board your vessel in accordance with the instructions  provided by NMFS OLE. You may obtain a copy of the VMS installation and  operation instructions from the NMFS OLE Northwest, VMS Program Manager  upon request at 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone:  (206) 526-6133.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activate the mobile transceiver unit, submit an activation  report at least 72 hours prior to leaving port on a trip in which VMS is  required, and receive confirmation from NMFS OLE that the VMS  transmissions are being received before participating in a fishery  requiring the VMS. Instructions for submitting an activation report may  be obtained from the NMFS, Northwest OLE VMS Program Manager upon  request at 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone: (206)  526-6133. An activation report must again be submitted to NMFS OLE  following reinstallation of a mobile transceiver unit or change in  service provider before the vessel may be used to fish in a fishery  requiring the VMS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Activation reports. If you are a vessel owner who must use VMS  and you are activating a VMS transceiver unit for the first time or  reactivating a VMS transceiver unit following a reinstallation of a  mobile transceiver unit or change in service provider, you must fax NMFS  OLE an activation report that includes: Vessel name; vessel owner's  name, address and telephone number, vessel operator's name, address and  telephone number, USCG vessel documentation number/state registration  number; if applicable, the groundfish permit number the vessel is  registered to; VMS transceiver unit manufacturer; VMS communications  service provider; VMS transceiver identification; identifying if the  unit is the primary or backup; and a statement signed and dated by the  vessel owner confirming compliance with the installation procedures  provided by NMFS OLE.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transferring ownership of VMS unit. Ownership of the VMS  transceiver unit may be transferred from one vessel owner to another  vessel owner if all of the following documents are provided to NMFS OLE:  A new activation report, which identifies that the transceiver unit was  previously registered to another vessel; a notarized bill of sale  showing proof of ownership of the VMS transceiver unit; documentation  from the communications service provider showing proof that the service  agreement for the previous vessel was terminated and that a service  agreement was established for the new vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transceiver unit operation. Operate and maintain the mobile  transceiver unit in good working order continuously, 24 hours a day  throughout the fishing year, unless such vessel is exempted under  paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The mobile transceiver unit must  transmit a signal accurately indicating the vessel's position at least  once every hour, 24 hours a day,   throughout the year unless a valid exemption report, as described in  paragraph (b)(4) of this section, has been received by NMFS OLE. Less  frequent position reporting at least once every four hours is authorized  when a vessel remains in port for an extended period of time, but the  mobile transceiver unit must remain in continuous operation at all times  unless the vessel is exempted under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(vii)</em> of this  section, is received by NMFS OLE and the vessel is in compliance with  all conditions and requirements of the VMS exemption identified in this  section and specified in the exemption report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Haul out exemption. When it is anticipated that a vessel will be  continuously out of the water for more than 7 consecutive days and a  valid exemption report has been received by NMFS OLE, electrical power  to the VMS mobile transceiver unit may be removed and transmissions may  be discontinued. Under this exemption, VMS transmissions can be  discontinued from the time the vessel is removed from the water until  the time that the vessel is placed back in the water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outside areas exemption. When the vessel will be operating  seaward of the EEZ off Washington, Oregon, or California continuously  for more than 7 consecutive days and a valid exemption report has been  received by NMFS OLE, the VMS mobile transceiver unit transmissions may  be reduced or discontinued from the time the vessel leaves the EEZ off  the coasts of Washington, Oregon or California until the time that the  vessel re-enters the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon or  California. Under this exemption, the vessel owner or operator can  request that NMFS OLE reduce or discontinue the VMS transmissions after  receipt of an exemption report, if the vessel is equipped with a VMS  transceiver unit that NMFS OLE has approved for this exemption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Permit exemption. If the limited entry permit had a change in  vessel registration so that it is no longer registered to the vessel  (for the purposes of this section, this includes permits placed into  ``unidentified'' status), the vessel may be exempted from VMS  requirements providing the vessel is not used to fish in state or  Federal waters seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is  measured off the States of Washington, Oregon or California (0-200 nm  offshore) for the remainder of the fishing year. If the vessel is used  to fish in this area for any species of fish at any time during the  remaining portion of the fishing year without being registered to a  limited entry permit, the vessel is required to have and use VMS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Long-term departure exemption. A vessel participating in the  open access fishery that is required to have VMS under paragraph (b)(3)  of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions after the end of the  fishing year in which it fished in the open access fishery, providing  the vessel submits a completed exemption report signed by the vessel  owner that includes a statement signed by the vessel owner indicating  that the vessel will not be used to take and retain or possess  groundfish in the EEZ or land groundfish taken in the EEZ during the new  fishing year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Emergency exemption. Vessels required to have VMS under  paragraph (b) of this section may be exempted from VMS provisions in  emergency situations that are beyond the vessel owner's control,  including but not limited to: Fire, flooding, or extensive physical  damage to critical areas of the vessel. A vessel owner may apply for an  emergency exemption from the VMS requirements specified in paragraph (b)  of this section for his/her vessel by sending a written request to NMFS  OLE specifying the following information: The reasons for seeking an  exemption, including any supporting documents (e.g., repair invoices,  photographs showing damage to the vessel, insurance claim forms, etc.);  the time period for which the exemption is requested; and the location  of the vessel while the exemption is in effect. NMFS OLE will issue a  written determination   granting or denying the emergency exemption request. A vessel will not  be covered by the emergency exemption until NMFS OLE issues a  determination granting the exemption. If an exemption is granted, the  duration of the exemption will be specified in the NMFS OLE  determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Submission of exemption reports. Signed long-term departure  exemption reports must be submitted by fax or by emailing an electronic  copy of the actual report. In the event of an emergency in which an  emergency exemption request will be submitted, initial contact with NMFS  OLE must be made by telephone, fax or email within 24 hours from when  the incident occurred. Emergency exemption requests must be requested in  writing within 72 hours from when the incident occurred. Other exemption  reports must be submitted through the VMS or another method that is  approved by NMFS OLE and announced in the Federal Register. Submission  methods for exemption requests, except long-term departures and  emergency exemption requests, may include email, facsimile, or  telephone. NMFS OLE will provide, through appropriate media,  instructions to the public on submitting exemption reports. Instructions  and other information needed to make exemption reports may be mailed to  the vessel owner's address of record. NMFS will bear no responsibility  if a notification is sent to the address of record for the vessel owner  and is not received because the vessel owner's actual address has  changed without notification to NMFS. Owners of vessels required to use  VMS who do not receive instructions by mail are responsible for  contacting NMFS OLE during business hours at least 3 days before the  exemption is required to obtain information needed to make exemption  reports. NMFS OLE must be contacted during business hours (Monday  through Friday between 0800 and 1700 Pacific Time).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Valid exemption reports. For an exemption report to be valid,  it must be received by NMFS at least 2 hours and not more than 24 hours  before the exempted activities defined at paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through  (iv) of this section occur. An exemption report is valid until NMFS  receives a report canceling the exemption. An exemption cancellation  must be received at least 2 hours before the vessel re-enters the EEZ  following an outside areas exemption; at least 2 hours before the vessel  is placed back in the water following a haul out exemption; at least 2  hours before the vessel resumes fishing for any species of fish in state  or Federal waters off the States of Washington, Oregon, or California  after it has received a permit exemption; or at least 2 hours before a  vessel resumes fishing in the open access fishery after a long-term  departure exemption. If a vessel is required to submit an activation  report under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section before returning to  fish, that report may substitute for the exemption cancellation. Initial  contact must be made with NMFS OLE not more than 24 hours after the time  that an emergency situation occurred in which VMS transmissions were  disrupted and followed by a written emergency exemption request within  72 hours from when the incident occurred. If the emergency situation  upon which an emergency exemption is based is resolved before the  exemption expires, an exemption cancellation must be received by NMFS at  least 2 hours before the vessel resumes fishing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When aware that transmission of automatic position reports has  been interrupted, or when notified by NMFS OLE that automatic position  reports are not being received, contact NMFS OLE at 7600 Sand Point Way  NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, phone: (206) 526-6133 and follow the  instructions provided to you. Such instructions may include, but are not  limited to, manually communicating to a location designated by NMFS OLE  the vessel's position or returning to port until the VMS is operable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After a fishing trip during which interruption of automatic  position reports has occurred, the vessel's owner or operator must  replace or repair the mobile transceiver unit prior to the vessel's next  fishing trip. Repair or reinstallation of a mobile transceiver unit or  installation of a replacement, including change of communications  service provider shall be in accordance with the instructions provided  by   NMFS OLE and require the same certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Make the mobile transceiver units available for inspection by  NMFS OLE personnel, USCG personnel, state enforcement personnel or any  authorized officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Ensure that the mobile transceiver unit is not tampered with,  disabled, destroyed, operated, or maintained improperly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Pay all charges levied by the communication service provider as  necessary to ensure continuous operation of the VMS transceiver units.  [75 FR 60897, Oct. 1, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 78374, Dec. 15, 2010; 76  FR 74733, Dec. 1, 2011]</p>
