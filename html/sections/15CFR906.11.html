                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An appellate officer in his or her discretion  may order a hearing taking into account the information provided by an  appellant pursuant to Sec. 906.3(b)(3) and whether an appellate officer  considers that a hearing will materially advance his or her evaluation  of the issues under appeal. In exercising his or her discretion, an  appellate officer may consider whether oral testimony is required to  resolve a material issue of fact, whether oral presentation is needed to  probe a party's position on a material issue of law, and whether a  hearing was held previously for the same appeal. If an appellate officer  determines that a hearing is not necessary, then the appellate officer  will base his or her decision on the NAO case record. In the absence of  a hearing an appellate officer may, at his or her discretion, permit the  parties to submit additional materials for consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an appellate officer convenes a hearing, the hearing will be  conducted in the manner determined by NAO most likely to obtain the  facts relevant to the matter or matters at issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NAO shall schedule the date, time and place for the hearing. NAO  will notify the parties in writing of the hearing date, time and place  at least 10 days prior to the hearing unless the Chief of NAO orders a  shorter period for providing notice or conducting the hearing. A party  can request one change in the scheduled hearing date. In determining  whether to grant the request, NAO will consider whether the requesting  party has shown good cause for the change in date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the hearing, all testimony will be under oath or affirmation  administered by an appellate officer. In the event a party or a witness  refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer a question, an appellate  officer may state for the record any inference drawn from such refusal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An appellate officer may question the parties and the witnesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An appellate officer will allow time for parties to present  argument, question witnesses and other parties, and introduce evidence  consistent with Sec. 906.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Parties may not compel discovery or the testimony of any  witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recording. An appellate officer will record the hearing unless  the appellant consents to proceed without a recording.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Format. At the discretion of NAO, hearings may be conducted by  telephone, in person, or by teleconference or similar electronic means.</p>
