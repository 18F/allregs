The notification shall identify any covered item(s) and shall provide the pertinent USML reference(s) from 22 CFR Part 121.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The USML includes defense articles and defense services that fall into 21 categories. Since not all USML items are themselves munitions (e.g., protective personnel equipment, military training equipment), the requiring activity should consult the USML before concluding that an item is or is not covered by the USML.
