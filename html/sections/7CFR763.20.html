                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prompt payment guarantee plan. If the buyer fails to pay an annual amortized installment or a portion of an installment on the contract or taxes or insurance when due, the escrow agent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, taxes, or insurance and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must make demand on the Agency within 90 days from the original payment, taxes, or insurance due date, for the missed payment in the event the buyer has not made the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard guarantee plan. If the buyer fails to pay an annual amortized installment or a portion of an installment on the contract, then the seller has the option of either liquidating the real estate, or having the amount of the loss established by the Agency by an appraisal of the real estate. For either option, the servicing agent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must immediately inform the Agency which option the seller has chosen for establishing the amount of the loss, in the event the buyer does not make the payment within 60 days of the demand letter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Liquidation method. If the seller chooses the liquidation method, the servicing agent will:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Submit a liquidation plan to the Agency within 120 days from the missed payment for approval prior to any liquidation action. The Agency may require and pay for an appraisal prior to approval of the liquidation plan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Complete liquidation within 12 months of the missed installment unless prevented by bankruptcy, redemption rights, or other legal action.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Credit an amount equal to the sale price received in a liquidation of the security property, with no deduction for expenses, to the principal balance of the land contract.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> File a loss claim immediately after liquidation, which must include a complete loan ledger.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Base the loss claim amount on the appraisal method if the property is reacquired by the seller, through liquidation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appraisal method. If the seller chooses to have the loss amount established by appraisal rather than liquidation, the Agency will complete an appraisal on the real estate, and the loss claim amount will be based on the difference between the appraised value at the time the loss is calculated and the unpaid principal balance of the land contract at that time.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The only administrative appeal allowed under Sec.  761.6 of this chapter related to the resulting appraisal amount will be a determination of whether the appraisal is Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) compliant.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The seller will give the Agency a lien on the security property in the amount of the loss claim payment. If the property sells within 5 years from the date of the loss payment for an amount greater than the appraised value used to establish the loss claim amount, the seller must repay the difference, up to the amount of the loss claim. For purposes of determining the amount to be repaid (recapture), the market value of the property may be reduced by the value of certain capital improvements, as specified in Sec.  766.202(a)(1)-(3) of this chapter, made by the seller to the property in the time period from the loss claim to final disposition. If the property is not sold within 5 years from the date of the loss payment, the Agency will release the lien and the seller will have no further obligation to the Agency.</p>
