In addition, a public hearing may be  held when it is proposed to modify or revoke a permit. (See 33 CFR  325.7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the public notice specifies that a public hearing will be  held, any person may request, in writing, within the comment period  specified in the public notice on a DA permit application or on a  Federal project, that a public hearing be held to consider the material  matters at issue in the permit application or with respect to Federal  project. Upon receipt of any such request, stating with particularity  the reasons for holding a public hearing, the district engineer may  expeditiously attempt to resolve the issues informally. Otherwise, he  shall promptly set a time and place for the public hearing, and give due  notice thereof, as prescribed in Sec. 327.11 of this part. Requests for  a public hearing under this paragraph shall be granted, unless the  district engineer determines that the issues raised are insubstantial or  there is otherwise no valid interest to be served by a hearing. The  district engineer will make such a determination in writing, and  communicate his reasons therefor to all requesting parties. Comments  received as form letters or petitions may be acknowledged as a group to  the person or organization responsible for the form letter or petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In case of doubt, a public hearing shall be held. HQDA has the  discretionary power to require hearings in any case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In fixing the time and place for a hearing, the convenience and  necessity of the interested public will be duly considered.</p>
