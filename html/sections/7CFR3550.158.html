                            <p class="depth0">The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act requires that the interest rate  charged a borrower who enters full-time active military duty after a  loan is closed not exceed six percent. Active military duty does not  include participation in a military reserve or the National Guard unless  the borrower is called to active duty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount of assistance. If a borrower qualifies for payment  subsidy after reduction of the interest rate to six percent, the amount  of payment subsidy received during the period of active military duty  will be the difference between the amount due at the subsidized rate for  principal and interest and the amount due at a six percent interest  rate. The six percent interest rate will be effective with the first  payment due after RHS confirms the active military status of the  borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of active military status. The borrower must notify RHS  when he or she is no longer on active military duty. RHS will cancel the  six percent interest rate and resume use of the   promissory note interest rate. A new payment subsidy agreement may be  processed if the borrower is eligible.</p>
