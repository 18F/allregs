                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rate-of-return carrier recipients of high-cost support are required to offer broadband service at actual speeds of at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream, with latency suitable for real-time applications, including Voice over Internet Protocol, and usage capacity that is reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in urban areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates for comparable offerings in urban areas, upon reasonable request. If a request for broadband service at actual speeds of at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream is unreasonable, and offering broadband service at actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream is reasonable, rate-of-return recipients of high-cost support are required to offer broadband service at actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream. For purposes

of determining reasonable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed to meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below the applicable benchmark to be announced annually by public notice issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau, or no more than the non-promotional prices charged for a comparable fixed wireline service in urban areas in the state or U.S. Territory where the eligible telecommunications carrier receives support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rate-of-return carrier recipients of high-cost support are required upon reasonable request to bid on category one telecommunications and Internet access services in response to a posted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that meets the connectivity targets for the schools and libraries universal service support program for eligible schools and libraries (as described in Sec. 54.501) within that carrier's service area. Such bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to rates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban areas for comparable offerings.
