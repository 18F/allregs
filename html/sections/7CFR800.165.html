                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The accuracy of the statements and information shown on  official certificates shall be verified by the individual whose name or  signature is shown on the certificate, or by the authorized agent who  affixed the name or signature. Errors found during this process shall be  corrected according to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who may correct. Only official personnel or their authorized  agents may make corrections, erasures, additions, or other changes to  official certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrections prior to issuance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Export certificates. No  corrections, erasures, additions, or other changes can be made to an  export certificate. If any error is found prior to issuance, a new  certificate shall be prepared and issued and the incorrect certificate  marked ``Void.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other than export certificates. No corrections, erasures,  additions, or other changes shall be made to other than export  certificates which involve identification, grade, gross, tare, or net  weight. If errors are found, a new certificate shall be prepared and  issued and the incorrect certificate marked ``Void.'' Otherwise, errors  may be corrected provided that (i) the corrections are neat and legible,  (ii) each correction is initialed by the individual who corrects the  certificate, and (iii) the corrections and initials are shown on the  original and all copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Corrections after issuance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If errors are found on  a certificate at any time up to a maximum of 1 year after issuance, the  errors shall be corrected by obtaining the incorrect certificate and  replacing it with a corrected certificate. When the incorrect  certificate cannot be obtained, a corrected certificate can be issued  superseding the incorrect one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification requirements. The same statements and information,  including permissive statements, that were shown on the incorrect  certificate, along with the correct statement or information, shall be  shown on the corrected certificate. According to this section and the  instructions, corrected certificates shall show (i) the terms  ``Corrected-Original'' and ``Corrected-Copy;'' (ii) a statement  identifying the superseded certificate and the corrections; (iii) a  statement indicating the superseded certificate was not surrended if the  incorrect certificate was not surrendered; and (iv) a new serial number.  In addition, the incorrect certificate shall be marked ``Void'' when  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitations. Corrected certificates cannot be issued for a  certificate that has been superseded by another certificate or on the  basis of a subsequent analysis for quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of superseded certificate prohibited. As of the date of  issuance of the corrected certificate, the superseded certificate will  be void and shall not be used to represent the grain.
