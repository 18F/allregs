                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Number and location. Emergency exits must be located to allow  escape without crowding in any probable crash attitude. The airplane  must have at least the following emergency exits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For all airplanes with a seating capacity of two or more,  excluding airplanes with canopies, at least one emergency exit on the  opposite side of the cabin from the main door specified in Sec. 23.783  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the pilot compartment is separated from the cabin by a door  that is likely to block the pilot's escape in a minor crash, there must  be an exit in the pilot's compartment. The number of exits required by  paragraph (a)(1) of this section must then be separately determined for  the passenger compartment, using the seating capacity of that  compartment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Emergency exits must not be located with respect to any  propeller disk or any other potential hazard so as to endanger persons  using that exit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type and operation. Emergency exits must be movable windows,  panels, canopies, or external doors, openable from both inside and  outside the airplane, that provide a clear and unobstructed opening  large enough to admit a 19-by-26-inch ellipse. Auxiliary locking devices  used to secure the airplane must be designed to be overridden by the  normal internal opening means. The inside handles of emergency exits  that open outward must be adequately protected against inadvertent  operation. In addition, each emergency exit must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be readily accessible, requiring no exceptional agility to be  used in emergencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have a method of opening that is simple and obvious;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be arranged and marked for easy location and operation, even in  darkness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have reasonable provisions against jamming by fuselage  deformation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of acrobatic category airplanes, allow each occupant  to abandon the airplane at any speed between VSO and  VD; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of utility category airplanes certificated for  spinning, allow each occupant to abandon the airplane at the highest  speed likely to be achieved in the maneuver for which the airplane is  certificated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tests. The proper functioning of each emergency exit must be  shown by tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Doors and exits. In addition, for commuter category airplanes,  the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the passenger entry door--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an airplane with a total passenger seating capacity of 15 or  fewer, an emergency exit, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section,  is required on each side of the cabin; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an airplane with a total passenger seating capacity of 16  through 19, three emergency exits, as defined in paragraph (b) of this  section, are required with one on the same side as the passenger entry  door and two on the side opposite the door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A means must be provided to lock each emergency exit and to  safeguard against its opening in flight, either inadvertently by persons  or as a result of mechanical failure. In addition, a means for direct  visual inspection of the locking mechanism must be provided to determine  that each emergency exit for which the initial opening movement is  outward is fully locked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each required emergency exit, except floor level exits, must be  located over the wing or, if not less than six feet from the ground,  must be provided with an acceptable means to assist the occupants to  descend to the ground. Emergency exits must be distributed as uniformly  as practical, taking into account passenger seating configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless the applicant has complied with paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, there must be an emergency exit on the side of the cabin  opposite the passenger entry door, provided that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an airplane having a passenger seating configuration of nine  or fewer, the emergency exit has a rectangular opening measuring not  less than 19 inches by 26 inches high with corner radii not greater than  one-third the width of the exit, located over the wing, with a step up  inside the airplane of not more than 29 inches and a step down outside  the airplane of not more than 36 inches;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an airplane having a passenger seating configuration of 10  to 19 passengers, the emergency exit has a rectangular opening measuring  not less than 20 inches wide by 36 inches high, with corner radii not  greater than one-third the width of the exit, and with a step up inside  the airplane of not more than 20 inches. If the exit is located over the  wing, the step down outside the airplane may not exceed 27 inches; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The airplane complies with the additional requirements of  Sec. Sec. 23.561(b)(2)(iv), 23.803(b), 23.811(c), 23.812, 23.813(b),  and 23.815.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For multiengine airplanes, ditching emergency exits must be  provided in accordance with the following requirements, unless the  emergency exits required by paragraph (a) or (d) of this section already  comply with them:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One exit above the waterline on each side of the airplane having  the dimensions specified in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, as  applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If side exits cannot be above the waterline, there must be a  readily accessible overhead hatch emergency exit that has a rectangular  opening measuring not less than 20 inches wide by 36 inches long, with  corner radii not greater than one-third the width of the exit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In lieu of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, if any side exit(s)  cannot be above the waterline, a device may be placed at each of such  exit(s) prior to ditching. This device must slow the inflow of water  when such exit(s) is opened with the airplane ditched. For commuter  category airplanes, the clear opening of such exit(s) must meet the  requirements defined in paragraph (d) of this section.  [Doc.
