                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each antenna farm area will be established by an appropriate  rulemaking proceeding, which may be commenced by the Commission on its  own motion after consultation with the FAA, upon request of the FAA, or  as a result of a petition filed by any interested person. After receipt  of a petition from an interested person disclosing sufficient reasons to  justify institution of a rulemaking proceeding, the Commission will  request the advice of the FAA with respect to the considerations of  menace to air navigation in terms of air safety which may be presented  by the proposal. The written communication received from the FAA in  response to the Commission's request shall be placed in the Commission's  public rulemaking file containing the petition, and interested persons  shall be allowed a period of 30 days within which to file statements  with respect thereto. Such statements shall also be filed with the  Administrator of the FAA with proof of such filing to be established in  accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this chapter. The Administrator of the FAA  shall have a period of 15 days within which to file responses to such  statements. If the Commission, upon consideration of the matters  presented to it in accordance with the above procedure, is satisfied  that establishment of the proposed antenna farm would constitute a  menace to air navigation for reasons of air safety, rulemaking  proceedings will not be instituted. If rulemaking proceedings are  instituted, any person filing comments therein which concern the  question of whether the proposed antenna farm will constitute a menace  to air navigation shall file a copy of the comments with the  Administrator of the FAA. Proof of such filing shall be established in  accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to mean that only one  antenna farm area will be designated for a community. The Commission  will consider on a case-by-case basis whether or not more than one  antenna farm area shall be designated for a particular community.  [32 FR 8813, June 21, 1967, as amended at 32 FR 13591, Sept. 28, 1967]</p>
