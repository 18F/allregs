                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a completed sustainable use management plan for a  country of export, the Director may approve a species listed in  Appendices II or III of the Convention for importation from that  country. Such approval shall be granted in accordance with the issuance  criteria of this section. All approved species and countries of export  will be listed in section 15.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for scientifically-based sustainable use management  plans. Sustainable use management plans developed by the country of  export should be submitted for species which breed in the country of  export. If the species does not breed in the country of export, the  Service will consider sustainable use management plans only when the  plan is scientifically valid and nesting (breeding) information can be  provided from countries in which the species breeds.

Upon receiving a sustainable use management  plan in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will  decide whether or not an exotic bird species should be listed as an  approved species for importation from the country of export, under  section 15.33. In making this decision, the Director shall consider in  addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, all of  the following factors for the species:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the country of export is effectively implementing the  Convention, particularly with respect to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establishment of a functioning Scientific Authority;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of Article IV of the Convention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention  with respect to this and similar species, including recommendations of  permanent committees of the Convention; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Article VIII of the Convention, including but not limited to  establishment of legislation and infrastructure necessary to enforce the  Convention, and submission of annual reports to the Convention's  Secretariat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the country of export has developed a scientifically- based management plan for the species that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides for the conservation of the species and its habitat(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Includes incentives for conservation unless the species is a  documented pest species;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is adequately implemented and enforced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ensures that the use of the species is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Sustainable;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Maintained throughout its range at a level that is consistent  with the species' role in its ecosystem; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is well above the level at which the species might become  threatened;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Addresses illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use,  disease, and habitat loss; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Ensures that the methods of capture, transport, and maintenance  of the species minimize the risk of injury, damage to health, and  inhumane treatment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the species has a multi-national distribution:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether populations of the species in other countries in which  it occurs will not be detrimentally affected by exports of the species  from the country requesting approval;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether factors affecting conservation of the species,  including export from other countries, illegal trade, domestic use, or  subsistence use are regulated throughout the range of the species so  that recruitment and/or breeding stocks of the species will not be  detrimentally affected by the proposed export;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the projected take and export will not detrimentally  affect breeding populations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the projected take and export will not detrimentally  affect existing enhancement activities, conservation programs, or  enforcement efforts throughout the species' range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of applying the criterion in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)  of this section, the Director may give positive consideration to plans  wherein very conservative capture and export quotas are implemented  prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information  necessary for a more large-scale management plan, if the country can  demonstrate that such conservative capture and export quotas are non- detrimental to the species survival in the wild under the criterion in  paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Publication in the Federal Register. The Director shall publish  notice in the Federal Register of the availability of each complete  sustainable use management plan received under paragraph (a) of this  section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested parties  of written data, views, or arguments with respect to the proposed  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration of approval. A species and country of export listed in  section 15.33 as approved shall be approved for 3 years, at which time  renewal of approval shall be considered by the Service.
