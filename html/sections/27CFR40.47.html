Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer of tobacco products may not engage in such other business until the application is approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer must retain as part of its records any authorization provided under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Processed tobacco.
