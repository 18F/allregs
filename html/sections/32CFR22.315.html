                            <p class="depth0">Competitive procedures are methods that encourage participation in  DoD programs by a broad base of the most highly qualified performers.  These procedures are characterized by competition among as many eligible  proposers as possible, with a published or widely disseminated notice.  Competitive procedures include, as a minimum:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice to prospective proposers. The notice may be a notice of  funding availability or Broad Agency Announcement that is publicly  disseminated, with unlimited distribution, or a specific notice that is  distributed to eligible proposers (a specific notice must be distributed  to at least two eligible proposers to be considered as part of a  competitive procedure). Requirements for notices are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The format and content of each notice must conform with the  Governmentwide format for announcements of funding opportunities  established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in a policy  directive entitled, ``Format for Financial Assistance Program  Announcements.'' \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ This OMB policy directive is available at the Internet site  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/grants_docs.html (the link is  ``Final Policy Directive on Financial Assistance Program  Announcements''). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with that OMB policy directive, DoD Components  also must post on the Internet any notice under which domestic entities  may submit proposals, if the distribution of the notice is unlimited.  DoD Components are encouraged to simultaneously publish the notice in  other media (e.g., the Federal Register), if doing so would increase the  likelihood of its being seen by potential proposers. If a DoD Component  issues a specific notice with limited distribution (e.g., for national  security considerations), the notice need not be posted on the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To comply with an OMB policy directive entitled, ``Requirement  to Post Funding Opportunity Announcement Synopses at Grants.gov and  Related Data Elements/Format,'' \3\ DoD Components must post on the  Internet a synopsis for each notice that, in accordance with paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, is posted on the Internet. The synopsis must be  posted at the Governmentwide site designated by the OMB (currently  http://www.FedGrants.gov). The synopsis for each notice must provide  complete instructions on where to obtain the notice and should have an  electronic link to the Internet location at which the notice is posted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\3\ This OMB policy directive is available at the Internet site  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/grants_docs.html (the link is  ``Office of Federal Financial Management Policy Directive on Use of  Grants.Gov FIND''). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In accordance with an OMB policy directive entitled,  ``Requirement for a DUNS Number in Applications for Federal Grants and  Cooperative Agreements,'' \4\ each notice must include a requirement for  proposers to include Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers in  their proposals. If a notice provides for submission of application  forms, the forms must incorporate the DUNS number. To the extent that  unincorporated consortia of separate organizations may submit proposals,  the notice should explain that an unincorporated consortium   would use the DUNS number of the entity proposed to receive DoD payments  under the award (usually, a lead organization that consortium members  identify for administrative matters). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\4\ This OMB policy directive is available at the Internet site  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/grants_docs.html (the link is ``Use  of a Universal Identifier by Grant Applicants''). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At least two eligible, prospective proposers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impartial review of the merits of applications or proposals  received in response to the notice, using the evaluation method and  selection criteria described in the notice. For research and development  awards, in order to be considered as part of a competitive procedure,  the two principal selection criteria, unless statute provides otherwise,  must be the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Technical merits of the proposed research and development; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Potential relationship of the proposed research and development  to Department of Defense missions.
