                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application. The following definitions, regulations, and  criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by  section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, title  VI (102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and  procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified  statutory authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect  the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an  interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions  relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and  responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of  action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress  to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by the prolonged detention of  property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving  possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances. The  definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as  contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities  small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for  personal consumption and not for distribution, and those larger  quantities generally considered to be subject to distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this subpart, the following terms shall  have the meanings specified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appraised value. ``Appraised value'' has the meaning given in  Sec. 162.43(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commercial fishing industry vessel. ``Commercial fishing  industry vessel'' means a vessel that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of  fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the  catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by  gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or  brine chilling; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports  fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the  preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish  tender vessel or fish processing facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Controlled substance. ``Controlled substance'' has the meaning  given in 21 U.S.C. 802.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Normal and customary manner. ``Normal and customary manner''  means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which  would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a  like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and  circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive  knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is  persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a  petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how  property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Owner or interested party. ``Owner or interested party'' means  one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for  foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time  of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting  the petition for expedited procedure. This includes a lienholder, to the  extent of his interest in the property, whose claim is in writing  (except for a maritime lien which need not be in writing), unless the  collateral is in the possession of the secured party. The agreement  securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in  the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(i)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Quantities presumed to be for personal use unless evidence of  illicit drug trafficking or distribution exists. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One gram of a  mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable  amount of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from  which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have  been removed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cocaine, its salts, optional and geometric isomers, and salts of  isomers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of  isomers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any  quantity of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(B)  (1) through (3) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> \1/10\th gram of a mixture of substances described in paragraph  (b)(6)(i)(B) of this section which contains cocaine base;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> \1/10\th gram of mixture of substance containing a detectable  amount of phencyclidine (PCP);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> 500 micrograms of a mixture of substance containing a detectable  amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable  amount of marihuana; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of  its isomers, or one gram of a mixture of substances containing a  detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of  its isomers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence of possession for other than personal use. Quantities  shall not be considered to be for personal use if sweepings are present  or there is other evidence of possession for other than personal use  such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Evidence such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia,  drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug  ``cutting'' agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to  process, package or distribute a controlled substance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a  controlled substance with intent to distribute;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in  actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for  offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to  distribute a controlled substance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or  any amount of prerecorded government funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that  indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for  distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large  quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the  possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate  possession with intent to distribute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Property. ``Property'' means property subject to forfeiture  under 19 U.S.C. 1595a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Seizing agency. ``Seizing agency'' means the Federal agency  which has seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency,  and has the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Sworn to. ``Sworn to'' refers to the oath as provided by 28  U.S.C. 1746 or as notarized in accordance with state law.
