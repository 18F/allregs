                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Asbestos is the common name for a group of natural  minerals that occur as masses of compact or relatively long silky  fibers. The Environmental Protection Agency classified asbestos as a  hazardous air pollutant in 1972.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Friable asbestos materials contain more than one percent  asbestos by weight and can, by hand pressure, be crumbled, pulverized,  or reduced to powder, thus allowing for potential release of asbestos  fibers into the air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonfriable asbestos materials cannot, when dry, be crumbled,  pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure and contain asbestos  which is bonded or otherwise rendered unavailable for release into the  atmosphere through normal usage. However, cutting, sanding, crushing, or  performing some other disruptive action on items containing nonfriable  asbestos can release asbestos fibers into the air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As noted in this Sec. 101-42.1102-1, property containing  friable asbestos   normally shall not be transferred, donated, or sold. Notwithstanding  these provisions, holding agencies may, on a case-by-case basis, request  approval from the GSA Central Office (which will consult with EPA) to  transfer, donate, or sell such property if, in the judgement of the  holding agency, special circumstances warrant such action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Utilization requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess personal property known to  contain friable asbestos shall not be reported to GSA nor transferred  among Federal agencies except as noted in Sec. 101-42.205(c) or  paragraph (a)(4) of this section. GSA regional offices shall return any  reports of excess property containing friable asbestos to the holding  agency with instructions to dispose of the property under paragraph (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excess personal property containing nonfriable asbestos shall be  reported and processed in the normal manner, as provided for in part  101-43, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Standard Form (SF) 120, Report of Excess Personal Property,  and SF 122, Transfer Order, Excess Personal Property, and any other  appropriate documentation shall include the following warning:</p><p class="depth4">Warning</p><p class="depth4">This property contains asbestos. Inhaling asbestos fibers may cause  cancer. Do not release fibers by cutting, crushing, sanding,  disassembling, or otherwise altering this property. End users and new  owners, if transferred, should be warned. OSHA standards for personnel  protection are codified at 29 CFR 1910.1001. EPA disposal standards are  codified at 40 CFR part 763.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Immediately after excess determination, all items of personal  property known to contain nonfriable asbestos shall be labeled with a  warning substantially as follows:</p><p class="depth4">Warning</p><p class="depth4">This property contains asbestos. Inhaling asbestos fibers may cause  cancer. Do not release fibers by cutting, crushing, sanding,  disassembling, or otherwise altering this property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Donation requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surplus personal property containing  friable asbestos shall not be donated. Such property shall be disposed  of under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surplus personal property containing nonfriable asbestos may be  donated in the normal manner as provided for in part 101-44, except  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sales requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surplus personal property containing  friable asbestos shall not be sold. Such property shall be disposed of  under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surplus personal property containing nonfriable asbestos may be  sold as provided for in part 101-45, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Abandonment and destruction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess or surplus personal  property which contains friable asbestos shall be disposed of by burial  in a site which meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.156. Holding  agencies should contact the nearest office of the Environmental  Protection Agency for assistance with regard to disposal of asbestos  containing materials (with the exception of Department of Defense  activities which should contact the Defense Logistics Agency).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personal property containing nonfriable asbestos which is not  transferred, donated, or sold shall be abandoned or destroyed as  provided for in subpart 101-45.9. However, if the holding agency judges  that the nonfriable asbestos contained in the property has the potential  of becoming friable for   any reason during the process of abandonment or destruction, such  property shall be disposed of as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this  section.</p>
