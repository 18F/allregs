An agency may not continue to pay an employee premium pay on an annual basis under this paragraph for more than 60 workdays in a calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an employee is not entitled to premium pay on an annual basis under Sec. 550.141, he is entitled to be paid for overtime, night, holiday, and Sunday work in accordance with other sections of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An agency shall continue to pay an employee premium pay on an annual basis under Sec. 550.141 or Sec. 550.151 while he is on leave with pay during a period in which premium pay on an annual basis is payable under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless an agency discontinues authorization of premium pay under Sec. 550.141 or Sec. 550.151 for all similar positions, it may not discontinue authorization of such premium pay for an individual employee's position--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During a period of paid leave elected by the employee and approved by the agency in lieu of benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.), following a job-related injury;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During a period of continuation of pay under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During a period of leave without pay, if the employee is in receipt of benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.).
