These engines are not required to comply with this part 1039 or 40 CFR part 89, but 40 CFR 1068.101 prohibits the use of competition engines for noncompetition purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We consider a vehicle or piece of equipment to be one that will be used solely for competition if it has features that are not easily removed that would make its use other than in competition unsafe, impractical, or highly unlikely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As an engine manufacturer, your engine is exempt without our prior approval if you have a written request for an exempted engine from the equipment manufacturer showing the basis for believing that the equipment will be used solely for competition. You must permanently label engines exempted under this section to clearly indicate that they are to be used solely for competition. Failure to properly label an engine will void the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may discontinue an exemption under this section if we find that engines are not used solely for competition.</p>
