                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cost-of-service rates. A carrier may change a rate pursuant to  this section if it shows that there is a substantial divergence between  the actual costs experienced by the carrier and the rate resulting from  application of the index such that the rate at the ceiling level would  preclude the carrier from being able to charge a just and reasonable  rate within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. A carrier must  substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by part 346  of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate  in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the  rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under Sec. 342.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Market-based rates. A carrier may attempt to show that it lacks  significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge  market-based rates. Until the carrier establishes that it lacks market  power, these rates will be subject to the applicable ceiling level under  Sec. 342.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Settlement rates. A carrier may change a rate without regard to  the ceiling level under Sec. 342.3 if the proposed change has been  agreed to, in writing, by each person who, on the day of the filing of  the proposed rate change, is using the service covered by the rate. A  filing pursuant to this section must contain a verified statement by the  carrier that the proposed rate change has been agreed to by all current  shippers.
