must have a design approval certificate. An owner or manufacturer must apply to an approval agency that is approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with subpart E of part 107 of this chapter + to obtain approval of a new design. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design, the certificate is valid for the entire series. The design approval certificate must refer to the prototype test report, the materials of construction of the manifold, the standards to which the pressure receptacles are made and an approval number. The compliance requirements or test methods applicable to MEGCs as specified in this subpart may be varied when the level of safety is determined to be equivalent to or exceed the requirements of this subchapter and is approved in writing by the Associate Administrator.

Any approvals by the Associate Administrator authorizing design or construction alternatives (Alternate Arrangements) of the MEGC (see paragraph (a) of this section) must be indicated on the metal identification plate as specified in Sec. 178.75(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prepare an approval certificate for each MEGC or, in the case of a series of identical MEGCs manufactured to a single design type, for each series of MEGCs. The approval certificate must include all of the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information displayed on the metal identification plate required by Sec. 178.75(j);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The results of the applicable framework test specified in ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The results of the initial inspection and test specified in paragraph (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The results of the impact test specified in Sec. 178.75(i)(4);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Certification documents verifying that the cylinders and tubes conform to the applicable standards; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A statement that the approval agency certifies the MEGC in accordance with the procedures in this section and that the MEGC is suitable for its intended purpose and meets the requirements of this subchapter. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design type, the certificate may be valid for the entire series of MEGCs representing a single design type. The approval number must consist of the distinguishing sign or mark of the country (``USA'' for the United States of America) where the approval was granted and a registration number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Retain on file a copy of each approval certificate for at least 20 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacturers' responsibilities. The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the applicable specifications for the design and construction of MEGCs. The manufacturer of a MEGC must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comply with all the requirements of the applicable ISO standard specified in Sec. 178.71;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain and use an approval agency to review the design, construction and certification of the MEGC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a statement in the manufacturers' data report certifying that each MEGC manufactured complies with the relevant specification and all the applicable requirements of this subchapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Retain records for the MEGCs for at least 20 years. When required by the specification, the manufacturer must provide copies of the records to the approval agency, the owner or lessee of the MEGC, and to a representative of DOT, upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of application for approval. If the Associate Administrator finds that the MEGC will not be approved for any reason, the Associate Administrator will notify the applicant in writing and provide the reason for the denial.
