                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of this section, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is no longer acceptable due to traffic interference. For those FWS transportation systems that require a CMS, in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration shall be given to strategies that reduce private automobile travel and improve existing transportation system efficiency. Approaches may include the use of alternate mode studies and implementation plans as components of the CMS. The FWS shall consider the results of the CMS when selecting the implementation of strategies that provide the most efficient and effective use of existing and future transportation facilities, and alleviate congestion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements provided in Sec. 972.204, the CMS must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For portions of the FWS transportation system within TMAs, the FWS transportation planning process shall include a CMS that meets the requirements of this section. By agreement between the TMA and the FWS, the TMA's CMS coverage may include the transportation facilities serving the Refuge System, as appropriate. Through this agreement(s), the FWS may meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If congestion exists at a FWS facility within the boundaries of a TMA, and the TMA's CMS does not provide coverage of the portions of the FWS transportation facilities experiencing congestion, the FWS shall develop a separate CMS to cover those facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For portions of the FWS transportation system outside the boundaries of TMAs, the FWS shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Develop criteria to determine when a CMS is to be implemented for a specific transportation system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have CMS coverage for all transportation facilities serving the Refuge System, as appropriate, funded through the FLHP that meet minimum CMS needs criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A CMS will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify and document measures for congestion (e.g., level of service);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the causes of congestion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include processes for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies to manage congestion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identify the anticipated benefits of appropriate alternative traditional and nontraditional congestion management strategies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Determine methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the multi-modal transportation system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Appropriately consider the following example categories of strategies, or combinations of strategies for each area:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transportation demand management measures;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Traffic operational improvements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Public transportation improvements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> ITS technologies;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Additional system capacity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Provide information supporting the implementation of actions.</p>
