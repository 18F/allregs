The United States will bear the balance of the costs, including that part attributable to the necessities of navigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Direct and special benefits'' ordinarily will include items desired by the owner but which have no counterpart or are of higher quality than similar items in the bridge prior to alteration. Examples include improved signal and fender systems, pro rata share of dismantling costs, and improvements included, but not required, in the interests of navigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During the development of the Apportionment of Costs, the bridge owner will be provided with an opportunity to be heard. Proportionate shares of cost to be borne by the United States and the bridge owner are developed in substantially the following form:
