For example, where the label  indicates that a particular fiber is present in the amount of 40  percent, the amount of such fiber present may vary from a minimum of 37  percent of the total fiber weight of such product to a maximum of 43  percent of the total fiber weight of such product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the percentage of any fiber or fibers contained in a  textile fiber product deviates or varies from the percentage stated on  the label by more than the tolerance or variation provided in paragraph  (a) of this section, such product shall be misbranded unless the person  charged proves that the entire deviation or variation from the fiber  content percentages stated on the label resulted from unavoidable  variations in manufacture and despite the exercise of due care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where representations are made to the effect that a textile  fiber product is composed wholly of one fiber, the tolerance provided in  section 4(b)(2) of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section shall not  apply, except as to permissive ornamentation where the textile fiber  product is represented to be composed of one fiber ``exclusive of  ornamentation.''</p>
