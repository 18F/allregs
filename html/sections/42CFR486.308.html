An OPO is normally designated for a 4-year agreement cycle. The period may be shorter, for example, if an OPO has voluntarily terminated its agreement with CMS and CMS selects a successor OPO for the balance of the 4-year agreement cycle. In rare situations, a designation period may be longer, for example, a designation may be extended if additional time is needed to select a successor OPO to replace an OPO that has been de-certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Re-Certification.

If a waiver request is denied, a hospital must enter into an agreement with the designated OPO within 30 days of notification of the final determination.
