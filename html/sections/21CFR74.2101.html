                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. The color additive FD&C; Blue No. 1 is principally the  disodium salt of ethyl[4-[p-[ethyl(m-sulfobenzyl)amino]-[alpha]-(o- sulfophenyl)benzylidene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene](m- sulfobenzyl)ammonium hydroxide inner salt with smaller amounts of the  isomeric disodium salts of ethyl[4-[p-[ethyl(p-sulfobenzyl)amino]- [alpha]-(o-sulfophenyl)benzylidene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene](p- sulfobenzyl)ammonium hydroxide inner salt and ethyl[4-[p-[ethyl(o- sulfobenzyl)amino]-[alpha]-(o-sulfophenyl)benzylidene]-2,5- cyclohexadien-1-ylidene](o-sulfobenzyl)ammonium hydroxide inner salt.  Additionally, FD&C; Blue No. 1 is manufactured by the acid catalyzed  condensation of one mole of sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate with two  moles from a mixture consisting principally of 3- [(ethylphenylamino)methyl] benzenesulfonic acid, and smaller amounts of  4-[(ethylphenylamino)methyl] benzenesulfonic acid and 2- [(ethylphenylamino)methyl] benzenesulfonic acid to form the leuco base.  The leuco base is then oxidized with lead dioxide and acid, or with  dichromate and acid, or with manganese dioxide and acid to form the dye.  The intermediate sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate is prepared from 2- chlorobenzaldehyde and sodium sulfite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive FD&C; Blue No. 1 shall  conform in specifications to the requirements of Sec. 74.101(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FD&C; Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake shall be prepared in accordance  with the requirements of Sec. 82.51 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FD&C; Blue No. 1 may be safely used  for coloring cosmetics generally, including cosmetics intended for use  in the area of the eye, in amounts consistent with current good  manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FD&C; Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake may be safely used for coloring  cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, in amounts consistent  with current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling.
