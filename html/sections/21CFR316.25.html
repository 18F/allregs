A sponsor's failure to comply with Sec. 316.21 shall constitute a failure to make the demonstration required in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is insufficient information about the drug, or the disease or condition for which it is intended, to establish a medically plausible basis for expecting the drug to be effective in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of that disease or condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The drug is otherwise the same drug as an already approved drug for the same rare disease or condition and the sponsor has not submitted a medically plausible hypothesis for the possible clinical superiority of the subsequent drug.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FDA may refuse to grant a request for orphan-drug designation if the request for designation contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits material information or if the request is otherwise ineligible under this part.
