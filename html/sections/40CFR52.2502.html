This section applies to the Alcoa Inc.--Wenatchee  Works primary aluminum smelter (Wenatchee Works) located near Wenatchee,  Washington and to its successors and/or assignees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance demonstration. Alcoa must determine SO2  emissions, on a calendar month basis using the following formulas:  SO2 emissions in pounds = (carbon ratio) x (tons of aluminum  produced during the calendar month) x (% sulfur in baked anodes/100) x  (% sulfur converted to SO2/100) x (2 pounds of SO2  per pound of sulfur) x (2000 pounds per ton)     SO2 emissions in pounds per ton of aluminum produced =  (SO2 emissions in pounds during the calendar month)/(tons of  aluminum produced during the calendar month)</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The carbon ratio is the calendar month average of tons of baked  anodes consumed per ton of aluminum produced as determined using the  baked anode consumption and aluminum production records required in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The % sulfur in baked anodes is the calendar month average  sulfur content as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The % sulfur converted to SO2 is 90%.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Emission monitoring. The % sulfur of baked anodes must be  determined using ASTM Method D6376 or an alternative method approved by  the EPA Region 10.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At a minimum, Alcoa must collect no less than four baked anode  core samples during each calendar week.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Calendar month average sulfur content must be determined by  averaging the sulfur content of all samples collected during the  calendar month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particulate matter (PM) emission limit.

Alcoa must determine NOX  emissions, on a calendar month basis using the following formula:  NOX emissions in tons per calendar month = (the emission  factor determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in pounds  of NOX per ton of aluminum produced) x (number of tons of  aluminum produced in the calendar month)/(2000 pounds per ton).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> NOX emission factor development. By September 9, 2014, Alcoa  must submit to the EPA a plan for testing NOX emissions from  Potline 5 and developing an emission factor in terms of pounds of  NOX per ton of aluminum produced. This plan must include  testing NOX emissions from both the Gas Treatment Center  stack and the potline roof vents along with measurements of volumetric  flow and aluminum production such that mass emissions can be determined  and correlated with aluminum production. Within 90 days after the EPA  approval of the plan, Alcoa shall conduct the testing and submit the  resultant emission factor to the EPA at the address listed in paragraph  (i)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NOX emission limit. NOX emission limit in tons per  calendar month = (the emission factor determined under paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in pounds of NOX per ton of  aluminum produced) x (5546.2 tons of aluminum per month)/(2000 pounds  per ton).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance demonstration. The weighted monthly average sulfur  content of coke used in manufacturing shall be calculated as follows:  Weighted average percent sulfur =  [sum](C1-nxSC1-n/100)/[sum]C1-n*100  Where:  Cn is the quantity of coke in shipment n in tons SCn is the percent sulfur content by weight of the coke in</p><p class="depth4">shipment n n is the number of shipments of coke in the calendar month</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Emission monitoring. Alcoa must test each shipment of coke for  sulfur content using ASTM Method D6376 or an alternative method approved  by the EPA Region 10. Written documentation from the coke supplier  certifying the sulfur content is an approved alternative method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particulate matter (PM) emission limit. Starting November 10,  2014, the PM emissions from the anode bake furnaces stack must not  exceed 0.01 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission limit.
