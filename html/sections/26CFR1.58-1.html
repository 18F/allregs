                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of the minimum tax for tax preferences (subtitle A, chapter 1A, part VI), the minimum tax exemption is $30,000 except as otherwise provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Husband and wife. In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, section 58(a) provides that the minimum tax exemption is $15,000. This rule applies without regard to whether the married individual is living together with or apart from his spouse and without regard to whether or not his spouse has any items of tax preference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Members of controlled groups--(1) Amount of exemption--(i) General rule. Under section 58(b), if a corporation is a component member of a controlled group of corporations on December 31 (as defined in section 1563 (a) and (b) and the regulations thereunder), the minimum tax exemption for such taxable year which includes such December 31 is an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $30,000 divided by the number of corporations which are component members of such group on December 31, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If an apportionment plan is adopted under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, such portion of the $30,000 as is apportioned to such member in accordance with such plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consolidated returns. The minimum tax exemption of a controlled group all of whose component members join in the filing of a consolidated return is $30,000. If there are component members of the controlled group which do not join in the filing of a consolidated return, and there is no apportionment plan effective under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph apportioning the $30,000 among the component members filing the consolidated return and the other component members of the controlled group, each component member of the controlled group (including each component member which joins in filing the consolidated return) is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of equally apportioning the $30,000 amount under subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph. In such case, the minimum tax exemption of the corporations filing the consolidated return is the sum of the amounts apportioned to each component member which joins in the filing of the consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain short taxable years. If the return of a corporation is for a short

period which does not include a December 31, and such corporation is a component member of a controlled group of corporations with respect to such short period, the minimum tax exemption of such corporation for such short period is an amount equal to $30,000 divided by the number of corporations which are component members of such group on the last day of such short period. The minimum tax exemption so determined is also subject to the rules of section 443(d) (relating to reduction in the amount of the exemption for short periods) and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``short period'' does not include any period if the income for such period is required to be included in a consolidated return under Sec.  1.1502-76(b). The determination of whether a corporation is a component member of a controlled group of corporations on the last day of a short period is made by applying the definition of ``component member'' contained in section 1563(b) and Sec.  1.1563-1 as if the last day of such short period were a December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Apportionment of minimum tax exemption--(i) Apportionment plan--(a) In general. In the case of corporations which are component members of a controlled group of corporations on a December 31, a single minimum tax exemption may be apportioned among such members if all such members consent, in the manner provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, to an apportionment plan with respect to such December 31. Such plan must provide for the apportionment of a fixed dollar amount to one or more of such members, but in no event may the sum of the amount so apportioned exceed $30,000. An apportionment plan is not considered as adopted with respect to a particular December 31 until each component member which is required to consent to the plan under subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph files the original of a statement described in such subdivision (or, the original of a statement incorporating its consent is filed on its behalf). In the case of a return filed before a plan is adopted, the minimum tax exemption for purposes of such return is to be equally apportioned in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If a valid apportionment plan is adopted after the return is filed and within the time prescribed in (b) of this subdivision (i), such return must be amended (or a claim for refund should be made) to reflect the change from equal apportionment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time for adopting plan. A controlled group may adopt an apportionment plan with respect to a particular December 31 only if, at the time such plan is sought to be adopted, there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of the deficiency against any corporation the tax liability of which would be increased by the adoption of such plan. If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any such corporation, the district director or the director of the service center with whom such corporation files its income tax return will ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for the limited purpose of assessing any deficiency against such corporation attributable to the adoption of such apportionment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Years for which effective. (1) The amount apportioned to a component member of a controlled group of corporations in an apportionment plan adopted with respect to a particular December 31 constitutes such member's minimum tax exemption for its taxable year including the particular December 31, and for all taxable years including succeeding December 31's, unless the apportionment plan is amended in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph or is terminated under paragraph (c)(2) of this subdivision (i). Thus, the apportionment plan (including any amendments thereof) has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount apportioned to a component member of a controlled group of corporations in an apportionment plan adopted with respect to a particular December 31 constitutes such member's minimum tax exemption for its taxable year including the particular December 31, and for all taxable years including succeeding December 31's, unless the apportionment plan is amended in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph or is terminated under paragraph (c)(2) of this subdivision (i). Thus, the apportionment plan (including any amendments thereof) has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an apportionment plan is adopted with respect to a particular December 31, such plan terminates with respect to a succeeding December 31, if: the controlled group goes out of existence with respect to such succeeding December 31 within the meaning of paragraph (b) of Sec.  1.1562-5, any corporation which was a component member of such group on the particular December 31 is not a component member of such group on such succeeding December 31,

or any corporation which was not a component member of such group on the particular December 31 is a component member of such group on such succeeding December 31. An apportionment plan, once terminated with respect to a December 31, is no longer effective. Accordingly, unless a new apportionment plan is adopted, the minimum tax exemption of the component members of the controlled group for their taxable years which include such December 31 and all December 31's thereafter will be determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an apportionment plan is terminated with respect to a particular December 31 by reason of the addition or withdrawal of a component member, each corporation which is a component member of the controlled group on such particular December 31 must, on or before the date it files its income tax return for the taxable year which includes such particular December 31, notify the district director or the director of the service center with whom it files such return to such termination. If an apportionment plan is terminated with respect to a particular December 31 by reason of the controlled group going out of existence, each corporation which was a component member of the controlled group on the preceding December 31 must, on or before the date it files its income tax return for the taxable year which includes such particular December 31, notify the district director or the director of the service center with whom it files such return to such termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consents to plan--(a) General rule. (1) The consent of a component member (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary) to an apportionment plan with respect to a particular December 31 is to be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the consenting member, stating that such member consents to the apportionment plan with respect to such December 31. The statement must set forth the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of the consenting component member, the amount apportioned to such member under the plan, and the internal revenue district or service center where the original of the statement is to be filed. The consent of more than one component member may be incorporated in a single statement. The original of a statement of consent is to be filed with the district director or the director of the service center with whom the component member of the group on such December 31 which has the taxable year ending first on or after such date filed its return for such taxable year. If two or more component members have the same such taxable year, a statement of consent may be filed with the district director or the director of the service center with whom the return for any such taxable year is filed. The original of a statement of consent is to have attached thereto information (referred to in this subdivision as ``group identification'') setting forth the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of each component member of the controlled group on such December 31 (including wholly-owned subsidiaries) and the amount apportioned to each such member under the plan. If more than one original statement is filed, a statement may incorporate the group identification by reference to the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of the component member of the group which has attached such group identification to the original of its statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each component member of the group on such December 31 (other than wholly-owned subsidiaries) must attach a copy of its consent (or a copy of the statement incorporating its consent) to the income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund filed with its district director or director of the service center for the taxable year including such date. Such copy must either have attached thereto information on group identification or must incorporate such information by reference to the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of the component member of the group which has attached such information to its income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund filed with the same district director or director of the service center for the taxable year including such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Wholly-owned subsidiaries. (1) Each component member of a controlled group which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of such group with respect to a December 31 is deemed to consent to an apportionment plan with respect to such December 31, provided each component member of the group which is not a wholly-owned subsidiary consents to the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, a component member of a controlled group is considered to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group with respect to a December 31, if, on each day preceding such date and during its taxable year which includes such date, all of its stock is owned directly by one or more corporations which are component members of the group on such December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each component member of a controlled group which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of such group with respect to a December 31 is deemed to consent to an apportionment plan with respect to such December 31, provided each component member of the group which is not a wholly-owned subsidiary consents to the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, a component member of a controlled group is considered to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group with respect to a December 31, if, on each day preceding such date and during its taxable year which includes such date, all of its stock is owned directly by one or more corporations which are component members of the group on such December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each wholly-owned subsidiary of a controlled group with respect to a December 31 must attach a statement containing the information which is required to be set forth in a statement of consent to an apportionment plan with respect to such December 31 to the income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund filed with its district director or director of the service center for the taxable year which includes such date. Such statement must either have attached thereto information on group identification or incorporate such information by reference to the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of a component member of the group which has attached such information to its income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund filed with the same district director or director of the service center for the taxable year including such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amendment of plan. An apportionment plan adopted with respect to a December 31 by a controlled group of corporations may be amended with respect to such December 31 or with respect to any succeeding December 31 for which the plan is effective under subdivision (i)(c) of this subparagraph. An apportionment plan must be amended with respect to a particular December 31 and the amendments to the plan are effective only if adopted in accordance with the rules prescribed in this paragraph for the adoption of an original plan with respect to such December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Component members filing consolidated return. If the component members of a controlled group of corporations on a December 31 include corporations which join the filing of a consolidated return, the corporations filing the consolidated return are treated as a single component member for purposes of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, only one consent executed by the common parent to an apportionment plan filed pursuant to this section is required on behalf of the component members filing the consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Estates and trusts. Section 58(c)(2) provides that, in the case of an estate or trust, the minimum tax exemption applicable to such estate or trust is an amount which bears the same ratio to $30,000 as the portion of the sum of the items of tax preference apportioned to the estate or trust bears to the full sum before apportionment. For example, if one-third of the sum of the items of tax preference of a trust are subject to tax at the trust level after apportionment under section 58(c)(1) and Sec.  1.58-3, the trust's minimum tax exemption is $10,000. See Sec.  1.58-3 for rules with respect to the apportionment of items of tax preference of an estate or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Short taxable year. See section 443(d) and Sec.  1.443-1(d) with respect to reduction in the amount of the minimum tax exemption in the case of a short taxable year.
