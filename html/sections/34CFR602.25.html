                            <p class="depth0">The agency must demonstrate that the procedures it uses throughout  the accrediting process satisfy due process. The agency meets this  requirement if the agency does the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Provides adequate written specification of its requirements,  including clear standards, for an institution or program to be  accredited or preaccredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Uses procedures that afford an institution or program a  reasonable period of time to comply with the agency's requests for  information and documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provides written specification of any deficiencies identified at  the institution or program examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provides sufficient opportunity for a written response by an  institution or program regarding any deficiencies identified by the  agency, to be considered by the agency within a timeframe determined by  the agency, and before any adverse action is taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notifies the institution or program in writing of any adverse  accrediting action or an action to place the institution or program on  probation or show cause. The notice describes the basis for the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Provides an opportunity, upon written request of an institution  or program, for the institution or program to appeal any adverse action  prior to the action becoming final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appeal must take place at a hearing before an appeals panel  that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May not include current members of the agency's decision-making  body that took the initial adverse action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is subject to a conflict of interest policy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not serve only an advisory or procedural role, and has  and uses the authority to make the following decisions: to affirm,  amend, or reverse adverse actions of the original decision-making body;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Affirms, amends, reverses, or remands the adverse action. A  decision to affirm, amend, or reverse the adverse action is implemented  by the appeals panel or by the original decision-making body, at the  agency's option. In a decision to remand the adverse action to the  original decision-making body for further consideration, the appeals  panel must identify specific issues that the original decision-making  body must address. In a decision that is implemented by or remanded to  the original decision-making body, that body must act in a manner  consistent with the appeals panel's decisions or instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must recognize the right of the institution or  program to employ counsel to represent the institution or program during  its appeal, including to make any presentation that the agency permits  the institution or program to make on its own during the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The agency notifies the institution or program in writing of the  result of its appeal and the basis for that result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency must provide for a process, in accordance with  written procedures, through which an institution or program may, before  the agency reaches a final adverse action decision, seek review of new  financial information if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The financial information was unavailable to the institution or  program until after the decision subject to appeal was made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The financial information is significant and bears materially  on the financial deficiencies identified by the agency. The criteria of  significance and materiality are determined by the agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The only remaining deficiency cited by the agency in support  of a final adverse action decision is the institution's or program's  failure to meet an agency standard pertaining to finances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An institution or program may seek the review of new financial  information described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section only once and  any determination by the agency made with respect to that review does  not provide a basis for an appeal.
