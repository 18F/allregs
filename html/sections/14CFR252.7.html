Sec. 252.3 and 252.13 do not apply shall provide, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A no-smoking section for each class of service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A sufficient number of seats in each no-smoking section to accommodate all persons in that class of service who wish to be seated there;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expansion of no-smoking sections to meet passenger demand; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special provisions to ensure that if a no-smoking section is placed between smoking sections, the nonsmoking passengers are not unreasonably burdened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On flights for which passengers may make confirmed reservations and on which seats are assigned before

boarding, an air carrier need not provide a seat in a no-smoking section to a passenger who has not met the carrier's requirements as to time and method of obtaining a seat on the flight, or who does not have a confirmed reservation. If a seat is available in the established no-smoking section, however, an air carrier shall seat there any enplaning passenger who so requests, regardless of boarding time or reservation status.</p>
