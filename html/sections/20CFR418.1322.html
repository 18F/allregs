                                Sec. 418.1322  How will a Medicare prescription drug coverage income- affect your Medicare  Part B?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If we make an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination  for you for the effective year under subpart C of this part (Medicare  Prescription Drug Coverage Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount), we  will apply that income-related monthly adjustment amount determination  under this subpart to determine your Part D income-related monthly  adjustment amount for the same effective year. Therefore, if you become  enrolled in Medicare Part B in the effective year after we make an  income-related monthly adjustment amount determination about your  Medicare prescription drug coverage, the income-related monthly  adjustment amount determination for your Medicare prescription drug  coverage will also be used to determine your Medicare Part B income- related monthly adjustment amount. Any change in your net benefit due  will be accompanied by a letter explaining the change in your net  benefit and your right to appeal the change.  [75 FR 75890, Dec. 7, 2010]</p>
