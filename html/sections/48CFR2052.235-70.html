However, such publication and papers shall focus on advances in science and technology and minimize conclusions and/or recommendations which may have regulatory implications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The principal investigator(s) shall coordinate all such publications with, and transmit a copy of the proposed article or paper to, the NRC Contracting Officer or Project Officer, prior to publication. The NRC agrees to review and provide comments within thirty (30) days after receipt of a proposed publication. However, in those cases where the information to be published is (1) subject to Commission approval, (2) has not been ruled upon, or (3) disapproved by the Commission, the NRC reserves the right to disapprove or delay the publication. Further, if the NRC disagrees with the proposed publication for any reason, it reserves the right to require that any publication not identify the NRC's sponsorship of the work and that any associated publication costs shall be borne by the contractor.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
