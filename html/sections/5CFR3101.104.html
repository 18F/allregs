All Department of the  Treasury employees shall obtain prior written approval before engaging  in any outside employment or business activities, with or without  compensation, except to the extent that the employing bureau issues an  instruction or manual issuance pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section  exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement.  Approval shall be granted only on a determination that the employment or  activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, part  2635 of this title, or any provision of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Employees of the ATF, IRS, Legal Division, OCC, USCS and  United States Secret Service are subject to additional limitations on  outside employment and activities that are set out in bureau-specific  rules contained in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bureau responsibilities. Each bureau, which for the purposes of  this section includes the Departmental Offices and the Office of the  Inspector General, shall issue instructions or manual issuances  governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment  or business activities and designating appropriate officials to act on  such requests. The instructions or manual issuances may exempt  categories of employment or activities from the prior approval  requirement based on a determination that employment or activities  within those categories would generally be approved and are not likely  to involve conduct prohibited by statute, part 2635 of this title or any  provision of this part. Bureaus may include in their instructions or  issuances examples of outside employment or activities that are  permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and part 2635 of  this title. Bureaus shall retain in employees' Official Personnel  Folders (temporary side) all requests for approval whether granted or  denied.</p>
