                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Declarations and reports of exports and imports of Schedule 2  chemicals--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Declarations. A Schedule 2 plant site that is declared  because it produced, processed or consumed a Schedule 2 chemical at one  or more plants above the applicable threshold set forth in paragraph (b)  of this section, and also exported from or imported to the plant site  that same Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold, must  submit export and import information as part of its declaration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reports. The following persons must submit a report if they  individually exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical above the  applicable threshold indicated in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A declared plant site that exported or imported a Schedule 2  chemical that was different than the Schedule 2 chemical produced,  processed or consumed at one or more plants at the plant site above the  applicable declaration threshold;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An undeclared plant site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A trading company; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other person subject to the CWCR.</p><p class="depth4">Note to Sec. 713.3(a)(1) and (a)(2)(i): A declared Schedule 2 plant  site may need to declare exports or imports of Schedule 2 chemicals that  it produced, processed or consumed above the applicable threshold and  also report exports or imports of different Schedule 2 chemicals that it  did not produce, process or consume above the applicable threshold  quantities. The report may be submitted to BIS either with or separately  from the annual declaration on past activities (see Sec. 713.3(d) of  the CWCR).</p><p class="depth4">Note to Sec. 713.3(a)(2): The U.S. Government will not submit to  the OPCW company-specific information relating to the export or import  of Schedule 2 chemicals contained in reports. The U.S. Government will  add all export and import information contained in   reports to export and import information contained in declarations to  establish the U.S. national aggregate declaration on exports and  imports.</p><p class="depth4">Note to Sec. 713.3(a)(1) and (2): Declared and undeclared plant  sites must count, for declaration or reporting purposes, all exports  from and imports to the entire plant site, not only from or to  individual plants on the plant site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quantities of exports or imports that trigger a declaration or  reporting requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have a declaration or reporting  requirement and must complete the forms specified in paragraph (d) of  this section if you exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical in excess  of the following threshold quantities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 1 kilogram of chemical BZ: 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (See  Schedule 2, paragraph A.3 included in Supplement No. 1 to this part);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 100 kilograms of chemical PFIB: 1,1,3,3,3-Pentafluoro- 2(trifluoromethyl)-1-propene or 100 kilograms of Amiton: O,O Diethyl S- [2(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothiolate and corresponding alkylated or  protonated salts (see Schedule 2, paragraphs A.1 and A.2 included in  Supplement No.1 to this part); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 1 metric ton of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see  Supplement No.1 to this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mixtures containing a Schedule 2 chemical. The quantity of each  Schedule 2 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for the  declaration or reporting of an export or import only if the  concentration of each Schedule 2 chemical in the mixture is 30% or more  by volume or by weight, whichever yields the lesser percent. You must  declare separately each Schedule 2 chemical whose concentration in the  mixture is 30% or more.</p><p class="depth3">Note 1 to Sec. 713.3(b)(2): See Sec. 713.2(a)(2)(ii) of the CWCR  for information on counting amounts of Schedule 2 chemicals contained in  mixtures and determining declaration and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth3">Note 2 to Sec. 713.3(b)(2): The ``30% and above'' mixtures rule  applies only for declaration and reporting purposes. This rule does not  apply for purposes of determining whether the export of your mixture to  a non-State Party requires an End-Use Certificate or for determining  whether you need an export license from BIS (see Sec. 742.2, Sec.  742.18 and Sec. 745.2 of the Export Administration Regulations) or from  the Department of State (see the International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through130)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Declaration and reporting requirements--(1) Annual declaration  on past activities. A plant site described in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this  section that has an annual declaration requirement for the production,  processing, or consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical for the previous  calendar year also must declare the export and/or import of that same  Schedule 2 chemical if the amount exceeded the applicable threshold set  forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The plant site must declare such  export or import information as part of its annual declaration of past  activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> through (iv) of this section) subject to the CWCR that  exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical in a previous calendar year  in excess of the applicable thresholds set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section must submit an annual report on such exports or imports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Types of declaration and reporting forms to be used--(1) Annual  declaration on past activities. If you are a declared Schedule 2 plant  site, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must  complete Form 2-3B, in addition to the forms required by Sec.  713.2(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the CWCR, for each declared Schedule 2 chemical exported  or imported above the applicable threshold in the previous calendar  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, you may  fulfill your annual reporting requirements by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Submitting, with your annual declaration on past activities, a  Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above  the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is  optional; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Submitting, separately from your annual declaration on past  activities, a Certification Form, Form 2-1, and   Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above  the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is  optional.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you are an undeclared plant site, trading company or any  other person subject to the CWCR, you must complete the Certification  Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported  or imported above the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as  appropriate; Form B is optional.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Quantities to be declared--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculations. If you exported  from or imported to your plant site, trading company, or other location  more than the applicable threshold of a Schedule 2 chemical in the  previous calendar year, you must declare or report all exports and  imports of that chemical by country of destination or country of origin,  respectively, and indicate the total amount exported to or imported from  each country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rounding. For purposes of declaring or reporting exports and  imports of a Schedule 2 chemical, you must total all exports and imports  per calendar year per recipient or source and then round as follows: For  the chemical BZ, the total quantity for each country of destination or  country of origin (source) should be reported to the nearest hundredth  of a kilogram (10 grams); for PFIB and Amiton and corresponding  alkylated or protonated salts, the quantity for each destination or  source should be reported to the nearest 1 kilogram; and for all other  Schedule 2 chemicals, the total quantity for each destination or source  should be reported to the nearest 10 kilograms.</p>
