                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Signature of bearer. A passport book is valid only when signed  by the bearer in the space designated for signature, or, if the bearer  is unable to sign, signed by a person with legal authority to sign on  his or her behalf. A passport card is valid without the signature of the  bearer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Period of validity of a regular passport and a passport card.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A regular passport or passport card issued to an applicant 16 years  of age or older is valid for ten years from date of issue unless the  Department limits the validity period to a shorter period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A regular passport or passport card issued to an applicant under  16 years of age is valid for five years from date of issue unless the  Department limits the validity period to a shorter period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A regular passport for which payment of the fee has been excused  is valid for a period of five years from the date issued unless limited  by the Department to a shorter period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Period of validity of an official passport. The period of  validity of an official passport, unless limited by the Department to a  shorter period, is five years from the date of issue, or so long as the  bearer maintains his or her official status, whichever is shorter. An  official passport which has not expired must be returned to the  Department upon the termination of the bearer's official status or at  such other time as the Department may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Period of validity of a diplomatic passport. The period of  validity of a diplomatic passport, unless limited by the Department to a  shorter period, is five years from the date of issue, or so long as the  bearer maintains his or her diplomatic status, whichever is shorter. A  diplomatic passport which has not expired must be returned to the  Department upon the termination of the bearer's diplomatic status or at  such other time as the Department may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitation of validity. The validity period of any passport may  be limited by the Department to less than the normal validity period.  The bearer of a limited passport may apply for a new passport, using the  proper application and submitting the limited passport, applicable fees,  photographs, and additional documentation, if required, to support the  issuance of a new passport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Invalidity. A United States passport is invalid as soon as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Department has sent or personally delivered a written notice  to the bearer stating that the passport has been revoked; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The passport has been reported as lost or stolen to the  Department, a U.S. passport agency or a diplomatic or consular post  abroad and the Department has recorded the reported loss or theft; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The passport is cancelled by the Department (physically,  electronically, or otherwise) upon issuance of a new passport of the  same type to the bearer; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Department has sent a written notice to the bearer that the  passport has been invalidated because the Department has not received  the applicable fees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The passport has been materially changed in physical appearance  or composition, or contains a damaged, defective or otherwise  nonfunctioning chip, or includes unauthorized changes, obliterations,  entries or photographs, or has observable wear or tear that renders it  unfit for use as a travel document, and the Department either takes  possession of the passport or sends a written notice to the bearer.
