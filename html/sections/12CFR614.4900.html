such transactions and must have established bank procedures to safeguard the interests of the stockholders of the bank in regard to such transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under policies adopted by the bank's board of directors, a bank for cooperatives or an agricultural credit bank may engage in currency exchange activities necessary to service individual transactions that may be financed under the regulations authorizing export, import, and other internationally related credit and financial services. These currency exchange activities shall not include any loans or commitments intended to finance speculative futures transactions by eligible borrowers in foreign currencies. The bank may engage, on behalf of the eligible borrowers or on its own behalf, in bona fide hedging transactions and positions, where such transactions or positions normally reduce risks in the conduct and management of international financial activities.

The bank will be expected to maintain documentary evidence that a customer's delivery exposure is reasonable, and that responsible bank officers routinely review outstanding delivery exposure of individual customers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The bank's personnel policies shall include written standards of conduct for those involved with foreign exchange activities, including the following which should be prohibited:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trading with entities affiliated with the bank or with members of the board of directors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign exchange and deposit transactions with other bank employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal business relationships with foreign exchange and money brokers with whom the bank deals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The bank's policies should provide detailed instructions regarding the need for bank officers to disclose the limits of responsibility and liability of the bank when it holds positions or executes contracts for the account of eligible parties. The bank's policies regarding the respective procedures should provide reasonable assurance that reports on trading activities are current and complete, and that the opportunity for concealment of unauthorized transactions is kept at the absolute minimum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks shall use the Funding Corporation for purposes of trading foreign exchange. All foreign exchange transactions shall be made by the Funding Corporation on behalf of the banks consistent with instructions received from the respective banks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Guidelines (b) through (i) of this section will not apply if a bank purchases or sells foreign exchange through a commercial bank and has no foreign exchange risk exposure.
