                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 2672 of title 28 U.S. Code, as above amended, provides  that:</p><p class="depth2">The head of each Federal agency or his designee, in accordance with  regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, may consider, ascertain,  adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for injury or death  caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of  the agency while acting within the scope of his office or employment,  under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would  be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where  the act or omission occurred: Provided, That any award, compromise, or  settlement in excess of $25,000 shall be effected only with the prior  written approval of the Attorney General or his designee.</p><p class="depth2">Subject to the provisions of this title relating to civil actions on  tort claims against the United States, any such award, compromise,  settlement, or determination shall be final and conclusive on all  officers of the Government, except when procured by means of fraud.</p><p class="depth2">Any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount of $2,500 or less  made pursuant to this section shall be paid by the head of the Federal  agency concerned out of appropriations available to that agency. Payment  of any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount in excess of $2,500  made pursuant to this section or made by the Attorney General in any  amount pursuant to section 2677 of this title shall be paid in a manner  similar to judgments and compromises in like causes and appropriations  or funds available for the payment of such judgments and compromises are  hereby made available for the payment of awards, compromises, or  settlements under this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">The acceptance by the claimant of any such award, compromise, or  settlement shall be final and conclusive on the claimant, and shall  constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and  against the employee of the Government whose act or omission gave rise  to the claim, by reason of the same subject matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsection (a) of section 2675 of said title 28 provides that:</p><p class="depth2">An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United  States for money damages for injury or death caused by the negligent or  wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting  within the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall  have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his  claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent  by certified or registered mail. The failure of any agency to make final  disposition of a claim within 6 months after it is filed shall, at the  option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of  the claim for purposes of this section. The provisions of this  subsection shall not apply to such claims as may be asserted under the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by third party complaint, cross-claim,  or counter-claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 2678 of said title 28, as amended, provides that no  attorney shall charge fees in excess of 25 percent of a judgment or  settlement after litigation, or in excess of 20 percent of  administrative settlements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subsection (b) of section 2679 of said title 28 provides that  tort remedies against the United States resulting from the operation of  any employee of   the Government of any motor vehicle while acting within the scope of his  employment shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding  against the employee or his estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subsection (b) of section 2401 of said title 28 provides:</p><p class="depth2">A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred  unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency  within 2 years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within  6 months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of  notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was  presented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, shall apply to claims  accruing 6 months or more after date of its enactment (date of  enactment, July 18, 1966).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pursuant to section 2672 of title 28, United States Code, as  amended, the Attorney General has issued regulations (herein referred to  as ``the Regulations''; 28 CFR part 14), prescribing standards and  procedures for settlement of tort claims (31 FR 16616).
