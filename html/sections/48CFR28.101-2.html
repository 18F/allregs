For example, the contracting officer may modify this  provision--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To set a period of time that is other than 10 days for the  return of executed bonds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For use in connection with construction solicitations when the  agency has specified that only separate bid bonds are acceptable in  accordance with 28.101-1(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For use in solicitations for negotiated contracts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For use in service contracts containing options for extended  performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contracting officer shall determine the amount of the bid  guarantee for insertion in the provision at 52.228-1 (see 28.102-2(a)).  The amount shall be adequate to protect the Government from loss should  the successful bidder fail to execute further contractual documents and  bonds as required. The bid guarantee amount shall be at least 20 percent  of the bid price but shall not exceed $3 million. When the penal sum is  expressed as a percentage, a maximum dollar limitation may be stated.
