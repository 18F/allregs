                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notices of requirements. Each person who engages in for-hire air  transportation of passengers must display notices of the requirements  applicable to the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft, and  the penalties for failure to comply with those requirements in  accordance with this section. Each notice must be legible, and be  prominently displayed so it can be seen by passengers in locations where  the aircraft operator issues tickets, checks baggage, and maintains  aircraft boarding areas. At a minimum, each notice must communicate the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard  aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in  five years' imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C.  5124). Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases,  flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and  radioactive materials. Examples: Paints,   lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radio- pharmaceuticals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70  ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage  and certain smoking materials carried on your person. For further  information contact your airline representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ticket purchase. An aircraft operator must ensure that  information on the types of hazardous materials which a passenger is  forbidden to transport aboard an aircraft is presented at the point of  ticket purchase or, if this is not practical, made available in another  manner to passengers prior to the check-in process. Information provided  via the Internet may be in text or pictorial form but must be such that  ticket purchase cannot be completed until the passenger, or a person  acting on their behalf, has been presented with this information and  indicated that they have understood the restrictions on hazardous  materials in baggage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Check-in. When the flight check-in process is conducted remotely  (e.g., via the Internet) or when completed at the airport, without  assistance from another person (e.g., automated check-in kiosk), the  aircraft operator must ensure that information on the types of hazardous  materials a passenger is forbidden to transport aboard an aircraft is  presented to passengers. Information may be in text or in pictorial form  but must be such that the check-in process cannot be completed until the  passenger, or a person acting on their behalf, has been presented with  this information and indicated that they have understood the  restrictions on hazardous materials in baggage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Signage. When the check in process is not conducted remotely  (e.g., at the airport with the assistance of an airline representative),  passenger notification of permitted and forbidden hazardous materials  may be completed through signage (electronic or otherwise), provided it  is legible and prominently displayed.
