An operator shall file an annual prepaid expenses report each year until it has reported the actual use of all the goods and services for which a prepaid expense had been incurred and paid. For purposes of this paragraph, a prepaid expense is an expense for any injectant or fuel used after September 30, 1981, or an expense for any other item to the extent that IRS would allocate the deductions (including depreciation) for that item to the period after September 30, 1981.
