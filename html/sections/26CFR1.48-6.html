                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an estate or trust, the basis of  ``new section 38 property'' and the cost of ``used section 38 property''  placed in service during the taxable year shall be apportioned among the  estate or trust and   its beneficiaries on the basis of the income of such estate or trust  allocable to each. Section 38 property shall not (by reason of such  apportionment) lose its character as new section 38 property or used  section 38 property, as the case may be. The estimated useful life of  such property in the hands of a beneficiary shall be deemed to be the  estimated useful life of such property in the hands of the estate or  trust. The bases of all new section 38 properties which have a useful  life falling within a particular useful life category shall be  aggregated; likewise, the cost of all used section 38 properties which  have a useful life falling within a particular useful life category  shall be aggregated. The total bases of new section 38 properties within  each useful life category and the total cost of used section 38  properties within each useful life category shall be apportioned  separately. The useful life categories are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 3 years or more but less than 5 years; (ii) 5 years or more but  less than 7 years; and (iii) 7 years or more. There shall be apportioned  to the estate or trust for its taxable year, and to each beneficiary of  such estate or trust for his taxable year in which or with which the  taxable year of such estate or trust ends, his share (as determined  under paragraph (b) of this section) of the total bases of new section  38 properties within each useful life category, and his share of the  total cost of used section 38 properties within each useful life  category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total cost of used section 38 property that may be  apportioned among an estate or trust and its beneficiaries for any  taxable year of such estate or trust shall not exceed $50,000. If the  total cost of used section 38 property placed in service during the  taxable year by the estate or trust exceeds $50,000, such estate or  trust must select, under paragraph (c)(4) of Sec.  1.48-3, the used  section 38 property the cost of which is to be apportioned among such  estate or trust and its beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A beneficiary to whom the basis (or cost) of section 38 property  is apportioned shall, for purposes of the credit allowed by section 38,  be treated as the taxpayer with respect to such property. Thus, the  total cost of used section 38 property apportioned to him by the estate  or trust must be taken into account as cost of used section 38 property  in determining whether the $50,000 limitation on the cost of used  property which may be taken into account by the beneficiary in computing  qualified investment for any taxable year is exceeded. If a beneficiary  takes into account in determining his qualified investment any portion  of the basis (or cost) of section 38 property placed in service by an  estate or trust and if such property subsequently is disposed of or  otherwise ceases to be section 38 property in the hands of estate or  trust, such beneficiary shall be subject to the provisions of section  47. See Sec.  1.47-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``beneficiary'' includes  heir, legatee, and devisee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If during the taxable year of an estate or trust a beneficiary's  interest in the income of such estate or trust terminates, the basis (or  cost) of section 38 property placed in service by such estate or trust  after such termination shall not be apportioned to such beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Share. A trust's, estate's, or beneficiary's share of the total  bases of new section 38 properties, and the total cost of used section  38 properties, within a useful life category shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total bases of new (or the total cost of used) section 38  properties which have a useful life falling within such useful life  category placed in service in the taxable year of the estate or trust,  multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of income allocable to such estate or trust or to  such beneficiary for such taxable year, divided by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sum of the amounts of income allocable to such estate or  trust and all its beneficiaries taken into account under subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation based on amount of tax. In the case of an estate or  trust, the $25,000 amount specified in section 46(a)(2), relating to  limitation based on amount of tax, shall be reduced for the taxable year  to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $25,000, multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The qualified investment with respect to the total bases of new  section   38 properties plus the qualified investment with respect to the total  cost of used section 38 properties, apportioned to such estate or trust  under paragraph (a) of this section, divided by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this paragraph, cost of used section  38 property shall not be considered as apportioned to any beneficiary to  the extent that such cost is not taken into account by such beneficiary  in computing qualified investment in used section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Summary statement. An estate or trust shall attach to its return  a statement showing the apportionment to such estate or trust and to  each beneficiary of the total bases of new, and the total cost of used,  section 38 properties within each useful life category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Example.
