Section 7201, as Amended \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ This section originally was section 701(b) (2nd Proviso) of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, July 2, 1964), codified as 5  U.S.C. 7151. Section 7151 was further amended by section 310 of the  Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. This Act also redesignated section  7151 as section 7201, effective January 11, 1979. (Sec. 703(a)(1) of the  Act.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">I. Background Information. A. In 1964 the Congress adopted a basic  anti-discrimination policy for Federal employment, stating:</p><p class="depth2">It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment  opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race,  color, religion, sex or national origin. [5 U.S.C. 7151] \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Ibid. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">In 1978, Congress reaffirmed and amended this policy as part of the  Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Sec. 310 of Pub. L. 95-454], requiring  immediate development of a recruitment program designed to eliminate  underrepresentation of minority groups in specific Federal job  categories. Section 310 directs the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission:</p><p class="depth2">1. To establish Guidelines proposed to be used for a program  designed to eliminate such underrepresentation;</p><p class="depth2">2. To make, in consultation with OPM, initial determinations of  underrepresentation which are proposed to be used in this program; and</p><p class="depth2">3. To transmit the determinations made under (2) above to the  Executive Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management and the Congress,  within 60 days of enactment.</p><p class="depth2">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \3\ is directed by this  amendment: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ This Office was created by Reorganization Plan No. 2, issued  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.

To provide continuing assistance to Federal agencies in carrying  out such programs;</p><p class="depth2">3. To conduct a continuing program of evaluation and oversight to  determine the effectiveness of such programs;</p><p class="depth2">4.

To report annually to the Congress on this program, not later  than January 31 of each year.</p><p class="depth2">Congress further directed that the recruitment program must be  administered consistent with provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of  1978. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ Conference Report on Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, No. 95- 1272, p. 145. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">B. In framing these Guidelines and making its initial determinations  of underrepresentation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (Commission) is acting pursuant to its obligations and authority under 5  U.S.C. 7201, as amended; Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, as amended; Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 (issued  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) and Executive Order 12067, issued  under this Plan (43 FR 28967, June 30, 1978). This Commission must  develop and/or ensure the development of uniform, coherent and effective  standards for administration and enforcement of all Federal anti- discrimination and equal employment opportunity laws, policies and  programs, and to ensure the elimination of duplication and inconsistency  in such programs.</p><p class="depth2">C. A review of the legislative history of Federal equal employment  opportunity policy provides further guidance on the scope and nature of  determinations and guidelines to be issued for this program.</p><p class="depth2">The basic policy statement on Federal equal employment policy  enacted by the Congress in 1964 (5 U.S.C. 7151, redesignated as section  7201) gave the President authority for implementation. Executive Order  11246 (1966), expanded and superseded by Executive Order 11478 (1969)  with respect to Federal employment, required Federal agencies to develop  affirmative action programs designed to eliminate discrimination and  assure equal employment opportunity.</p><p class="depth2">In 1972, Congress found that serious discrimination persisted in  Federal employment. It found that minorities and women were  significantly absent at higher levels in Federal employment, and  severely underrepresented in some Federal agencies and in some  geographic areas where they constituted significant proportions of the  population. After a detailed review of Federal employment practices and  statistics, the Congress concluded that:</p><p class="depth2">The disproportionate distribution of minorities and women throughout  the Federal bureaucracy and their exclusion from higher level policy- making and supervisory positions indicates the government's failure to  pursue its policy of equal employment opportunity. \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\5\ Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of  1972, p. 83. See pp. 82-86 and 421-425 for Congressional Findings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Congress found that this exclusion resulted from overt and  ``systemic'' discriminatory practices.</p><p class="depth2">These findings, among others, led Congress to extend title VII  coverage to Federal employment in Section 717 of the Equal Employment  Opportunity Act of 1972.</p><p class="depth2">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 clearly states, for the first  time, that ``it is the policy of the United States * * * to provide * *  * a Federal workforce reflective of the Nation's diversity * * *'' \6\  The Act establishes in law as the first merit principle that recruitment  should be designed to achieve a Federal workforce from ``all segments of  society.'' Among the personnel practices prohibited by the Act is  discrimination prohibited under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964, as amended. \7\ Therefore, the Civil Service Reform Act and its  directive for a special recruitment program clearly unite requirements  for basic Federal personnel policy with requirements for Federal equal  employment policy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\6\ Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Section 3.</p><p class="depth2">\7\ Section 101(a) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1) and  2302(b)(1)(A), as amended. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">It is clear from the legislative history of Federal equal employment  policy that the legal standards of title VII must be applied to Federal  employment. Thus, guidelines for a recruitment program designed to  eliminate underrepresentation in Federal agency employment must be  developed consistent with the framework of affirmative action programs.</p><p class="depth2">D. Guided by the review of the legislative history, and the  responsibilities and authorities cited in I(B) of this appendix, the  Commission is issuing these Guidelines to provide a framework for  development of recruitment program regulations by OPM. The Commission  may later provide more detailed guidance, through consultation with OPM,  designed to achieve an overall Federal equal employment program which is  consistent with, and which effectively implements title VII  requirements.</p><p class="depth2">II. Initial Determinations of Underrepresentation. A. Pursuant to  Section 7201, underrepresentation exists when the percentages of  minority and female Federal employees in   specific grades are less than their percentages in the civilian labor  force. ``Minority'' refers only to those groups classified as  ``minority'' for the purpose of data collection by the Commission and  OPM in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The  civilian labor force includes all persons 16 years of age and over  except the armed forces, who are employed or seeking employment. Such a  determination of underrepresentation is designated in these Guidelines  as ``below the Section 7201 level''.</p><p class="depth2">B. The Commission has examined existing data on Federal employment  and the civilian labor force and has made initial determinations of  underrepresentation of groups by race, national origin and sex in  specific grades of the major Federal pay systems, under the legal  authorities cited in I(B), of this appendix.</p><p class="depth2">C. The Table which follows shows the grades at which the percentage  of each group in the Federal workforce falls below its percentage in the  civilian labor force. The table covers four major Federal pay systems  which account for more than 95 percent of Federal employees, excluding  the Postal Service. \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\8\ The initial determinations are based on data for only those  agencies covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Commission  will make subsequent determinations on other agencies covered by title  VII, e.g. the U.S. Postal Service, TVA, Central Intelligence Agency,  Federal Reserve Board.</p><p class="depth2">Civilian Labor Force and Federal Employment Grades at Which Minorities and Women Are Below the 7201 Level, by</p><p class="depth2">Selected Pay Systems, and by Sex, Race, and National Origin--1977 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Percent of                        Grades Below the 7201 Level</p><p class="depth2">Civilian  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Sex/Race/National Origin       Labor      Gen Sched and      Non-spvsry      Leader Regular    Spvsry Regular</p><p class="depth2">Force       Equivalent       Regular Wage          Wage              Wage ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of Grades............  ..........                18                15                15                19 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Women.......................        41.0                9+                2+                2+               All White.......................        34.0                9+               All               All               All Black.......................         4.6               11+                5+                5+                5+ Hispanic....................         1.7                6+               All             2, 4+               All AsAm/PacIs..................          .6            1, 10+                2+                2+               All AmIn/AlNa...................          .1               13+                9+       1, 5, 6, 9+         4, 9, 11+ Minority Men................         8.9                3+               13+           11, 14+               13+ Black.......................         5.3             4, 6+               12+               11+               11+ Hispanic....................         2.8               All               14+             1, 15        13-15, 17+ AsAm/PacIs..................          .7      1-8, 10, 16+            9, 14+   1, 3, 8, 9, 12+   1, 3, 8, 9, 17+ AmIn/AlNa...................          .2              None                14            1, 13+               17+ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes. 1.

Information on grades below 7201 level based on Office of Personnel Management data from Equal Employment</p><p class="depth2">Opportunity Statistics, November 20, 1977 (publication in process).</p><p class="depth2">D. The initial determinations of underrepresentation were based upon  average 1977 labor force data from the Current Population Survey  published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Employment and Earnings,  January 1978), and 1977 Federal workforce statistics from Equal  Employment Opportunity Statistics (publication in process).</p><p class="depth2">The labor force figures are published annually; the Federal  employment statistics semiannually. These measures, and any  modifications agreed upon by the Commission and OPM, will be updated  annually.</p><p class="depth2">Regional and area Federal employment statistics are available from  the Office of Personnel Management. The latest reliable local labor  force data by race, national origin, and sex is from the 1970 Census.  The Commission and OPM will consult on appropriate labor force measures  to be used for local analyses.</p><p class="depth2">E. These initial determinations are based upon a preliminary  analysis of the data, and may be further refined by the Commission, in  consultation with OPM, to include geographic and occupational  underrepresentation. It is further recognized that for the purpose of  developing regulations, the OPM, in consultation with the Commission,  will undertake more specific analyses of data use and applicability  necessary to develop programs for the Federal agencies pursuant to  Section 7201(a)(2)(C). The OPM may establish criteria for grouping  agencies, for treating   agency components separately and for grouping grades and pay systems. In  addition, OPM may study other available data sources and use other  techniques to assure statistically significant findings of  underrepresentation. Based upon these studies, OPM may make  recommendations to the Commission for future determinations of  underrepresentation.</p><p class="depth2">III. Procedures for Developing Recruitment Programs. A. The program  developed and implemented by OPM under Section 7201 should be designed  to result in applicant pools with sufficient qualified members of  underrepresented groups. Where the supply of such groups initially  appears to be low for specific occupational, professional and other  groupings, the program should be designed so that recruitment efforts  stimulate interest of underrepresented groups in those occupations where  there are realistic projections of Federal employment opportunities.</p><p class="depth2">B. In establishing groupings for determining underrepresentation,  OPM should utilize broad occupational categories to the extent possible.</p><p class="depth2">C. The Commission recognizes that OPM's regulations should allow  flexibility in development and design of each Federal agency's  recruitment program. However, all statistical comparisons must be  computed in a manner consistent with the method utilized in II C of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth2">The Commission recommends that each agency program meet several  minimum requirements. The program should be based on a determination of  underrepresentation in the agency's total workforce, in appropriate  geographic components; by grade; by broad occupational, professional and  other groupings in comparison to the national civilian labor force,  according to the criteria developed by OPM under these guidelines.</p><p class="depth2">Where an agency or major component thereof (such as Headquarters and  Regional Offices) is located in a geographic area where the percentage  of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is higher  than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or  appropriate component should conduct its recruitment program for that  component on the basis of the higher level of representation in the  relevant civilian labor force.</p><p class="depth2">Where an agency or major component thereof is located in a  geographic area where participation of a particular underrepresented  group in the area labor force is significantly lower than their  participation in the national labor force, such agency or component may,  in consultation with OPM, utilize the lower applicable civilian labor  force percentage in determining underrepresentation for the component.  In no event, however, may the agency utilize a figure lower than the  regional or nationwide Section 7201 level for positions where  recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible. Factors such  as size of the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay  scale may be considered to set goals and to justify a recruitment  program focused on various job categories.</p><p class="depth2">IV. Scope of Actions Covered by This Program. A. ``Recruitment''  under this program is defined as the total process by which the Federal  Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the  employment of qualified or qualifiable applicants from underrepresented  groups for job openings in grades and in occupational categories where  underrepresentation has been determined. This process should include  innovative internal, as well as targeted external, recruitment actions.</p><p class="depth2">B. Prior to developing regulations, the Office should review data on  personnel actions and other information, to identify those job  categories for which internal recruitment and external recruitment is  most appropriate and feasible, and to provide guidance to the Federal  agencies for targeting their recruitment programs, based on this  information. OPM should advise all agencies that all job qualifications,  personnel procedures and criteria must be consistent with the Uniform  Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (43 FR 38290 August 25,  1978) OPM should consider the following in providing guidance to  agencies:</p><p class="depth2">1. External Recruitment Programs. a. Such programs should focus on  grade levels and/or job categories where underrepresentation has been  identified and where external recruitment realistically will result in  hiring opportunities.</p><p class="depth2">Recruitment programs also should include a review of job functions  to determine those jobs that may be better performed by persons who are  bicultural and who have bilingual capabilities, and those jobs that can  be performed by persons not fluent in English.</p><p class="depth2">b. Where eligibility lists are used for filling jobs, it is  recommended that the regulations require, an analysis by race, national  origin and sex, to determine whether the list contains sufficient  candidates from groups underrepresented in those jobs. OPM should  require that where the list does not have such representation, expanded  recruitment procedures be designed to assure that members of  underrepresented groups qualified to perform the job(s) are included in  the pool of applicants from which the selecting official makes the  selection. Such expanded recruitment procedures may include additional  external recruitment or various actions (such as described in 2. below)  to reach members of these groups within the Federal workforce who are  qualified or qualifiable for these jobs.</p><p class="depth2">2. Internal Recruitment Programs. a. Internal recruitment programs  should be designed by agencies to identify currently qualified or   qualifiable persons for job categories and series where  underrepresentation prevails, according to the national determinations  and the determinations made by each agency under these guidelines.</p><p class="depth2">b. Further, OPM should work with Federal agencies to develop  effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job  opportunities, targeted to reach Federal employees from underrepresented  groups in all agencies in order to broaden the applicant pool.</p><p class="depth2">V. Consistency with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. A. The Office  shall develop regulations and implement this program in consultation  with the Commission and with other affected agencies in such manner that  their recruitment programs may be incorporated as a consistent and  effective element of the agencies' national and regional equal  employment opportunity plans. Each agency is required to implement such  plans under the direction and guidance of the Commission in accordance  with Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as  amended, and Executive Order 12067.</p><p class="depth2">B. Procedures shall be established by OPM and the Commission to  assure appropriate consultation in development of the regulations.</p><p class="depth2">C. Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 and to Executive Order  12067 issued thereunder, the Commission will establish procedures to  provide appropriate consultation and review of the program on a  continuing basis, to maximize its effectiveness and eliminate any  duplication, conflict or inconsistency in requirements for equal  opportunity programs in the Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth2">D. In preparing its annual report to the Congress pursuant to the  Act, OPM should do so in consultation with the Commission.  [44 FR 22031, Apr. 13, 1979; 44 FR 76747, Dec. 28, 1979]</p>
