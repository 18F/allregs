                            <p class="depth0">No person may operate an aircraft under this part that is registered in the United States unless it is equipped with an approved cockpit voice recorder that meets the standards of TSO-C123a, or later revision. The cockpit voice recorder must record the information that would be required to be

recorded if the aircraft were operated under part 121, 125, or 135 of this chapter, and must be installed by the compliance times required by that part, as applicable to the aircraft.
