Sec. 3802.1-3  Operations existing on October 21, 1976.</p><p class="depth0">A plan of operations shall not be required for operations that were being conducted on October 21, 1976, unless the operation is undergoing changes that exceed the manner and degree of operations on October 21, 1976. However, if the authorized officer determines that operations in the same manner and degree are causing undue or unnecessary degradation of lands and resources or adverse environmental effects, an approved plan containing protective measures may be required. Any changes planned in an existing operation that would result in operations exceeding the present manner and degree shall be delayed until the plan is processed under provisions of Sec. 3802.1-5 of this title.


Sec. 3802.1-4  Contents of plan of operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A plan of operations shall be filed in the District Office of the Bureau of Land Management in which the claim is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No special form is required to file a plan of operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The plan of operations shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name and mailing address of both the person for whom the operation will be conducted, and the person who will be in charge of the operation and should be contacted concerning the reclamation or other aspects of the operation (any change in the mailing address shall be reported promptly to the authorized officer);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A map, preferably a topographic map, or sketch showing present road, bridge or aircraft landing area locations, proposed road, bridge or aircraft landing area locations, and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information sufficient to describe either the entire operation proposed or reasonably foreseeable operations and how they would be conducted, including the nature and location of proposed structures and facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The type and condition of existing and proposed means of access or aircraft landing areas, the means of transportation used or to be used, and the

estimated period during which the proposed activity will take place;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If and when applicable, the serial number assigned to the mining claim, mill or tunnel site filed pursuant to subpart 3833 of this title.


Sec. 3802.1-5  Plan approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The authorized officer shall promptly aknowledge the receipt of a plan of operations and within 30 days of receipt of the plan act on the plan of operations to determine its acceptability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The authorized officer shall review the plan of operations to determine if the operations are impairing the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness. Pending approval of the plan of operations, mining operations may continue in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts as prescribed in Sec. 3802.3 of this title. After completing the review of the plan of operations, the authorized officer shall give the operator written notice that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan is approved subject to measures that will prevent the impairment of the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness as determined by the authorized officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plans covering operations on a claim with a valid existing right are approved subject to measures that will prevent undue and unnecessary degradation of the area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated impacts of the mining operations are such that all or part of further operations will impair the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness, the plan is disapproved and continuance of such operations is not allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of a plan of operations for mining activities commencing after the effective date of these regulations, the authorized officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In an area of lands under wilderness review where an inventory has not been completed, an operator may agree to operate under a plan of operations that includes terms and conditions that would be applicable in a wilderness study area. Without an agreement to this effect, no action may be taken on the plan until a wilderness inventory is completed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The area has been inventoried and a final decision has been issued and become effective that the area does not contain wilderness characteristics, and that the mining operations are no longer subject to these regulations; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated impacts are such that all or part of the proposed mining operations will impair the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness, and therefore, the proposed mining operation cannot be allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In addition to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the following general plan approval procedures may also apply. The authorized officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan of operations is unacceptable and the reasons therefore;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Modification of the plan of operations is necessary to meet the requirements of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan of operations is being reviewed, but that more time, not to exceed an additional 60 days, is necessary to complete such review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is needed except in those instances where it is determined that an Environmental Impact Statement, compliance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is needed. Periods during which the area of operations is inaccessible for inspection due to climatic conditions, fire hazards or other physical conditions or legal impediments, shall not be included when counting the 60 calendar day period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The proposed operations do not require a plan of operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the authorized officer does not notify the operator of any action on the plan of operations within the 30-day period, or the 60-day extension, or notify the operator of the need for an Environmental Impact Statement or compliance with section 106 of NHPA or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, operations under the plan may begin. The option to begin operations under this section does not constitute approval of a plan of operations. However, if the authorized officer at a later date finds that operations under the

plan are impairing wilderness suitability, the authorized officer shall notify the operator that the operations are not in compliance with these regulations and what changes are needed, and shall require the operator to submit a modified plan of operations, within a time specified in the notice. If the operator is notified of the need for an Environmental Impact Statement, the plan of operations shall not be approved before 30 days after a final statement is prepared and filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. If the is operator notified of the need for compliance with section 106 of the NHPA or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, the plan of operations shall not be approved until the compliance responsibilities of the Bureau of Land Management are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If cultural resource properties listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places are within the area of operations, no operations which would affect those resources shall be approved until compliance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act is accomplished. The operator is not required to do or to pay for an inventory. The responsibility and cost of the cultural resource mitigation, except as provided in Sec. 3802.3-2(f) of this title, included in an approved plan of operation shall be the operator's.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized officer may approve any operations that may be necessary for timely compliance with requirements of Federal and State laws. Such operations shall be conducted so as to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability and to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by the authorized officer in accordance with the standards contained in Sec. 3802.3 of this title.


Sec. 3802.1-6  Modification of plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth this proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time. Thereafter, the operator shall file a supplemental plan or plans prior to undertaking any operations not covered by the initial plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> At any time during operations under an approved plan of operations, the authorized officer or the operator may initiate a modification of the plan detailing any necessary changes that were unforeseen at the time of filing of the plan of operations. If the operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time considered reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to the State Director that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, except in the case of a modification under Sec. 3802.1-5(e) of this title, the State Director shall determine (1) whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations; (2) whether the disturbance is or may become of such significance as to require modification of the plan of operations in order to meet the requirement for environmental protection specified in Sec. 3802.3-2 of this title, and (3) whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. Lacking such a determination by the State Director, an operator is not required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan of operations until a modified plan is approved, unless the State Director determines that the operations are causing impairment or unnecessary or undue degradation to surface resources. He shall advise the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage and the operator shall immediately take all necessary steps to implement measures recommended by the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A supplemental plan of operations or a modification of an approved plan of operations shall be approved by the authorized officer in the same manner as the initial plan of operations.


Sec. 3802.1-7  Existing operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Persons conducting mining operations on the effective date of these regulations, who would be required to

submit a plan of operations under Sec. 3802.1-1 of this title, may continue operations but shall, within 60 days after the effective date of these regulations, submit a plan of operations. Upon a showing of good cause, the authorized officer shall grant an extension of time to submit a plan of operations not to exceed an additional 180 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operations may continue according to the submitted plan of operations during its review unless the operator is notified otherwise by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Upon approval of a plan of operations, mining operations shall be conducted in accordance with the approved plan.</p>
