Vocational vehicles and  tractor chassis are modeled using the following inputs in the GEM model.  All seven of the following inputs apply for sleeper cab tractors, while  some do not apply for vocational vehicles and other tractor regulatory  subcategories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of vehicles using regulatory subcategories (such  as ``Class 8 Combination--Sleeper Cab--High Roof'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Coefficient of aerodynamic drag in accordance with 40 CFR  1037.520 and 1037.521.

Equivalent fuel consumption FELs are derived in GEM from the  CO2 FEL value rounded to the nearest whole number and are  expressed to the nearest 0.1 gallons per 1000 ton-mile. For families  containing multiple subfamilies, identify the FELs for each subfamily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section address vocational  vehicle and tractor chassis testing only. Engine performance and the  advanced technologies equipped on vocational vehicles and tractors are  tested separately as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vocational vehicle and tractor engine test results for  conventional and alternative fueled vehicles are determined in  accordance with Sec. 535.6(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Improvements for advanced technologies are determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Test hybrid vehicles with power take-off in accordance with 40  CFR 1037.525 and vehicles with post-transmission hybrid systems in  accordance with 40 CFR 1037.550.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> All electric vehicles are deemed to have zero CO2  emissions and fuel consumption.

The  manufacturer may assign the numbers and configurations of engines within  the respective subfamilies at any time prior to the submission of the  end-of-year report required by 40 CFR 1036.730 and Sec. 535.8. The  manufacturer must track into which type of vehicle each engine is  installed, although EPA may allow the manufacturer to use statistical  methods to determine this for a fraction of its engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following engines are excluded from the engine families  used to determined FCL values and the benefit for these engines is  determined as an advanced technology credits under the ABT provisions  provided in Sec. 535.7(e):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Engines certified as hybrid engines or power packs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Engines certified as hybrid engines designed with PTO capability  and that are sold with the engine coupled to a transmission.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engines with Rankine cycle waste heat recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculate equivalent fuel consumption values for emissions FCLs  and the CO2 levels for certified engines, in gallons per 100  bhp-hr and round each fuel consumption value to the nearest 0.01 gallon  per 100 bhp-hr.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate equivalent fuel consumption FCL values for  compression-ignition engines and alternative fuel compression-ignition  engines. CO2 FCL value (grams per bhp-hr)/10,180 grams per  gallon of diesel fuel) x (10 \2\) = Fuel consumption FCL value (gallons  per 100 bhp-hr).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate equivalent fuel consumption FCL values for spark- ignition engines and alternative fuel spark-ignition engines.
