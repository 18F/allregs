                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this part is to implement title I of the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the ADA Amendments  Act of 2008 (ADAAA or Amendments Act), 42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq.,  requiring equal employment opportunities for individuals with  disabilities. The ADA as amended, and these regulations, are intended to  provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination  of discrimination against individuals with disabilities, and to provide  clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing  discrimination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in  this part, this part does not apply a lesser standard than the standards  applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 790- 794a, as amended), or the regulations issued by Federal agencies  pursuant to that title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relationship to other laws. This part does not invalidate or  limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any Federal law or law of  any State or political subdivision of any State or jurisdiction that  provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with  disabilities than is afforded by this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State workers' compensation laws and disability benefit  programs. Nothing in this part alters the standards for determining  eligibility for benefits under State workers' compensation laws or under  State and Federal disability benefit programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Broad coverage. The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it  easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA.  Consistent with the Amendments Act's purpose of reinstating a broad  scope of protection under the ADA, the definition of ``disability'' in  this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to  the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. The primary object  of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered  entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination  has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of  disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition  of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.  [76 FR 16999, Mar. 25, 2011]</p>
