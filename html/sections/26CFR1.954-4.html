                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Items included. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section, foreign base company services income means income of a  controlled foreign corporation, whether in the form of compensation,  commissions, fees, or otherwise, derived in connection with the  performance of technical, managerial, engineering, architectural,  scientific, skilled, industrial, commercial, or like services which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 1.954-1, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Are performed outside the country under the laws of which the  controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Services performed for, or on behalf of, a related person--(1)  Specific cases. For purposes of paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section,  ``services which are performed for, or on behalf of, a related person''  include (but are not limited to) services performed by a controlled  foreign corporation in a case where--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The controlled foreign corporation is paid or reimbursed by, is  released from an obligation to, or otherwise receives substantial  financial benefit from, a related person for performing such services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The controlled foreign corporation performs services (whether  or not with respect to property sold by a related person) which a  related person is, or has been, obligated to perform;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The controlled foreign corporation performs services with  respect to property sold by a related person and the performance of such  services constitutes a condition or a material term of such sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Substantial assistance contributing to the performance of such  services has been furnished by a related person or persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Guaranty of performance. Subparagraph (1)(ii)  of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to services performed by  a controlled foreign corporation pursuant to a contract the performance  of which is guaranteed by a related person, if (a) the related person's  sole obligation with respect to the contract is to guarantee performance  of such services, (b) the controlled foreign corporation is fully  obligated to perform the services under the contract, and (c) the  related person (or any other person related to the controlled foreign  corporation) does not in fact (1) pay for performance of, or perform,  any of such services the performance of which is so guaranteed or (2)  pay for performance of, or perform, any significant services related to  such services. If the related person (or any other person related to the  controlled foreign corporation) does in fact pay for performance of, or  perform, any of such services or any significant services related to  such services, subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall apply with  respect to the services performed by the controlled foreign corporation  pursuant to the contract the performance of which is guaranteed by the  related person, even though such payment or performance is not  considered to be substantial assistance for purposes of subparagraph  (1)(iv) of this paragraph. For purposes of this subdivision, a related  person shall be considered to guarantee performance of the services by  the controlled foreign corporation whether it guarantees performance of  such services by a separate contract of guaranty or enters into a  service contract solely for purposes of guaranteeing performance of such  services and immediately thereafter assigns the entire contract to the  controlled foreign corporation for execution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of substantial assistance test. For purposes of  subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assistance furnished by a related person or persons to the  controlled foreign corporation shall include, but shall not be limited  to, direction, supervision, services, know-how, financial assistance  (other than contributions to capital), and equipment, material, or  supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>, shall  be determined after taking into account adjustments, if any, made under  section 482.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, determinations shall be made after  taking into account adjustments, if any, made under section 482 and the  term ``consideration actually paid'' shall include any amount which is  deemed paid by the controlled foreign corporation pursuant to such an  adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Even though assistance furnished by a related person or persons  to a controlled foreign corporation in the form of direction,  supervision, services, or know-how is not considered to be substantial  under (b) of this subdivision and assistance furnished by a related  person or persons in the form of financial assistance (other than  contributions to capital), equipment, material, or supplies is not  considered to be substantial under (c) of this subdivision, such  assistance may nevertheless constitute substantial assistance when taken  together or in combination with other assistance furnished by a related  person or persons which in itself is not considered to be substantial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assistance furnished by a related person or persons to a  controlled foreign corporation in the form of direction, supervision,  services, or know-how shall not be taken into account under (b) or (d)  of this subdivision unless the assistance so furnished assists the  controlled foreign corporation directly in the performance of the  services performed by such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies to taxable years of a  controlled foreign corporation beginning on or after July 23, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A is paid by related  corporation M for the installation and maintenance of industrial  machines which M Corporation manufactures and sells to B Corporation.  Such installation and maintenance services by A Corporation are  performed for, or on behalf of, M Corporation for purposes of section  954(e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation B enters into a contract  with an unrelated person to drill an oil well in a foreign country.  Domestic corporation M owns all the outstanding stock of B Corporation.  Corporation B employs a relatively small clerical and administrative  staff and owns the necessary well-drilling equipment. Most of the  technical and supervisory personnel who oversee the drilling of the oil  well by B Corporation are regular employees of M Corporation who are  temporarily employed by B Corporation. In addition, B Corporation hires  on the open market unskilled and semiskilled laborers to work on the  drilling project. The services performed by B Corporation under the  well-drilling contract are performed for, or on behalf of, a related  person for purposes of section 954(e) because the services of the  technical and supervisory personnel which are provided by M Corporation  are of substantial assistance in the performance of such contract in  that they assist B Corporation directly in the execution of the contract  and provide B Corporation with skills which are a principal element in  producing the income from the performance of such contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation F enters into a contract  with an unrelated person to construct a dam in a foreign country.  Domestic corporation M owns all the outstanding stock of F Corporation.  Corporation F leases or buys from M Corporation, on an arm's length  basis, the equipment and material necessary for the construction of the  dam. The technical and supervisory personnel who design and oversee the  construction of the dam are regular full-time employees of F Corporation  who are not on loan from any related person. The principal clerical  work, and the financial accounting, required in connection with the  construction of the dam by F Corporation are performed, on a remunerated  basis, by full-time employees of M Corporation. All other assistance F  Corporation requires in completing the construction of the dam is paid  for by that corporation and furnished by unrelated persons. The services  performed by F Corporation under the contract for the construction of  the dam are not performed for, or on behalf of, a related person for  purposes of section 954(e) because the clerical and accounting services  furnished by M Corporation do not assist F Corporation directly in the  performance of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation D, a wholly owned  subsidiary of domestic corporation M, procures and enters a contract  with an unrelated person to construct a superhighway in a foreign  country, but such person enters the contract only on the   condition that M Corporation agrees to perform, or to pay for the  performance by some person other than D Corporation of, the services  called for by the contract if D Corporation should fail to complete  their performance. Corporation D is capable of performing such contract.  No related person as to D Corporation pays for, or performs, any  services called for by the contract, or pays for, or performs, any  significant services related to such services. The construction of the  superhighway by D Corporation is not considered for purposes of section  954(e) to be the performance of services for, or on behalf of M  Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Domestic corporation M is obligated under a contract with  an unrelated person to construct a superhighway in a foreign country. At  a later date M Corporation assigns the entire contract to its wholly  owned subsidiary, controlled foreign corporation C, and the unrelated  person releases M Corporation from any obligation under the contract.  The construction of such highway by C Corporation is considered for  purposes of section 954(e) to be the performance of services for, or on  behalf of, M Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Domestic corporation M enters a contract with an  unrelated person to construct a superhighway in a foreign country.  Corporation M immediately assigns the entire contract to its wholly  owned subsidiary, controlled foreign corporation C. The unrelated person  does not release M Corporation of its obligation under the contract, the  sole purpose of these arrangements being to have M Corporation guarantee  performance of the contract by C Corporation. Corporation C is capable  of performing the construction contract. Neither M Corporation nor any  other person related to C Corporation pays for, or performs, any  services called for by the construction contract or at any time pays  for, or performs, any significant services related to the services  performed under such contract. The construction of the superhighway by C  Corporation is not considered for purposes of section 954(e) to be the  performance of services for, or on behalf of, M Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in example 6 except that M  Corporation, preparatory to entering the construction contract, prepares  plans and specifications which enable the submission of bids for the  contract. Since M Corporation has performed significant services related  to the services the performance of which it has guaranteed, the  construction of such highway by C Corporation is considered for purposes  of section 954(e) to be the performance of services for, or on behalf  of, M Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Domestic corporation M manufactures an industrial machine  which requires specialized installation. Corporation M sells the  machines for a basic price if the contract of sale contains no provision  for installation. If, however, the customer agrees to employ controlled  foreign corporation E, a wholly owned subsidiary of M Corporation, to  install the machine and to pay E Corporation a specified installation  charge, M Corporation sells the machine at a price which is less than  the basic price. The installation services performed by E Corporation  for customers of M Corporation purchasing the machine at the reduced  price are considered for purposes of section 954(e) to be performed for,  or on behalf of, M Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Domestic corporation M manufactures and sells industrial  machines with a warranty as to their performance conditional upon their  installation and maintenance by a factory-authorized service agency.  Controlled foreign corporation F, a wholly owned subsidiary of M  Corporation, is the only authorized service agency. Any installation or  maintenance services performed by F Corporation on such machines are  considered for purposes of section 954(e) to be performed for, or on  behalf of, M Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Domestic corporation M manufactures electric office  machines which it sells at a basic price without any provision for, or  understanding as to, adjustment or maintenance of the machines. The  machines require constant adjustment and maintenance services which M  Corporation, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of M Corporation, and  certain unrelated persons throughout the world are qualified to perform.  From among the numerous persons qualified and available to perform  adjustment and maintenance services with respect to such office  machines, foreign corporation B, a customer of M Corporation, employs  controlled foreign corporation G, a wholly owned subsidiary of M  Corporation, to adjust and maintain the office machines which B  Corporation purchases from M Corporation. The adjustment and maintenance  services performed by G Corporation for B Corporation are not considered  for purposes of section 954(e) to be performed for, or on behalf of, M  Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Place where services are performed. The place where services  will be considered to have been performed for purposes of paragraph  (a)(2) of this section will depend on the facts and circumstances of  each case. As a general rule, services will be considered performed  where the persons performing services for the controlled foreign  corporation which derives income in connection with the performance of  technical, managerial, architectural, engineering, scientific, skilled,  industrial, commercial, or like services are physically located when  they perform their duties in the execution of the service   activity resulting in such income. Therefore, in many cases, total gross  income of a controlled foreign corporation derived in connection with  each service contract or arrangement performed for or on behalf of a  related person must be apportioned, between income which is not foreign  base company services income and that which is foreign base company  services income, on a basis of employee-time spent within the foreign  country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is  created or organized and employee-time spent without the foreign country  under the laws of which such corporation is created or organized. In  allocating time spent within and without the foreign country under the  laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or  organized, relative weight must also be given to the value of the  various functions performed by persons in fulfillment of the service  contract or arrangement. For example, clerical work will ordinarily be  assigned little value, while services performed by technical, highly  skilled, and managerial personnel will be assigned greater values in  relation to the type of function performed by each individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Items excluded. Foreign base company services income does not  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income derived in connection with the performance of services by  a controlled foreign corporation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The services directly relate to the sale or exchange of personal  property by the controlled foreign corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The property sold or exchanged was manufactured, produced,  grown, or extracted by such controlled foreign corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The services were performed before the sale or exchange of  such property by the controlled foreign corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income derived in connection with the performance of services by  a controlled foreign corporation if the services directly relate to an  offer or effort to sell or exchange personal property which was, or  would have been, manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted by such  controlled foreign corporation whether or not a sale or exchange of such  property was in fact consummated; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, foreign  base company shipping income (as determined under Sec. 1.954-6).  [T.D. 6734, 29 FR 6399, May 15, 1964, as amended by T.D. 6981, 33 FR  16497, Nov. 13, 1968; T.D. 7893, 48 FR 22523, May 19, 1983; T.D. 9008,  67 FR 48025, July 23, 2002]</p>
