These exclusions may be applied on a statewide basis or selectively by coverage groups. They are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Services in any class or classes of elective positions;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services in any class or classes of part-time positions;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Services in any class or classes of positions where the pay is on a fee basis;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any agricultural labor or student services which would also be excluded if performed for a private employer; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For modifications executed after 1994, services performed by election officials or election workers if the payments for those services in a calendar year are less than $1000 for calendar years after 1994 and before 2000, or, for calendar years after 1999, are less than the $1000 base amount as adjusted pursuant to section 218(c)(8)(B) of the Act to reflect changes in wages in the economy. We will publish this adjustment of the $1000 base amount in the Federal Register on or before November 1 preceding the year for which the adjustment is made.
