                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> May FNS recover and redistribute caseload and administrative funds assigned to a State agency? Yes. FNS may recover and redistribute caseload and administrative funds assigned to a State agency during the fiscal year. FNS will redistribute these resources to other State agencies in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 247.21(a) and 247.22(b). In reassigning caseload, FNS will use the most up-to-date data on participation and the extent to which caseload is being utilized, as well as other information provided by State agencies. In accordance with Sec. 247.21(a)(2), in instances in which FNS recovers caseload slots, the State agency must use 95 percent of its original caseload allocation to be eligible for additional caseload. However, the State agency must not exceed its reduced caseload allocation on an average monthly basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Is there a limit on the amount of caseload slots or administrative funds that FNS may recover? Yes. FNS will not unilaterally recover caseload that would result in the recovery of more than 50 percent of the State's administrative funds. However, in instances in which the State agency requests that FNS recover any portion of its assigned caseload, the 50-percent limitation will not apply.</p>
