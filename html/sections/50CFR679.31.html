See  Sec. 679.20 (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Halibut CDQ reserve--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NMFS will annually withhold from the  IFQ allocation the proportions of the halibut catch limit that are  specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for use as a CDQ  reserve.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proportions of the halibut catch limit annually withheld  for the halibut CDQ program, exclusive of issued QS, are as follows for  each IPHC regulatory area (see Figure 15 to this part):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Area 4B. In IPHC regulatory area 4B, 20 percent of the annual  halibut quota shall be apportioned to a CDQ reserve.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Area 4C. In IPHC regulatory area 4C, 50 percent of the annual  halibut quota shall be apportioned to a CDQ reserve.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Area 4D.

In IPHC regulatory area 4E, 100 percent of the annual  halibut quota shall be apportioned to a CDQ reserve. A fishing trip  limit of 10,000 lb (4.54 mt) applies to halibut CDQ harvested through  September 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Crab CDQ reserves. Crab CDQ reserves for crab species governed  by the Crab Rationalization Program are specified at Sec. 680.40(a)(1)  of this chapter. For Norton Sound red king crab, 7.5 percent of the  guideline harvest level specified by the State of Alaska is allocated to  the crab CDQ reserve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)(A).)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> CDQ ABC reserves. (See Sec. 679.20(b)(1)(iii)(A))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(ii)</em> shall be  allocated among the CDQ groups based on the CDQ percentage allocations  required under 16 U.S.C. 1855(i)(1)(C), unless modified under 16 U.S.C.  1855(i)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(H)</em>. A portion of the groundfish CDQ reserves will be  allocated according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual allocations of nontarget groundfish species among the CDQ  groups. Seven-tenths of one percent of   each of the annual TACs allocated as groundfish CDQ reserves under Sec.  679.20(b)(1)(ii)(C) and (D), with the exception of the trawl gear  sablefish CDQ reserves, shall be allocated among the CDQ groups by the  panel established in section 305(i)(1)(G) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual allocations of PSQ reserves among the CDQ groups. The  annual PSQ reserves shall be allocated among the CDQ groups based on the  percentage allocations approved by NMFS on August 8, 2005. These  percentage allocations are described and listed in a notice published in  the Federal Register on August 31, 2006 (71 FR 51804).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Annual allocations of CDQ ABC reserves among the CDQ groups. (i)  An amount equivalent to 10 percent of the ABC reserve for flathead sole,  rock sole, and yellowfin sole as determined under the annual harvest  specifications at Sec. 679.20(c) shall be allocated among the CDQ  groups based on the CDQ percentage allocations under 16 U.S.C.  1855(i)(1)(C), unless modified under 16 U.S.C. 1855</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(1)(H)</em>; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An amount equivalent to 0.7 percent of the ABC reserve for  flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole as determined under the  annual harvest specifications at Sec. 679.20(c) shall be allocated  among the CDQ groups by the panel established in section 305(i)(1)(G) of  the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfers. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer CDQ or PSQ  from one group to another group by each group submitting a completed  transfer request as described in Sec. 679.5(n)(1). NMFS will approve  the transfer request if the CDQ group transferring quota to another CDQ  group has sufficient quota available for transfer. If NMFS approves the  request, NMFS will make the requested transfer(s) by decreasing the  account balance of the CDQ group from which the CDQ or PSQ species is  transferred and by increasing the account balance of the CDQ group  receiving the transferred CDQ or PSQ species. The PSQ will be  transferred as of the date NMFS approves the transfer request and is  effective only for the remainder of the calendar year in which the  transfer occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accessing CDQ ABC reserves. Each CDQ group may request that NMFS  approve a Flatfish Exchange to add flathead sole, rock sole, or  yellowfin sole to its CDQ account in exchange for reducing its CDQ  account by an equal amount of flathead sole, rock sole, or yellowfin  sole. CDQ groups may request Flatfish Exchanges by submitting a  completed Flatfish Exchange Application as described at Sec. 679.4(p).
