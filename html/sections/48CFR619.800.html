The Department of State has signed an MOU with SBA, effective May 6, 1998. Under the MOU, a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole source or competitive basis. The SBA reserves the right to withdraw any delegation issued as a result of an MOU; however, any such withdrawal shall have no effect on contracts currently awarded under the MOU.</p>
