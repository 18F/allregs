                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining capability of ITO. If the ITO wishes to administer  its own SNAP on the reservation FNS shall determine the ITO's potential  capability for administering SNAP in accordance with the criteria listed  in Sec. 281.4(b). FNS shall begin to evaluate the ITO's capability for  all aspects of SNAP administration, allowing for fulfillment of that  potential through necessary   training and technical assistance, not later than the date of the  issuance of the formal warning to the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ITO responsibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ITO must satisfy FNS that it is  capable (if provided with any needed training and technical assistance)  of administering SNAP effectively and efficiently, and of complying with  all provisions of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, and  the regulations of this chapter, including provisions governing quality  control procedures, fraud determinations, and establishment and  collection of claims for both Indian and any non-Indian participants.  The ITO shall provide FNS with the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operation of government programs. The ITO shall provide FNS a  list of all government programs that the ITO administers and has  recently administered. FNS may ask the ITO to provide the names of  appropriate officials of the government organizations having  jurisdiction over these programs so FNS can obtain all relevant audits,  GAO reports, program evaluations and any other documents pertaining to  the effectiveness and efficiency of tribal administration of these  programs. The ITO shall also provide FNS a list of its recent  contractual responsibilities, if any, for SNAP under Sec. 281.2(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fiscal capabilities. The ITO shall provide FNS documentation of  its bookeeping and accounting procedures, including procedures in use  for fiscal accountability under part 277 and for other government  programs that the ITO administers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Projected certification and issuance facilities. The ITO shall  provide FNS with a description of the location of projected  certification and issuance facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fraud hearings and claims. The ITO shall provide FNS with a  description of how it will pursue fraud hearings and claims against  Indian and non-Indian participants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Staffing. The ITO shall provide FNS with sufficient information  to determine that personnel who will be used in the certification  process will be employed under standards equivalent to current standards  for a Merit System of Personnel Administration or any standards later  prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management under section 208 of  the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Civil rights assurance. The ITO shall provide FNS an assurance  that the ITO shall comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (Pub. L. 88-352), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (Pub. L. 94-135),  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 99-112), section 504), and  section 11(c) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and all pertinent  regulations or directives to the effect that no person in the United  States shall, on the grounds of sex, race, color, age, political belief,  religion, handicap, or national origin, be denied benefits or otherwise  be subject to discrimination under SNAP. Where appropriate, FNS shall  consider the adequacy of measures taken by the ITO to ensure that there  shall be no discrimination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the determination of ITO capability, FNS shall consult  with other sources such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to obtain  any information relevant to the capability determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If it is determined by FNS, after consultation with other  sources such as the BIA, that the ITO is not capable of operating an  efficient and effective SNAP, the agency of the State government shall  continue to operate the Program on the reservation in accordance with  Sec. 281.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Training and technical assistance. Upon determining that the  State agency has failed to properly administer SNAP and that the ITO is  potentially capable of operating an effective and efficient SNAP, FNS  shall determine, based on information provided by the ITO and other  sources such as BIA, the training and technical assistance which is  necessary to assure efficient and effective program administration. FNS  will assure that appropriate training and technical assistance is  provided as expeditiously as possible prior to the ITO's assumption of  the administration of SNAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assumption of duties. When FNS is satisfied that the ITO has  successfully completed (c) of this section, FNS shall designate the ITO  as a State agency, contingent on the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(vi)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed budget. As part of the Plan of Operation, the ITO shall  annually submit to FNS a proposed statement which shall provide a  summary of program information and amounts budgeted to carry out the  various program functions. This information shall be submitted to FNS  for approval prior to the commitment of any Federal funds for  administrative costs for that year. FNS shall provide the ITO any  technical assistance which is necessary to prepare this information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Termination and transition arrangement. An effective termination  and transition arrangement shall be established as required in  Sec. 281.8.</p>
