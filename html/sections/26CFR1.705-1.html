                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) Section 705 and this section provide rules for determining the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership. A partner is required to determine the adjusted basis of his interest in a partnership only when necessary for the determination of his tax liability or that of any other person. The determination of the adjusted basis of a partnership interest is ordinarily made as of the end of a partnership taxable year. Thus, for example, such year-end determination is necessary in ascertaining the extent to which a partner's distributive share of partnership losses may be allowed. See section 704(d). However, where there has been a sale or exchange of all or a part of a partnership interest or a liquidation of a partner's entire interest in a partnership, the adjusted basis of the partner's interest should be determined as of the date of sale or exchange or liquidation. The adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership is determined without regard to any amount shown in the partnership books as the partner's ``capital'', ``equity'', or similar account. For example, A contributes property with an adjusted basis to him of $400 (and a value of $1,000) to a partnership. B contributes $1,000 cash. While under their agreement each may have a ``capital account'' in the partnership of $1,000, the adjusted basis of A's interest is only $400 and B's interest $1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 705 and this section provide rules for determining the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership.

Such basis shall be increased under section 722 by any further contributions to the partnership and by the sum of the partner's distributive share for the taxable year and prior taxable years of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Taxable income of the partnership as determined under section 703(a),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tax-exempt receipts of the partnership, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The excess of the deductions for depletion over the basis of the depletable property, unless the property is an oil or gas property the basis of which has been allocated to partners under section 613A(c)(7)(D).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The basis shall be decreased (but not below zero) by distributions from the partnership as provided in section 733 and by the sum of the partner's distributive share for the taxable year and prior taxable years of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Partnership losses (including capital losses), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Partnership expenditures which are not deductible in computing partnership taxable income or loss and which are not capital expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The basis shall be decreased (but not below zero) by the amount of the partner's deduction for depletion allowable under section 611 for any partnership oil and gas property to the extent the deduction does not exceed the proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the property allocated to the partner under section 613A(c)(7)(D).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The basis shall be adjusted (but not below zero) to reflect any gain or loss to the partner resulting from a disposition by the partnership of a domestic oil or gas property after December 31, 1974.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For the effect of liabilities in determining the amount of contributions made by a partner to a partnership or the amount of distributions made by a partnership to a partner, see section 752 and Sec. 1.752-1, relating to the treatment of certain liabilities. In determining the basis of a partnership interest on the effective date of subchapter K, chapter 1 of the Code, or any of the sections thereof, the partner's share of partnership liabilities on that date shall be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For basis adjustments necessary to coordinate sections 705 and 1032 in certain situations in which a partnership disposes of stock or any position in stock to which section 1032 applies of a corporation that holds a direct or

indirect interest in the partnership, see Sec. 1.705-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For basis adjustments necessary to coordinate sections 705 and 358(h), see Sec. 1.358-7(b). For certain basis adjustments with respect to a Sec. 1.752-7 liability assumed by a partnership from a partner, see Sec. 1.752-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For basis adjustments necessary to coordinate sections 705 and 362(e)(2), see Sec. 1.362-4(f)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative rule. In certain cases, the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership may be determined by reference to the partner's share of the adjusted basis of partnership property which would be distributable upon termination of the partnership. The alternative rule may be used to determine the adjusted basis of a partner's interest where circumstances are such that the partner cannot practicably apply the general rule set forth in section 705(a) and paragraph (a) of this section, or where, from a consideration of all the facts, it is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, reasonable to conclude that the result produced will not vary substantially from the result obtainable under the general rule. Where the alternative rule is used, adjustments may be necessary in determining the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership. Adjustments would be required, for example, in order to reflect in a partner's share of the adjusted basis of partnership property any significant discrepancies arising as a result of contributed property, transfers of partnership interests, or distributions of property to the partners. The operation of the alternative rules may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The ABC partnership, in which A, B, and C are equal partners, owns various properties with a total adjusted basis of $1,500 and has earned and retained an additional $1,500. The total adjusted basis of partnership property is thus $3,000. Each partner's share in the adjusted basis of partnership property is one-third of this amount, or $1,000. Under the alternative rule, this amount represents each partner's adjusted basis for his partnership interest.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume that partner A in example 1 of this paragraph sells his partnership interest to D for $1,250 at a time when the partnership property with an adjusted basis of $1,500 had appreciated in value to $3,000, and when the partnership also had $750 in cash. The total adjusted basis of all partnership property is $2,250 and the value of such property is $3,750. D's basis for his partnership interest is his cost, $1,250. However, his one-third share of the adjusted basis of partnership property is only $750. Therefore, for the purposes of the alternative rule, D has an adjustment of $500 in determining the basis of his interest. This amount represents the difference between the cost of his partnership interest and his share of partnership basis at the time of his purchase. If the partnership subsequently earns and retains an additional $1,500, its property will have an adjusted basis of $3,750. D's adjusted basis for his interest under the alternative rule is $1,750, determined by adding $500, his basis adjustment to $1,250 (his one-third share of the $3,750 adjusted basis of partnership property). If the partnership distributes $250 to each partner in a current distribution, D's adjusted basis for his interest will be $1,500 ($1,000, his one-third share of the remaining basis of partnership property, $3,000, plus his basis adjustment of $500).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume that BCD partnership in example 2 of this paragraph continues to operate. In 1960, D proposes to sell his partnership interest and wishes to evaluate the tax consequences of such sale. It is necessary, therefore, to determine the adjusted basis of his interest in the partnership. Assume further that D cannot determine the adjusted basis of his interest under the general rule. The balance sheet of the BCD partnership is as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Adjusted</p><p class="depth2">Assets                        basis per    Market</p><p class="depth2">books       value------------------------------------------------------------------------Cash............................................      $3,000      $3,000Receivables.....................................       4,000       4,000Depreciable property............................       5,000       5,000Land held for investment........................      18,000      30,000</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------</p><p class="depth2">Total.......................................      30,000      42,000------------------------------------------------------------------------

See example 2 of this paragraph. The adjusted basis of D's partnership interest determined under the alternative rule is as follows:
D's share of the adjusted basis of partnership property          $15,000</p><p class="depth2">(reduced by the amount of liabilities) at time of proposed</p><p class="depth2">sale.......................................................</p><p class="depth2">D's share of partnership liabilities (under the partnership        2,000</p><p class="depth2">agreement liabilities are shared equally)..................D's basis adjustment from example 2.........................         500</p><p class="depth2">-----------</p><p class="depth2">Adjusted basis of D's interest at the time of proposed        17,500</p><p class="depth2">sale, as determined under alternative rule.............</p><p class="depth2">[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960, 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8437, 57 FR 43903, Sept. 23, 1992; T.D. 8986, 67 FR 15114, Mar. 29, 2002; T.D. 9049, 68 FR 12816, Mar. 18, 2003; T.D. 9207, 70 FR 30342, May 26, 2005; T.D. 9633, 78 FR 54168, Sept. 3, 2013]</p>
