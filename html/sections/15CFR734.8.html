                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fundamental research. Paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section  and Sec. 734.11 of this part provide specific rules that will be used  to determine whether research in particular institutional contexts  qualifies as ``fundamental research''. The intent behind these rules is  to identify as ``fundamental research'' basic and applied research in  science and engineering, where the resulting information is ordinarily  published and shared broadly within the scientific community. Such  research can be distinguished from proprietary research and from  industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the  results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary reasons or  specific national security reasons as defined in Sec. 734.11(b) of this  part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(8)). Note that the  provisions of this section do not apply to encryption software  classified under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (Supplement No.  1 to part 774 of the EAR), except publicly available encryption object  code software classified under ECCN 5D002 when the corresponding source  code meets the criteria specified in Sec. 740.13(e) of the EAR. See  Sec. 740.13(e) of the EAR for eligibility requirements for exports and  reexports of publicly available encryption source code under License  Exception TSU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> University based research. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research conducted by scientists,  engineers, or students at a university normally will be considered  fundamental research, as described in paragraphs (b) (2) through (6) of  this section. (``University'' means any accredited institution of higher  education located in the United States.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely  to insure that the publication would not inadvertently divulge  proprietary information that the sponsor has furnished to the  researchers does not change the status of the research as fundamental  research. However, release of information from a corporate sponsor to  university researchers where the research results are subject to  prepublication review, is subject to the EAR. (See Supplement No. 1 to  this part, Questions D(7), D(9), and D(10).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely  to ensure that publication would not compromise patent rights does not  change the status of fundamental research, so long as the review causes  no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor to  university researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties have  agreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all of the  information so provided. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question  D(2).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> University based research is not considered ``fundamental  research'' if the university or its researchers accept (at the request,  for example, of an industrial sponsor) other restrictions on publication  of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or  activity. Scientific and technical information resulting from the  research will nonetheless qualify as fundamental research once all such  restrictions have expired or have been removed. (See Supplement No. 1 to  this part, Question D(7) and D(9).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The provisions of Sec. 734.11 of this part will apply if a  university or its researchers accept specific national security controls  (as defined in Sec. 734.11 of this part) on a research project or  activity sponsored by the U.S. Government. (See Supplement No. 1 to this  part, Questions E(1) and E(2).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Research based at Federal agencies or FFRDCs. Research conducted  by scientists or engineers working for a Federal agency or a Federally  Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) may be designated as  ``fundamental research'' within any appropriate system devised by the  agency or the FFRDC to control the release of information by such  scientists and engineers. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions  D(8) and D(11).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Corporate research. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research conducted by scientists or  engineers working for a business entity will be considered ``fundamental  research'' at such time and to the extent that the researchers are free  to make scientific and technical information resulting from the research  publicly available without restriction or delay based on proprietary  concerns or specific national security controls as defined in Sec.  734.11(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that the  publication would compromise no proprietary information provided by the  company to the researchers is not considered to be a proprietary  restriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, paragraph  (d)(1) of this section does not authorize the release of information to  university researchers where the research results are subject to  prepublication review. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions  D(8), D(9), and D(10).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that  prepublication would compromise no patent rights will not be considered  a proprietary restriction for this purpose, so long as the review causes  no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> However, the initial transfer of information from a business  entity to researchers is not authorized under the ``fundamental  research'' provision where the parties have agreed that the business  entity may withhold from publication some or all of the information so  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Research based elsewhere. Research conducted by scientists or  engineers who are not working for any of the institutions described in  paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section will be treated as corporate  research, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (See Supplement  No. 1 to this part, Question D(8).)
