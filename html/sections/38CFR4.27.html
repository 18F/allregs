                            <p class="depth0">The diagnostic code numbers appearing opposite the listed ratable  disabilities are arbitrary numbers for the purpose of showing the basis  of the evaluation assigned and for statistical analysis in the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and as will be observed, extend from  5000 to a possible 9999. Great care will be exercised in the selection  of the applicable code number and in its citation on the rating sheet.  No other numbers than these listed or hereafter furnished are to be  employed for rating purposes, with an exception as described in this  section, as to unlisted conditions. When an unlisted disease, injury, or  residual condition is encountered, requiring rating by analogy, the  diagnostic code number will be ``built-up'' as follows: The first 2  digits will be selected from that part of the schedule most closely  identifying the part, or system, of the body involved; the last 2 digits  will be ``99'' for all unlisted conditions. This procedure will  facilitate a close check of new and unlisted conditions, rated by  analogy. In the selection of code numbers, injuries will generally be  represented by the number assigned to the residual condition on the  basis of which the rating is determined. With diseases, preference is to  be given to the number assigned to the disease itself; if the rating is  determined on the basis of residual conditions, the number appropriate  to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen. Thus,  rheumatoid (atrophic) arthritis rated as ankylosis of the lumbar spine  should be coded ``5002-5240.'' In this way, the exact source of each  rating can be easily identified. In the citation of disabilities on  rating sheets, the diagnostic terminology will be that of the medical  examiner, with no attempt to translate the terms into schedule  nomenclature. Residuals of diseases or therapeutic procedures will not  be cited without reference to the basic disease.  [41 FR 11293, Mar. 18, 1976, as amended at 70 FR 75399, Dec. 20, 2005]</p>
