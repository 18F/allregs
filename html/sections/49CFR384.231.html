A State must satisfy the  requirement of this subpart that the State disqualify a person required  to have a CLP or CDL who is convicted of an offense or offenses  necessitating disqualification under Sec. 383.51 of this subchapter. At  a minimum, the State must implement the limitation on licensing  provisions of Sec. 384.210 and the timing and recordkeeping  requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section so as to prevent  such a person from legally obtaining a CLP or CDL from any State during  the applicable disqualification period(s) specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required timing.
