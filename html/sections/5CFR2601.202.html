                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The authorized agency official will have the authority to solicit, accept, refuse, return, or negotiate the terms of acceptance of a gift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee, other than an authorized agency official, will immediately forward all offers of gifts covered by this part regardless of value to an authorized agency official for consideration and will provide a description of the gift offered. An employee will also inform an authorized agency official of all discussions of the possibility of a gift. An employee will not provide a donor with any commitment, privilege, concession or other present or future benefit (other than an appropriate acknowledgment) in return for a gift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only an authorized agency official may solicit, accept or decline a gift after making the determination required under the conflict of interest standard in Sec. 2601.203. An authorized

agency official may find that, while acceptance of an offered gift is permissible, it is in the interest of the agency to qualify acceptance by, for example, limiting the gift in some way. Approval of acceptance of a gift in-kind after receipt of the gift may be granted as deemed appropriate by the authorized agency official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gifts may be acknowledged in writing in the form of a letter of acceptance to the donor. The amount of a monetary gift will be specified. In the case of nonmonetary gifts, the letter will not make reference to the value of the gift. Valuation of nonmonetary gifts is the responsibility of the donor. Letters of acceptance will not include any statement regarding the tax implications of a gift, which remain the responsibility of the donor. No statement of endorsement should appear in a letter of acceptance to the donor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A gift may be declined by an authorized official orally or in writing. A donor may be advised of the reason why the gift has been declined. A gift may be declined solely as a matter of agency discretion, even though acceptance would not be precluded under the conflict of interest standard in Sec. 2601.203.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A gift of money or the proceeds of a gift will be deposited in an appropriately documented agency fund. A check or money order should be made payable to the ``U.S. Office of Government Ethics.''
