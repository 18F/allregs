                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The amount of interest expense of a  foreign corporation that is allocable under section 882(c) to income  which is (or is treated as) effectively connected with the conduct of a  trade or business within the United States (ECI) is the sum of the  interest allocable by the foreign corporation under the three-step  process set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and  the specially allocated interest expense determined under paragraph  (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The provisions of this section provide the  exclusive rules for allocating   interest expense to the ECI of a foreign corporation under section  882(c). Under the three-step process, the total value of the U.S. assets  of a foreign corporation is first determined under paragraph (b) of this  section (Step 1). Next, the amount of U.S.-connected liabilities is  determined under paragraph (c) of this section (Step 2). Finally, the  amount of interest paid or accrued on U.S.-booked liabilities, as  determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, is adjusted for  interest expense attributable to the difference between U.S.-connected  liabilities and U.S.-booked liabilities (Step 3). Alternatively, a  foreign corporation may elect to determine its interest rate on U.S.- connected liabilities by reference to its U.S. assets, using the  separate currency pools method described in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> shall reduce the basis  of the asset that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.861-10T (b) or (c)  by the principal amount of the indebtedness that meets the requirements  of Sec. 1.861- 10T (b) or (c). The foreign corporation shall also  disregard any indebtedness that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.861- 10T (b) or (c) in determining the amount of the foreign corporation's  liabilities under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(2) of this section and shall  not take into account any interest expense paid or accrued with respect  to such a liability for purposes of paragraph (d) or (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the partnership's basis in such asset by the amount of  such indebtedness in allocating its basis in the partnership under Sec.  1.884-1(d)(3)(ii); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduce the partnership's income from such asset by the  partnership's interest expense from such indebtedness under Sec. 1.884- 1(d)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coordination with tax treaties. Except as expressly provided by  or pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty or accompanying documents (such  as an exchange of notes), the provisions of this section provide the  exclusive rules for determining the interest expense attributable to the  business profits of a permanent establishment under a U.S. income tax  treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on interest expense. In no event may the amount of  interest expense computed under this section exceed the amount of  interest on indebtedness paid or accrued by the taxpayer within the  taxable year (translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average  exchange rate for each currency prescribed by Sec. 1.989(b)-1 for the  taxable year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Translation convention for foreign currency. For each  computation required by this section, the taxpayer shall translate  values and amounts into the relevant currency at a spot rate or a  weighted average exchange rate consistent with the method such taxpayer  uses for financial reporting   purposes, provided such method is applied consistently from year to  year. Interest expense paid or accrued, however, shall be translated  under the rules of Sec. 1.988-2. The director of field operations or  the Assistant Commissioner (International) may require that any or all  computations required by this section be made in U.S. dollars if the  functional currency of the taxpayer's home office is a hyperinflationary  currency, as defined in Sec. 1.985-1, and the computation in U.S.  dollars is necessary to prevent distortions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coordination with other sections. Any provision that disallows,  defers, or capitalizes interest expense applies after determining the  amount of interest expense allocated to ECI under this section. For  example, in determining the amount of interest expense that is  disallowed as a deduction under section 265 or 163(j), deferred under  section 163(e)(3) or 267(a)(3), or capitalized under section 263A with  respect to a United States trade or business, a taxpayer takes into  account only the amount of interest expense allocable to ECI under this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> does not apply to controlled commercial entities within  the meaning of Sec. 1.892-5T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Elections under Sec. 1.882-5--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A corporation  must make each election provided in this section on the corporation's  original timely filed Federal income tax return for the first taxable  year it is subject to the rules of this section. An amended return does  not qualify for this purpose, nor shall the provisions of Sec.  301.9100-1 of this chapter and any guidance promulgated thereunder  apply. Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each election under  this section, whether an election for the first taxable year or a  subsequent change of election, shall be made by indicating the method  used on Schedule I (Form 1120-F) attached to the corporation's timely  filed return. An elected method (other than the fair market value method  under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, or the annual 30-day London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) election in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this  section) must be used for a minimum period of five years before the  taxpayer may elect a different method. To change an election before the  end of the requisite five-year period, a taxpayer must obtain the  consent of the Commissioner or his delegate. The Commissioner or his  delegate will generally consent to a taxpayer's request to change its  election only in rare and unusual circumstances. After the five-year  minimum period, an elected method may be changed for any subsequent year  on the foreign corporation's original timely filed tax return for the  first year to which the changed election applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to make the proper election. If a taxpayer, for any  reason, fails to make an election provided in this section in a timely  fashion, the Director of Field Operations may make any or all of the  elections provided in this section on behalf of the taxpayer, and such  elections shall be binding as if made by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> is subject to  the adjusted basis or fair market value conforming election requirements  of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section and may   not be made if a taxpayer elects or maintains a fair market value  election for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. Taxpayers that  already use the fixed ratio method under an existing election may  continue to use the new fixed ratio at the higher percentage without  having to make a new five-year election in the first year that the  higher percentage is effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts: FC is a foreign  corporation that conducts business through a branch, B, in the United  States. Among B's U.S. assets is an interest in a partnership, P, that  is engaged in airplane leasing solely in the U.S. FC contributes 200x to  P in exchange for its partnership interest. P incurs qualified  nonrecourse indebtedness within the meaning of Sec. 1.861-10T to  purchase an airplane. FC's share of the liability of P, as determined  under section 752, is 800x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this  section, the 800x liability is disregarded for purposes of determining  FC's liabilities under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) and (d)(2)(vii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FC is a foreign  corporation that conducts a real estate business in the United States.  In its 1997 tax year, FC has no outstanding indebtedness, and therefore  incurs no interest expense. FC elects to use the 50% fixed ratio under  paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, FC is not allowed to  deduct any interest expense that exceeds the amount of interest on  indebtedness paid or accrued in that taxable year. Since FC incurred no  interest expense in taxable year 1997, FC will not be entitled to any  interest deduction for that year under Sec. 1.882-5, notwithstanding  the fact that FC has elected to use the 50% fixed ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section. The first asset is a taxable security with an adjusted basis of  $100. The second asset is an obligation the interest on which is exempt  from federal taxation under section 103, with an adjusted basis of $50.  The tax-exempt obligation is not a qualified tax-exempt obligation as  defined by section 265(b)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FC calculates its interest expense under Sec. 1.882-5 to be  $12. Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, however, a portion of the  interest expense that is allocated to FC's effectively connected income  under Sec. 1.882-5 is disallowed in accordance with the provisions of  section 265(b). Using the methodology prescribed under section 265, the  amount of disallowed interest expense is $4, calculated as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08MR96.000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Therefore, FC deducts a total of $8 ($12-$4) of interest  expense attributable to its effectively connected income in 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FC is a foreign corporation,  resident in Country X, that is actively engaged in the banking business  in the United States through a permanent establishment, B. The income  tax treaty in effect between Country X and the United States provides  that FC is not taxable on foreign source income earned by its U.S.  permanent establishment. In its 1997 tax year, B earns $90 of U.S.  source income from U.S. assets with an adjusted tax basis of $900, and  $12 of foreign source interest income from U.S. assets with an adjusted  tax basis of $100. FC's U.S. interest expense deduction, computed in  accordance with Sec. 1.882-5, is $500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, FC is required to apply  any provision that disallows, defers, or capitalizes interest expense  after determining the interest expense allocated to ECI under Sec.  1.882-5. Section 265(a)(2) disallows interest expense that is allocable  to one or more classes of income that are wholly exempt from taxation  under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1.265-1(b)  provides that income wholly exempt from taxes includes both income  excluded from tax under any provision of subtitle A and income wholly  exempt from taxes under any other law. Section 894 specifies   that the provisions of subtitle A are applied with due regard to any  relevant treaty obligation of the United States. Because the treaty  between the United States and Country X exempts foreign source income  earned by B from U.S. tax, FC has assets that produce income wholly  exempt from taxes under subtitle A, and must therefore allocate a  portion of its Sec. 1.882-5 interest expense to its exempt income.  Using the methodology prescribed under section 265, the amount of  disallowed interest expense is $50, calculated as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.029</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Therefore, FC deducts a total of $450 ($500-$50) of interest  expense attributable to its effectively connected income in 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step 1: Determination of total value of U.S. assets for the  taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classification of an asset as a U.S. asset--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1), an  asset is a U.S. asset for purposes of this section to the extent that it  is a U.S. asset under Sec. 1.884-1(d). For purposes of this section,  the term determination date, as used in Sec. 1.884-1(d), means each day  for which the total value of U.S. assets is computed under paragraph  (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items excluded from the definition of U.S. asset. For purposes  of this section, the term U.S. asset excludes an asset to the extent it  produces income or gain described in sections 883 (a)(3) and (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Items included in the definition of U.S. asset. For purposes  of this section, the term U.S. asset includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> U.S. real property held in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of  a foreign corporation that qualifies as a bank under section  585(a)(2)(B) (without regard to the second sentence thereof), provided  that the real property would qualify as used in the foreign  corporation's trade or business within the meaning of Sec. 1.864-4(c)  (2) or (3) if held directly by the foreign corporation and either was  initially acquired through foreclosure or similar proceedings or is U.S.  real property occupied by the foreign corporation (the value of which  shall be adjusted by the amount of any indebtedness that is reflected in  the value of the property);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An asset that produces income treated as ECI under section  921(d) or 926(b) (relating to certain income of a FSC and certain  dividends paid by a FSC to a foreign corporation);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> (relating to certain income of a captive insurance company  that a corporation elects to treat as ECI) that is not otherwise ECI;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An asset that produces income treated as ECI under section  882(e) (relating to certain interest income of possessions banks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Interbranch transactions. A transaction of any type between  separate offices or branches of the same taxpayer does not create a U.S.  asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assets acquired to increase U.S. assets artificially. An asset  shall not be treated as a U.S. asset if one of the principal purposes  for acquiring or using that asset is to increase artificially the U.S.  assets of a foreign corporation on the determination date. Whether an  asset is acquired or used for such purpose will depend upon all the  facts and circumstances of each case. Factors to be considered in  determining whether one of the principal purposes in acquiring or using  an asset is to increase artificially the U.S. assets of a foreign  corporation include the length of time during which the asset was used  in a U.S. trade or business, whether the asset was acquired from a  related person, and whether the aggregate value of the U.S. assets of  the foreign corporation increased temporarily on or around the  determination date. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it  is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of the value of a U.S. asset--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  The value of a U.S. asset is the adjusted basis of the   asset for determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of  that item, further adjusted as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fair-market value election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general--(1) Fair market value conformity requirement. A  taxpayer may elect to value all of its U.S. assets on the basis of fair  market value, subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(1)(iii),  and provided the taxpayer is eligible and uses the actual ratio method  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the methodology prescribed in  Sec. 1.861-9T(h). Once elected, the fair market value must be used by  the taxpayer for both Step 1 and Step 2 described in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section, and must be used in all subsequent taxable years  unless the Commissioner or his delegate consents to a change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, may do so on an original timely filed return. If a  conforming election is not made within the timeframe provided in this  paragraph, the Director of Field Operations or his delegate may make the  conforming elections in accordance with the provisions of paragraph  (a)(7)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjustment to partnership basis. If a partner makes a fair  market value election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the  value of the partner's interest in a partnership that is treated as an  asset shall be the fair market value of his partnership interest,  increased by the fair market value of the partner's share of the  liabilities determined under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section. See  Sec. 1.884-1(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reduction of total value of U.S. assets by amount of bad debt  reserves under section 585--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The total value of loans  that qualify as U.S. assets shall be reduced by the amount of any  reserve for bad debts additions to which are allowed as deductions under  section 585.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign banks; bad debt reserves. FC is a foreign  corporation that qualifies as a bank under section 585(a)(2)(B) (without  regard to the second sentence thereof), but is not a large bank as  defined in section 585(c)(2). FC conducts business through a branch, B,  in the United States. Among B's U.S. assets are a portfolio of loans  with an adjusted basis of $500. FC accounts for its bad debts for U.S.  federal income tax purposes under the reserve method, and B maintains a  deductible reserve for bad debts of $50. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of  this section, the total value of FC's portfolio of loans is $450 ($500- $50).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation of total value of U.S. assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The  total value of U.S. assets for the taxable year is the average of the  sums of the values (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section)  of U.S. assets. For each U.S. asset, value shall be computed at the most  frequent regular intervals for   which data are reasonably available. In no event shall the value of any  U.S. asset be computed less frequently than monthly (beginning of  taxable year and monthly thereafter) by a large bank (as defined in  section 585(c)(2)) or a dealer in securities (within the meaning of  section 475) and semi-annually (beginning, middle and end of taxable  year) by any other taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustment to basis of financial instruments. For purposes of  determining the total average value of U.S. assets in this paragraph  (b)(3), the value of a security or contract that is marked to market  pursuant to section 475 or section 1256 shall be determined as if each  determination date is the most frequent regular interval for which data  are reasonably available that reflects the taxpayer's consistent  business practices for reflecting mark-to-market valuations on its books  and records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Step 2: Determination of total amount of U.S.-connected  liabilities for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The amount of U.S.- connected liabilities for the taxable year equals the total value of  U.S. assets for the taxable year (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)  of this section) multiplied by the actual ratio for the taxable year (as  determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) or, if the taxpayer  has made an election in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this  section, by the fixed ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computation of the actual ratio--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer's  actual ratio for the taxable year is the total amount of its worldwide  liabilities for the taxable year divided by the total value of its  worldwide assets for the taxable year. The total amount of worldwide  liabilities and the total value of worldwide assets for the taxable year  is the average of the sums of the amounts of the taxpayer's worldwide  liabilities and the values of its worldwide assets (determined under  paragraphs (c)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section). In each case, the  sums must be computed semi-annually (beginning, middle and end of  taxable year) by a large bank (as defined in section 585(c)(2)) and  annually (beginning and end of taxable year) by any other taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Classification of items. The classification of an item as a  liability or an asset must be consistent from year to year and in  accordance with U.S. tax principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of amount of worldwide liabilities. The amount  of a liability must be determined consistently from year to year and  must be substantially in accordance with U.S. tax principles. To be  substantially in accordance with U.S. tax principles, the principles  used to determine the amount of a liability must not differ from U.S.  tax principles to a degree that will materially affect the value of  taxpayer's worldwide liabilities or the taxpayer's actual ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this section. The rules of paragraph (b)(3)  of this section apply in determining the total value of applicable  worldwide assets for the taxable year, except that the minimum number of  determination dates are those stated in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Hedging transactions. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em>. For purposes of this section a partner shares in  any liability of a partnership in the same proportion that it shares,  for income tax purposes, in the expense attributable to that liability  for the taxable year. A partner's adjusted basis in a partnership  interest cannot be less than zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Computation of actual ratio of insurance companies. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Interbranch transactions. A transaction of any type between  separate offices or branches of the same taxpayer does not create an  asset or a liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Amounts must be expressed in a single currency. The actual  ratio must be computed in either U.S. dollars or the functional currency  of the home office of the taxpayer, and that currency must be used  consistently from year to year. For example, a taxpayer that determines  the actual ratio annually using British pounds converted at the spot  rate for financial reporting purposes must translate the U.S. dollar  values of assets and amounts of liabilities of the U.S. trade or  business into pounds using the spot rate on the last day of its taxable  year. The director of field operations or the Assistant Commissioner  (International) may require that the actual ratio be computed in dollars  if the functional currency of the taxpayer's home office is a  hyperinflationary currency, as defined in Sec. 1.985-1, that materially  distorts the actual ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments. The director of field operations or the Assistant  Commissioner (International) may make appropriate adjustments to prevent  a foreign corporation from intentionally and artificially increasing its  actual ratio. For example, the director of field operations or the  Assistant Commissioner (International) may offset a loan made from or to  one person with a loan made to or from another person if any of the  parties to the loans are related persons, within the meaning of section  267(b) or 707(b)(1), and one of the principal purposes for entering into  the loans was to increase artificially the actual ratio of a foreign  corporation. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is  outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Elective fixed ratio method of determining U.S. liabilities. A  taxpayer that is a bank as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) (without  regard to the second sentence thereof or whether any such activities are  effectively connected with a trade or business within the United States)  may elect to use a fixed ratio of 95 percent in lieu of the actual  ratio. A taxpayer that is neither a bank nor an insurance company may  elect to use a fixed ratio of 50 percent in lieu of the actual ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Classification of item not in accordance with U.S. tax  principles. Bank Z, a resident of country X, has a branch in the United  States through which it conducts its banking business. In preparing its  financial statements in country X, Z treats an instrument documented as  perpetual subordinated debt as a liability. Under U.S. tax principles,  however, this instrument is treated as equity. Consequently, the  classification of this instrument as a liability for purposes of  paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section is not in accordance with U.S. tax  principles.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Valuation of item not substantially in accordance with  U.S. tax principles. Bank Z, a resident of country X, has a branch in  the United States through which it conducts its banking business. Bank Z  is a large bank as defined in section 585(c)(2). The tax rules of  country X allow Bank Z to take deductions for additions to certain  reserves. Bank Z decreases the value of the assets on its financial  statements by the amounts of the reserves. The additions to the reserves  under country X tax rules cause the value of Bank Z's assets to differ  from the value of those assets determined under U.S. tax principles to a  degree that materially affects the value of taxpayer's worldwide assets.  Consequently, the valuation of Bank Z's worldwide assets under country X  tax principles is not substantially in accordance with U.S. tax  principles. Bank Z must increase the value of its worldwide assets under  paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section by the amount of its country X  reserves.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Valuation of item substantially in accordance with U.S.  tax principles. Bank Z, a resident of country X, has a branch in the  United States through which it conducts its banking business. In  determining the value of its worldwide assets, Bank Z computes the  adjusted basis of certain non-U.S. assets according to the depreciation  methodology   provided under country X tax laws, which is different than the  depreciation methodology provided under U.S. tax law. If the  depreciation methodology provided under country X tax laws does not  differ from U.S. tax principles to a degree that materially affects the  value of Bank Z's worldwide assets or Bank Z's actual ratio as computed  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, then the valuation of Bank Z's  worldwide assets under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section is  substantially in accordance with U.S. tax principles.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Adjustments. FC is a foreign corporation engaged in the  active conduct of a banking business through a branch, B, in the United  States. P, an unrelated foreign corporation, deposits $100,000 in the  home office of FC. Shortly thereafter, in a transaction arranged by the  home office of FC, B lends $80,000 bearing interest at an arm's length  rate to S, a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of P. The director of field  operations or the Assistant Commissioner (International) determines that  one of the principal purposes for making and incurring such loans is to  increase FC's actual ratio. For purposes of this section, therefore, P  is treated as having directly lent $80,000 to S. Thus, for purposes of  paragraph (c) of this section (Step 2), the director of field operations  or the Assistant Commissioner (International) may offset FC's liability  and asset arising from this transaction, resulting in a net liability of  $20,000 that is not a booked liability of B. Because the loan to S from  B was initiated and arranged by the home office of FC, with no material  participation by B, the loan to S will not be treated as a U.S. asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Step 3: Determination of amount of interest expense allocable to  ECI under the adjusted U.S. booked liabilities method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  The adjustment to the amount of interest expense paid or accrued on U.S.  booked liabilities is determined by comparing the amount of U.S.- connected liabilities for the taxable year, as determined under  paragraph (c) of this section, with the average total amount of U.S.  booked liabilities, as determined under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of  this section. If the average total amount of U.S. booked liabilities  equals or exceeds the amount of U.S.-connected liabilities, the  adjustment to the interest expense on U.S. booked liabilities is  determined under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FC is a foreign corporation that is not a bank and that actively  conducts a real estate business through a branch, B, in the United  States. For the taxable year, FC's balance sheet and income statement is  as follows (assume amounts are in U.S. dollars and computed in  accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Asset 1.............................................    $2,000 Asset 2.............................................     2,500 Asset 3.............................................     5,500</p><p class="depth0">Amount   Interest</p><p class="depth0">Expense Liability 1.........................................      $800        56 Liability 2.........................................     3,200       256 Capital.............................................     6,000         0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Asset 1 is the stock of FC's wholly-owned domestic subsidiary  that is also actively engaged in the real estate business.   Asset 2 is a building in the United States producing rental income that  is entirely ECI to FC. Asset 3 is a building in the home country of FC  that produces rental income. Liabilities 1 and 2 are loans that bear  interest at the rates of 7% and 8%, respectively. Liability 1 is a  booked liability of B, and Liability 2 is booked in FC's home country.  Assume that FC has not elected to use the fixed ratio in Step 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 1. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Assets 1 and 3  are not U.S. assets, while Asset 2 qualifies as a U.S. asset. Thus,  under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the total value of U.S. assets  for the taxable year is $2,500, the value of Asset 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Step 2. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of  FC's U.S.-connected liabilities for the taxable year is determined by  multiplying $2,500 (the value of U.S. assets determined under Step 1) by  the actual ratio for the taxable year. The actual ratio is the average  amount of FC's worldwide liabilities divided by the average value of  FC's worldwide assets. The amount of Liability 1 is $800, and the amount  of Liability 2 is $3,200. Thus, the numerator of the actual ratio is  $4,000. The average value of worldwide assets is $10,000 (Asset 1 +  Asset 2 + Asset 3). The actual ratio, therefore, is 40% ($4,000/ $10,000), and the amount of U.S.-connected liabilities for the taxable  year is $1,000 ($2,500 U.S. assets x 40%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Step 3. Because the amount of FC's U.S.-connected liabilities  ($1,000) exceeds the average total amount of U.S. booked liabilities of  B ($800), FC determines its interest expense in accordance with  paragraph (d)(5) of this section by adding the interest paid or accrued  on U.S. booked liabilities, and the interest expense associated with the  excess of its U.S.-connected liabilities over its average total amount  of U.S. booked liabilities. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section,  FC determines the interest rate attributable to its excess U.S.- connected liabilities by dividing the interest expense paid or accrued  by the average amount of U.S.-dollar denominated liabilities, which  produces an interest rate of 8% ($256/$3200). Therefore, FC's allocable  interest expense is $72 ($56 of interest expense from U.S. booked  liabilities plus $16 ($200x8%) of interest expense attributable to its  excess U.S.-connected liabilities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FC makes a fixed ratio  election under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The conclusions under  Step 1 are the same as in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of  U.S.-connected liabilities for the taxable year is determined by  multiplying $2,500 (the value of U.S. assets determined under Step 1) by  the fixed ratio for the taxable year, which, under paragraph (c)(4) of  this section is 50 percent. Thus, the amount of U.S.-connected  liabilities for the taxable year is $1,250 ($2,500 U.S. assets x 50%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3. As in Example 1, the amount of FC's U.S.-connected  liabilities exceed the average total amount of U.S. booked liabilities  of B, requiring FC to determine its interest expense under paragraph  (d)(5) of this section. In this case, however, FC has excess U.S.- connected liabilities of $450 ($1,250 of U.S.-connected liabilities-- $800 U.S. booked liabilities). FC therefore has allocable interest  expense of $92 ($56 of interest expense from U.S. booked liabilities  plus $36 ($450x8%) of interest expense attributable to its excess U.S.- connected liabilities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Bank Z, a resident of country  X, has a branch in the United States through which it conducts its  banking business. For the taxable year, Z has U.S.-connected  liabilities, determined under paragraph (c) of this section, equal to  $300. Z, however, has U.S. booked liabilities of $300 and U500.  Therefore, assuming an exchange rate of the U to the U.S. dollar of 5:1,  Z has U.S. booked liabilities of $400 ($300 + (U500 / 5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S.-connected liabilities. Because Z's U.S. booked liabilities  of $400 exceed its U.S.-connected liabilities by $100, all of Z's  interest expense allocable to its U.S. trade or business must be scaled  back pro-rata. To determine the scaling ratio, Z divides its U.S.- connected liabilities by its U.S. booked liabilities, as required by  paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Z's interest expense is scaled back  pro rata by the resulting ratio of \3/4\ ($300 / $400). Z's income,  expense, gain or loss from hedging transactions described in paragraph  (d)(2)(vi) of this section must be similarly reduced.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  Bank A, a resident of Country X maintains a banking office in the U.S.  that records transactions on three sets of books for State A, an  International Banking Facility (IBF) for its bank regulatory approved  international transactions, and a shell branch licensed operation in  Country C. Bank A records substantial ECI assets from its bank lending  and placement activities and a mix of interbranch and non-ECI producing  assets from the same or similar activities on the books of State A  branch and on its IBF. Bank A's Country C branch borrows substantially  from third parties, as well as from its home office, and lends all of  its funding to its State A branch and IBF to fund the mix of ECI,  interbranch and non-ECI activities on those two books. The consolidated  books of State A branch and IBF indicate that a substantial amount of  the total book assets constitute U.S. assets under paragraph (b) of this  section. Some of the third-party borrowings on the books of the State A  branch are used to lend directly   to Bank A's home office in Country X. These borrowings reflect the  average borrowing rate of the State A branch, IBF and Country C branches  as a whole. All third-party borrowings reflected on the books of State A  branch, the IBF and Country C branch were recorded on such books before  the close of business on the day the liabilities were acquired by Bank  A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S. booked liabilities. The facts demonstrate that the  separate State A branch, IBF and Country C branch books taken together,  constitute a set of books within the meaning of paragraph  (d)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section. Such set of books as a whole has a  direct relationship to an ECI activity under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)(2)  of this section even though the Country C branch books standing alone  would not. The third-party liabilities recorded on the books of Country  C constitute U.S. booked liabilities because they were timely recorded  and the overall set of books on which they were reflected has a direct  relationship to a bank lending and interbank placement ECI producing  activity. The third-party liabilities that were recorded on the books of  State A branch that were used to lend funds to Bank A's home office also  constitute U.S. booked liabilities because the interbranch activity the  funds were used for is a lending activity of a type that also gives rise  to a substantial amount of ECI that is properly reflected on the same  set of books as the interbranch loans. Accordingly, the liabilities are  not traced to their specific interbranch use but to the overall activity  of bank lending and interbank placements which gives rise to substantial  ECI. The facts show that the liabilities were not acquired to increase  artificially the interest expense of Bank A's U.S. booked liabilities as  a whole under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section. The third-party  liabilities also constitute U.S. booked liabilities for purposes of  determining Bank A's branch interest under Sec. 1.884-4(b)(1)(i)(A)  regardless of whether Bank A uses the Adjusted U.S. booked liability  method, or the Separate Currency Pool method to allocate its interest  expense under paragraph 5(e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Separate currency pools method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If a foreign  corporation elects to use the method in this paragraph, its total  interest expense allocable to ECI is the sum of the separate interest  deductions for each of the currencies in which the foreign corporation  has U.S. assets. The separate interest deductions are determined under  the following three-step process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the value of U.S. assets in each currency pool. First,  the foreign corporation must determine the amount of its U.S. assets,  using the methodology in paragraph (b) of this section, in each currency  pool. The foreign corporation may convert into U.S. dollars any currency  pool in which the foreign corporation holds less than 3% of its U.S.  assets. A transaction (or transactions) that hedges a U.S. asset shall  be taken into account for purposes of determining the currency  denomination and the value of the U.S. asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the U.S.-connected liabilities in each currency pool.  Second, the foreign corporation must determine the amount of its U.S.- connected liabilities in each currency pool by multiplying the amount of  U.S. assets (as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section) in  the currency pool by the foreign corporation's actual ratio (as  determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) for the taxable year  or, if the taxpayer has made an election in accordance with paragraph  (c)(4) of this section, by the fixed ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the interest expense attributable to each currency  pool. Third, the foreign corporation must determine the interest expense  attributable to each currency pool by multiplying the U.S.-connected  liabilities in each currency pool by the prescribed interest rate as  defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prescribed interest rate. For each currency pool, the prescribed  interest rate is determined by dividing the total interest expense that  is paid or accrued for the taxable year with respect to the foreign  corporation's worldwide liabilities denominated in that currency, by the  foreign corporation's average worldwide liabilities (whether interest  bearing or not) denominated in that currency. The interest expense and  liabilities are to be stated in that currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Hedging transactions.

The separate currency pools method of this paragraph  (e) is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Bank Z, a  resident of country X, has a branch in the United States through which  it conducts its banking business. For its 1997 taxable year, Z has U.S.  assets, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, that are  denominated in U.S. dollars and in U, the country X currency.  Accordingly, Z's U.S. assets are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Average</p><p class="depth0">value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ U.S. Dollar Assets...........................................    $20,000 U Assets.....................................................    U 5,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Z's worldwide liabilities are also denominated in U.S. Dollars  and in U. The average interest rates on Z's worldwide liabilities,  including those in the United States, are 6% on its U.S. dollar  liabilities, and 12% on its liabilities denominated in U. Assume that Z  has properly elected to use its actual ratio of 95% to determine its  U.S.-connected liabilities in Step 2, and has also properly elected to  use the separate currency pools method provided in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of interest expense. Z determines the interest  expense attributable to its U.S.-connected liabilities according to the  steps described below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First, Z separates its U.S. assets into two currency pools, one  denominated in U.S. dollars ($20,000) and the other denominated in U  (U5,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Second, Z multiplies each pool of assets by the applicable ratio  of worldwide liabilities to assets, which in this case is 95%. Thus, Z  has U.S.-connected liabilities of $19,000 ($20,000x95%), and U4750  (U5000x95%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Third, Z calculates its interest expense by multiplying each  pool of its U.S.-connected liabilities by the relevant interest rates.  Accordingly, Z's allocable interest expense for the year is $1140  ($19,000x6%), the sum of the expense associated with its U.S. dollar  liabilities, plus U570 (U4750x12%), the interest expense associated with  its liabilities denominated in U. Z must translate its interest expense  denominated in U in accordance with the rules provided in section 988,  and then must determine whether it is subject to any other provision of  the Code that would disallow or defer any portion of its interest  expense so determined.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.
