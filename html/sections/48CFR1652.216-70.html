                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in section 1616.7001, the following clause shall be  inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on a combination of cost and price  analysis (community rated).</p><p class="depth0">Accounting and Price Adjustment (JAN 2003)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual Accounting Statement. The Carrier, not later than 90 days  after the end of each contract period, shall furnish to OPM for that  contract period an accounting of its operations under the contract. The  accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This contract is community rated as defined in  FEHBAR 1602.170-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>  of this clause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall meet the  FEHB-specific MLR threshold as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-14. The ratio  of a plan's incurred claims, including the carrier's expenditures for  activities that improve health care quality, to total premium revenue  shall not be lower than the FEHB-specific MLR threshold published  annually by OPM in its rate instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall be  equivalent to the subscription rates given to the carrier's similarly  sized subscriber group (SSSG) as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-13. The  subscription rates shall be determined according to the carrier's  established policy, which must be applied consistently to the FEHBP and  to the carrier's SSSG. If the SSSG receives a rate lower than that  determined according to the carrier's established policy, it is  considered a discount. The FEHBP must receive a discount equal to or  greater than the carrier's SSSG discount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, then:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription  rates are found to be lower than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the  carrier may include an adjustment to the Federal group's rates for the  next contract period, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this  clause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription  rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the  carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by reducing the FEHB  rates for the next contract term to reflect the difference between the  estimated rates and the rates which are derived using the methodology of  the SSSG, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the  FEHBP that are not given to the SSSG. Any such guaranteed discounts must  be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of  the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP  discounts may not be adjusted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If rates are determined by comparison with the FEHB-specific MLR  threshold, then if the MLR for the carrier's FEHB plan is found to be  lower than the published FEHB-specific MLR threshold, the carrier must  pay a subsidization penalty equal to the difference into a subsidization  penalty account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following apply to community rated plans, regardless of the  rating methodology:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No upward adjustment in the rate established for this contract  will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the  Carrier in this or in any other contract period on the basis of actual  costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition  of the FEHBP group during this contract period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in  the event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation  will be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM.  Any amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the  contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the  terminating year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based  on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use  surcharges in the rate reconciliation process in any circumstance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the  event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation will  be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM. Any  amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the  contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the  terminating year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the  FEHBP. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as  guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which  the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based  on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use  surcharges in the rate reconciliation process. If the carrier is subject  to the SSSG rules and imposes a surcharge on the   SSSG, the carrier cannot impose the surcharge on FEHB.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)  [62 FR 47577, Sept. 10, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 36273, July 6, 1999;  65 FR 36387, June 8, 2000; 70 FR 31383, June 1, 2005; 74 FR 7824, Feb.  20, 2009; 76 FR 38286, June 29, 2011; 77 FR 19525, Apr. 2, 2012; 80 FR  32861, June 10, 2015]</p>
