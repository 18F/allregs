Sec. 1.9003-1  Election to have the provisions of section 613(c) (2)and (4) of the 1954 Code, as amended, apply for past years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 4 of the Act of September 14, 1960 (Pub. L. 86-781, 74 Stat. 1017), amended section 302(c) of the Public Debt and Tax Rate Extension Act of 1960 to permit certain taxpayers for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, to apply the provisions of section 302(b) of that Act. Section 302(b) of the Act amended section 613(c) (2) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to read in part as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 613. Percentage Depletion. * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of gross income from property. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mining. The term ``mining'' includes not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground but also the treatment processes considered as mining described in paragraph (4) (and the treatment processes necessary or incidental thereto), and so much of the transportation of ores or minerals (whether or not by common carrier) from the point of extraction from the ground to the plants or mills in which such treatment processes are applied thereto as is not in excess of 50 miles unless the Secretary or his delegate finds that the physical and other requirements are such that the ore or mineral must be transported a greater distance to such plants or mills.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment processes considered as mining. The following treatment processes where applied by the mine owner or operator shall be considered as mining to the extent they are applied to the ore or mineral in respect of which he is entitled to a deduction for depletion under section 611:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In the case of calcium carbonates and other minerals when used in making cement--all processes (other than preheating of the kiln feed) applied prior to the introduction of the kiln feed into the kiln, but not including any subsequent process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election. Under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, the taxpayer, in the case of calcium carbonates or other minerals when used by him in making cement, may elect to apply the provisions of section 613(c) (2) and (4) of the 1954 Code as amended in lieu of the corresponding provisions of prior law. The taxpayer must make the election in accordance with Sec. 1.9003-4 on or before November 15, 1960, and the election shall become irrevocable on November 15, 1960.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Years to which the election is applicable. If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of section 613(c) (2) and (4) as amended by section 302(b) of the Act apply to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The assessment of any deficiency,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Refund or credit of any overpayment,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
is not prevented on September 14, 1960, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election also applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 14, 1960.

Sec. 1.9003-2  Effect of election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9003-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of section 302(b) of the Act with respect to all taxable years to which the election applies. Thus, subparagraph (F) of section 613(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended must be applied in determining gross income from mining for the taxable years to which the election applies (including years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue. Further, the election shall apply to all calcium carbonates or other minerals mined and used by the taxpayer in making cement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect on gross income from mining. The election is only determinative of what constitutes ``mining'' for purposes of computing percentage depletion and has no effect on the method employed in determining the amount

of gross income from mining. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of section 302(b) of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code.
[T.D. 6492, 25 FR 8905, Sept. 16, 1960]


Sec. 1.9003-3  Statutes of limitation.</p><p class="depth0">Under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, the period within which the assessment of any deficiency or the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made shall not expire sooner than 1 year after November 15, 1960. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, is not prevented on September 14, 1960, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least 1 year after November 15, 1960, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. Even though assessment of a deficiency is prevented on September 14, 1960, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Code may be made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time within 1 year after November 15, 1960. If the taxpayer makes the election he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of section 302(c)(2) of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. Section 302(c)(2) of the Act does not shorten the period of limitations otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Code and corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for assessment.

Sec. 1.9003-4  Manner of exercising election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By whom election is to be made. Generally, the taxpayer whose tax liability is affected by the election shall make the election. In the case of a partnership, or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election shall be exercised by the partnership or such corporation, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election shall be made on or before November 15, 1960, by filing a statement with the district director with whom the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. The statement shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A clear indication that an election is being made under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxable years to which the election applies.

Amended income tax returns reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporations, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than February 28, 1961, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Code. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended returns. The amended returns shall be accompanied by payment of the additional tax (together with interest thereon) resulting from the election.
[T.D. 6492, 25 FR 8905, Sept. 16, 1960]



Sec. 1.9003-5  Terms; applicability of other laws.</p><p class="depth0">All other terms which are not otherwise specifically defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended to the contrary. Further, all provisions of law contained in the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent that they can apply. Thus, all of the provisions of subtitle F of the Code and the corresponding provisions of prior law shall apply to the extent they can apply, including the provisions of law relating to assessment, collection, credit or refund, and limitations. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.9003-1 to 1.9003-4, inclusive, the term ``Act'' means the Public Debt and Tax Rate Extension Act of 1960 as amended (74 Stat. 293, 1018).
