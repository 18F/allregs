                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Programs approved in Sec. 274.6(b) must be those as described on the pesticide label. Pesticide uses which are different from the registered use, require amendment of the label, approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Data requirements for this use must be supplied before an amendment will be made by the Agency. Substantial time and effort are required for such action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an unexpected outbreak of a pest requires control measures which are not according to the registered use, such control effort is viewed as an emergency measure and may be undertaken at the discretion of the Division Engineer. An emergency will be deemed to exist when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pest outbreak has or is about to occur and no pesticide registered for the particular use, or alternative method of control, is available to eradicate or control the pest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Significant economic or health problems will occur without the use of the pesticide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time available from discovery or prediction of the pest outbreak is insufficient for a pesticide to be registered for the particular use. In determining whether an emergency condition exists, the Administrator will also give consideration to such additional facts requiring the use of Section 18 Sec. 274.3(a) as are presented by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emergency operations should be documented by a request for a specific exemption, prepared by the District and forwarded through channels to HQDA (DAEN-CWO-R) WASH DC 20314 for transmittal to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each specific exemption must be requested in writing, by the head of the Federal agency or the Governor of the State involved, or other official designee, addressed to the Administator, setting forth the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature, scope and frequency of the emergency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the pest known to occur, the places or times it may be likely to occur and the estimated time when treatment must be commenced to be effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether a pesticide registered for the particular use, or other method of eradicating or controlling the pest, is available to meet the emergency, and the basis for such determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A listing of the pesticide or pesticides the agency proposes to use in the event of an outbreak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Description of the nature of the program for eradication or control. Such description should include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Quantity of the pesticide expected to be applied;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Specific Area or place of application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Method of application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Duration of application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Qualifications of personnel involved in such application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Statement of economic benefits and losses anticipated with and without the exemption and under reasonable alternatives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Analysis of possible adverse effects on man and the environment. If an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared by an agency, in accordance with that agency's regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and is relevant to the above, it shall be submitted with the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Such exemptions, if granted, are valid only for the specific situation involved and are subject to such restrictions as the Administrator may prescribe in granting the exemption. Such restrictions may include, among others, limitations on the quantity of the pesticide to be used, the conditions under which the pesticide may be applied, restrictions as to the person who may apply the pesticide and the type of monitoring activities which should be conducted. Within one year of the granting of the exemption, a summary report on what action was taken to meet the emergency and on the outcome of such action, must be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-CWO-R) WASH DC 20314, for forwarding to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 274--Preventive Safety Measures in Handling of</p><p class="depth0">Pesticides</p><p class="depth0">1. Follow the label on each container before using the contents. The manufacturers are required by law to list recommendations and precautions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Weather conditions are important. Winds could carry toxic sprays and dusts to areas not under your control, causing accidental poisoning to the public or domestic animals.</p><p class="depth0">3. Smoking is not permitted while pesticides are being handled.</p><p class="depth0">4. All pesticides must be handled in well-vetilated areas to minimize inhalation of toxic vapors.</p><p class="depth0">5. Shower and washing facilities must be near pesticide mixing areas.</p><p class="depth0">6. Any contamination of skin, particularly with liquid concentrations or solutions, must be immediately washed off with detergent and water.</p><p class="depth0">7. Protective clothing is used in conjunction with respiratory protective devised to prevent skin contact and inhalation of pesticides. Recommended articles of protective clothing are rubber aprons, coveralls, chemical splash goggles, safety shoes, and hard hats. A lightweight water and chemical resistant throw away type protective clothing that is impervious to herbicides is now available. In warm geographical areas this type of lightweight protective clothing would be

beneficial in reducing physical stress to applicators. Additional protection is afforded by protective skin cream.</p><p class="depth0">8. Clothing contaminated by spillage must be removed immediately and thoroughly laundered before wearing. Special care is required to prevent contamination of the inside of gloves.</p><p class="depth0">9. Approved respirators must be worn while pesticides are being mixed, and when dusts or liquids are being handled or sprayed. Care should be exercised when selecting the respirator type to insure that it is designated specifically for the substance to be used. Each respirator must be labeled and approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or NIOSH. Filters or canisters must be changed after 8 hours use and more often if odor of the pesticide is detected. (Always have extra cartridges available when needed).</p><p class="depth0">10. Pesticide storage, mixing, and formulation facilities:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All pesticides must be stored in a dry, well ventilated, separate room, building, or covered area not accessible to unauthorized personnel or the public and placed under lock and key.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification signs should be placed on rooms, buildings, and fences to advise of the contents and warn of their hazardous nature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where applicable, the outside of each storage area should be labeled with ``Danger,'' ``Poison,'' and ``Pesticide Storage'' signs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fire extinguishers must be installed near the door of materiel storage rooms. Diluted oil based pesticides are flammable and must be stored separate from other materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All pesticide storage, mixing, and formulation areas must have adequate ventilation in order to reduce inhalation of toxic vapors. Sparkproof lighting fixtures should be installed in closed storage areas to eliminate ignition hazards.</p><p class="depth2">11. Empty pesticide containers must be disposed of properly. Do not burn them. When herbicides or defoliants volatilize the resulting vapors may be poisonous to humans, and they may damage nearby plants, crops, or shrubbery; also, pesticides or defoliants containing chlorates may be a serious fire hazard when heated.</p><p class="depth2">12. Glass pesticide containers should be disposed of by breaking. Chop holes in top, bottom, and sides of metal containers or crush them so they cannot collect water or be reused. After breaking or puncturing them, bury the containers at least 18 inches deep in an isolated area provided for this purpose, away from water supplies or high water tables. Records to locate such buried pesticides within the landfill site should be maintained. Post warning signs.</p><p class="depth2">13. Safety programs developed for the safe handling and mixing of toxic chemicals should be coordinated with the Safety Office prior to implementation.</p>
