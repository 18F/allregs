                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data on the chronic toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures (``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes a chronic toxicity test in which daphnids are exposed to a chemical in a renewal or a flow-through system. The United States Environmental Protection Agency will use data from this test in assessing the hazard a chemical may present to the aquatic environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and the definitions in part 792 Good Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter apply to this test guideline. In addition, the following definitions apply to this guideline:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Brood stock means the animals which are cultured to produce test organisms through reproduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chronic toxicity test means a method used to determine the concentration of a substance in water that produces an adverse effect on a test organism over an extended period of time. In this test guideline, mortality and reproduction (and optionally, growth) are the criteria of toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EC50 means that experimentally derived concentration of test substance in dilution water that is calculated to affect 50 percent of a test population during continuous exposure over a specified period of time. In this guideline, the effect measured is immobilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ephippium means a resting egg which develops under the carapace in response to stress conditions in daphnids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Flow-through means a continuous or intermittent passage of test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or culture tank with no recycling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Immobilization means the lack of movement by daphnids except for minor activity of the appendages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Loading means the ratio of daphnid biomass (grams, wet weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber at a point in time or passing through the test chamber during a specific interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> MATC (Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration) means the maximum concentration at which a chemical can be present and not be toxic to the test organism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Renewal system means the technique in which test organisms are periodically transferred to fresh test solution of the same composition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) Test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. In the flow-through test the flow of dilution water through each chamber is then adjusted to the rate desired. The test substance is introduced into each test chamber. The addition of test substance in the flow-through system is done at a rate which is sufficient to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in the test chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Summary of the test.

The addition of test substance in the flow-through system is done at a rate which is sufficient to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in the test chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The test is started within 30 minutes after the test substance has been added and uniformly distributed in the test chambers in the renewal test or after the concentration of test substance in each test chamber of the flow-through test system reaches the

prescribed level and remains stable. At the initiation of the test, daphnids which have been cultured or acclimated in accordance with the test design, are randomly placed into the test chambers. Daphnids in the test chambers are observed periodically during the test, immobile adults and offspring produced are counted and removed, and the findings are recorded. Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, the concentration of test substance, and other water quality parameters are measured at specified intervals in selected test chambers. Data are collected during the test to determine any significant differences (p<=0.05) in immobilization and reproduction as compared to the control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Range-finding test.

An equal number of daphnids shall be placed in two or more replicates. The concentration ranges shall be selected to determine the concentration-response curves, EC50 values and MATC. Solutions shall be analyzed for chemical concentration at designated times during the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Every test shall include controls consisting of the same dilution water, conditions, procedures and daphnids from the same population (culture container), except that none of the chemical is added.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The test duration is 21 days. The test is unacceptable if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> More than 20 percent of the control organisms appear to be immobilized, stressed or diseased during the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each control daphnid living the full 21 days produces an average of less than 60 young.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any ephippia are produced by control animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The number of immobilized daphnids in each chamber shall be recorded on day 21 of the test. After offspring are produced, they shall be counted and removed from the test chambers every 2 or 3 days.

An MATC shall be determined for the most sensitive test criteria measured (number of adult animals immobilized, number of young per adult, and number of immobilized young per adult).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In addition to immobility, any abnormal behavior or appearance shall also be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing area shall be positioned in a random manner as in a way in which appropriate statistical analyses can be used to determine the variation due to placement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Analytical measurements. (i) Test chemical. Deionized water should be used in making stock solutions of the test substance. Standard analytical methods should be used whenever available in performing the analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test substance in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by appropriate laboratory practices.

The number of immobilized adults, total offspring per adult, and immobilized offspring per adult shall be counted during each test. Appropriate statistical analyses should provide a goodness-of-fit determination for the adult immobilization concentration-response curves calculated on day 21. A 21-day EC50 based on adult immobilization and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals shall also be calculated. Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., analysis of variance, mean separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical effects on chronic test criteria (cumulative number of immobilized adults, cumulative number of offspring per adult and cumulative number of immobilized offspring per adult) on day 21. An MATC shall be calculated using these chronic test criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection.

All treatments and control(s) shall receive, as near as reasonably possible, the same ration of food on a per-animal basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The food concentration depends on the type used. Food concentrations should be sufficient to support normal growth and development and to allow for asexual (parthenogenic) reproduction. For automatic feeding devices, a suggested rate is 5 to 7 mg food (either solids or algal cells, dry weight) per liter dilution water or test solution. For manual once-a-day feeding, a suggested rate is 15 mg food (dry weight) per liter dilution water or test solution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Loading. The number of test organisms placed in a test chamber shall not affect test results. Loading shall not exceed 40 daphnids per liter in the renewal system.

When handling is necessary it should be done as gently, carefully, and quickly as possible. During culturing and acclimation, daphnids should be observed carefully for ephippia and other signs of stress, physical damage, and mortality. Dead and abnormal individuals shall be discarded. Organisms that touch dry surfaces or are dropped or injured during handling shall be discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Smooth glass tubes (I.D. greater than 5mm) equipped with a rubber bulb can be used for transferring daphnids with minimal culture media carry-over.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Care should be exercised to introduce the daphnids below the surface of any solution so as not to trap air under the carapace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Acclimation. (A) Brood daphnids shall be maintained in 100 percent dilution water at the test temperature for at least 48 hours prior to the start of the test.
