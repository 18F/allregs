A member may initiate a new request when such member's retired pay is restored in an amount sufficient to satisfy the withholding request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A State requesting an agreement for the voluntary withholding of State tax from the retired pay of members of the Uniformed Services shall indicate, in writing, its agreement to be bound by the provisions of this part. If the State proposes an agreement that varies from the Standard Agreement, the State shall indicate which provisions of the Standard Agreement are not acceptable and propose substitute provisions.
