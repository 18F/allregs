                                Sec. 890.307  Waiver or suspension of annuity or compensation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section,  when annuity or compensation is entirely waived or suspended, the  annuitant's enrollment continues for not more than 3 months (not more  than 12 weeks for annuitants whose compensation under subchapter I of  chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, is paid each 4 weeks). If the  waiver or suspension continues beyond this period, the employing office  will notify the annuitant in writing that the employing office will  terminate the enrollment effective at the end of the period, subject to  the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, unless the annuitant  elects to make payment of the premium directly to the employing office  during the period of waiver. If the annuitant elects to have the  enrollment terminated, the employing office automatically reinstates the  enrollment on a prospective basis when the annuitant again receives  payment of annuity or compensation. The employing office will make the  withholding for the period of waiver or suspension during which  enrollment was continued (i.e., 3 months or less).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the annuitant elects to pay premiums directly, he or she must  send to the employing office his or her share of the subscription charge  for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment  continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for  conversion provided in Sec. 890.401. The annuitant must pay after each  pay period he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule  established by the employing office. If the employing office does not  receive payment by the date due, the employing office must notify the  annuitant in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment  being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants residing overseas)  after receipt of the notice. If no further payments are made, the  employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date of the  notice (90 days for annuitants residing overseas). The employing office  automatically reinstates enrollment on a prospective basis when payment  of annuity or compensation resumes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the annuitant is prevented by circumstances beyond his or her  control from paying within 15 days after receipt of the notice, he or  she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the employing  office. The annuitant must file the request within 30 calendar days from  the date of termination, and must include supporting documentation. The  employing office will determine if the annuitant is eligible for  reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative,  reinstate the coverage of the annuitant retroactive to the date of  termination. If the determination is negative, the annuitant may request  a review of the decision as provided in Sec. 890.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the  time frame established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section  is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which the employing  office timely received payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The employing office will submit all direct premium payments  along with its regular health benefits premiums to OPM in accordance  with procedures established by OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If suspension of annuity or compensation is because of  reemployment, the reemploying office must make the withholding currently  and enrollment continues during reemployment.
