                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Legal services defined. The term ``legal services'' means  services of the kind usually performed by attorneys for private persons  and includes such acts as the drawing up of wills, powers of attorney,  or other legal instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance usually prohibited--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General prohibition;  exceptions. Officers of the Foreign Service should not perform legal  services except when instructed to do so by the Secretary of State, or  in cases of sudden emergency when the interests of the United States  Government, might be involved, or in cases in which no lawyer is  available and refusal to perform the service would result in the  imposition of extreme hardship upon a United States citizen. There is no  objection, however, to permitting persons to use the legal references in  the Foreign Service office giving specimen forms of wills, powers of  attorney, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific prohibitions and restrictions. See Sec. 72.41 of this  chapter for prohibition of performance of legal services by consular  officers in connection with decedents' estates. See Sec. 92.11  restricting the preparation for private parties of legal documents for  signature and notarization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceptance of will for deposit prohibited. Wills shall not be  accepted for safekeeping in the office safe. If a person desires to have  his last will and testament made a matter of record in a Foreign Service  establishment, the officer to whom application is made shall have the  will copied in the Miscellaneous Record Book (Sec. 92.77) and charge  the prescribed fee therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refusal of requests. In refusing requests for the performance of  legal   services, an officer of the Foreign Service should cite these  regulations and should state clearly his reasons for refusing to act. In  appropriate cases, the officer may furnish the inquirer with a copy of  the annual list of attorneys (see Sec. 92.82) practicing in the  consular district or he may refer the inquirer to the Department for a  list of attorneys.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of responsibility. When an officer of the Foreign Service  accedes to a request for the performance of a legal service, he should  inform the applicant that the service is performed at the latter's risk  and without any responsibility on the part of the United States  Government or the officer performing the service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees. No fee should be charged for any legal services which may  be performed under these regulations, beyond the fees or charges for  specific services enumerated in the Tariff of Fees, Foreign Service of  the United States of America (Sec. 22.1 of this chapter).</p>
