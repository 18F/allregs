                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator shall perform an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) on processes covered by this part. The process hazard analysis shall be appropriate to the complexity of the process and shall identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the process. The owner or operator shall determine and document the priority order for conducting process hazard analyses based on a rationale which includes such considerations as extent of the process hazards, number of potentially affected employees, age of the process, and operating history of the process. The process hazard analysis shall be conducted as soon as possible, but not later than June 21, 1999. Process hazards analyses completed to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) are acceptable as initial process hazards analyses. These process hazard analyses shall be updated and revalidated, based on their completion date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator shall use one or more of the following methodologies that are appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> What-If;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Checklist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> What-If/Checklist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fault Tree Analysis; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An appropriate equivalent methodology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The process hazard analysis shall address:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hazards of the process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases.

Also, one member of the team must be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator shall establish a system to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be taken; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> At least every five (5) years after the completion of the initial process hazard analysis, the process hazard

analysis shall be updated and revalidated by a team meeting the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, to assure that the process hazard analysis is consistent with the current process. Updated and revalidated process hazard analyses completed to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) are acceptable to meet the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The owner or operator shall retain process hazards analyses and updates or revalidations for each process covered by this section, as well as the documented resolution of recommendations described in paragraph (e) of this section for the life of the process.</p>
