                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing. Documents to be filed with the Commission must comply  with applicable rules, including Sec. 201.8 of this chapter. If the  Commission establishes a deadline for the filing of a document, and the  submitter includes confidential business information in the document,  the submitter is to file the confidential version on or before the  deadline date and may file the nonconfidential version no later than one  business day after the deadline for filing the document. If the  submitter is a party, the submitter is to serve the nonconfidential  version of the document on other parties on the service list no later  than one business day after the deadline for filing the document. The  confidential version filed with the Commission shall enclose all  confidential business information in brackets and have the following  warning marked on every page: ``Bracketing of CBI not final for one  business day after date of filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one  business day after the date of filing of the document, i.e., at the same  time as the nonconfidential version of the document is due to be filed.  If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, the  submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the confidential  document at the same time as the nonconfidential version is filed. No  changes to the document other than bracketing and deletion of  confidential business information are permitted after the deadline.  Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the striking of all  or a portion of a submitter's document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service. Any party submitting a document for the consideration  of the Commission in the course of an investigation to which this part  pertains shall, in addition to complying with Sec. 201.8 of this  chapter, serve a copy of the public version of such document on all  other parties to the investigation in the manner prescribed in Sec.  201.16 of this chapter. If a document is filed before the Secretary's  issuance of the service list provided for in Sec. 201.11 of this  chapter, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of  service, but the document shall be served on all appropriate parties  within two (2) days of the issuance of the service list and a  certificate of service shall then be filed. Notwithstanding Sec. 201.16  of this chapter, petitions, briefs, and testimony filed by parties shall  be served by hand or, if served by mail, by overnight mail or its  equivalent. Failure to comply with the requirements of this rule may  result in removal from status as a   party to the investigation. The Commission shall make available, upon  request, to all parties to the investigation a copy of each document,  except transcripts of hearings, confidential business information,  privileged information, and information required to be served under this  section, placed in the docket file of the investigation by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification. Any person submitting factual information on  behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party for the  consideration of the Commission in the course of an investigation to  which this part pertains, and any person submitting a response to a  Commission questionnaire issued in connection with an investigation to  which this part pertains, must certify that such information is accurate  and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge.</p>
