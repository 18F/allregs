                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A hip joint metal/polymer constrained cemented  or uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace  a hip joint. The device prevents dislocation   in more than one anatomic plane and has components that are linked  together. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have a  femoral component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum,  and an acetabular component made of ultra-high-molecular-weight  polyethylene with or without a metal shell, made of alloys, such as  cobalt-chromium-molybdenum and titanium alloys. This generic type of  device is intended for use with or without bone cement (Sec. 888.3027).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control  for this device is the FDA guidance document entitled ``Class II Special  Controls Guidance: Hip Joint Metal/Polymer Constrained Cemented or  Uncemented Prosthesis.''
