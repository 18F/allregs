                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BPT:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The limitation for BOD5 is the same as specified in Sec. 439.12(a). No facility shall be required to attain a monthly average limitation for BOD5 that is less than the equivalent of 45 mg/L.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The long-term average daily BOD5 load of the raw process wastewater (i.e., the base number to which the percent reduction is applied) is defined as the average daily BOD5 load during any calendar month, over 12 consecutive months within the most recent 36 months, and must include one or more periods during which production was at a maximum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To assure equity in the determination of NPDES permit limitations regulating discharges subject to this subpart, calculation of the long-term average daily BOD5 load in the influent to the wastewater treatment system must exclude any portion of the load associated with separable mycelia and solvents, except for residual amounts of mycelia and solvents remaining after the practices of recovery and/or separate disposal or reuse. Residual amounts of these substances may be included in the calculation of the average influent BOD5 loading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The practices of recovery, and/or separate disposal or reuse include: physical separation and removal of separable mycelia; recovery of solvents from wastestreams; incineration of concentrated solvent wastestreams (including tar still bottoms); and broth concentration for disposal other than to the treatment system. This part does not prohibit the inclusion of such wastes in raw waste loads in fact, nor does it mandate any specific practice, but rather describes the rationale for determining NPDES permit limitations. The effluent limitation for BOD5 may be achieved by any of several, or a combination, of these practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The limitation for TSS is the same as specified in Sec. 439.12(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for the provisions in paragraph (d) of this section, the limitations for COD are as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Effluent Limitations (BPT)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Maximum</p><p class="depth2">Maximum    monthly</p><p class="depth2">Regulated parameter                 daily \1\   average</p><p class="depth2">\1\------------------------------------------------------------------------COD...............................................        228        86------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ mg/L (ppm)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the maximum monthly average COD concentration in paragraph (c) of this section is higher than a concentration value reflecting a reduction in the long-term average daily COD load in the raw (untreated) process wastewater of 74 percent multiplied by a variability factor of 2.2, then a monthly average limitation for COD corresponding to the lower concentration value must be applied.
