                            <p class="depth0">The records of all existing employees and applicants for positions in child care services are reviewed by the Component designee according to the procedures prescribed in appendix A to this part.


Sec. Appendix A to Part 86--Criminal History Background Check Procedures</p><p class="depth0">This appendix establishes the procedures for conducting criminal history background checks on existing and newly hired individuals required by Public Law 101-647, section 231 and Public Law 102-190, section 1094. Background checks are required for all civilian providers involved in child care services who have regular contact with children. The categories of providers include current and prospective individuals hired with APF and NAFI funds for education, treatment or healthcare, child care or youth activities, and individuals employed under contract involved in the provision of child care services. In addition to the mandates of Public Law 102-190, section 1094, the Department of Defense requires that military members (except healthcare personnel), foster or respite care providers, FCC providers and family members, and specified volunteers shall have checks specified in this part.</p><p class="depth0">A. Conducting Checks</p><p class="depth0">Component designees shall notify existing and newly hired individuals and contractors of the requirement for a review of personnel and security records to include an FBI fingerprint check and SCHR checks of residences listed on employment and security applications.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fingerprint Check. Law enforcement personnel shall forward completed forms through channels to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or Defense Investigative Service (DIS) for processing of FBI fingerprint forms.</p><p class="depth0">2. State Criminal History Repository (SCHR) Check. DoD Installation-level personnel offices, in collaboration with law enforcement and security personnel, shall process State criminal history background checks for employment and shall ordinarily communicate in writing with each State identified in appendix B to part 86, providing full identifying information on each applicant and request confirmation that the individual has not been convicted in that State of a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, a drug felony, or a violent crime. The DoD Component Heads may establish alternate procedures for conducting SCHR checks; e.g., a computerized, written, or telephonic check. The DoD Components are not required to wait longer than 60 days from the date of the request for a response from the SCHR personnel before taking action on a particular application. Authorities will depend on FBI fingerprint check validation if States do not respond.</p><p class="depth0">3. Installation Record Checks (IRC). Consists of a local record check on an individual for a minimum of 2 years before the date of the application. This record check shall include, at a minimum, police (base and/or military police, security office, criminal investigators, or local law enforcement) local files checks, Drug and Alcohol Program, Family Housing, Medical Treatment Facility for Family Advocacy Program Service Central Registry records and mental health records, and any other record checks as appropriate to the extent permitted by law. A Service DCII may be conducted. The IRC shall be conducted by DoD Component personnel at the installation level. An IRC will be completed on individuals with a DoD affiliation such as living or working on an installation or is active duty member or family member. Individuals without DoD affiliation have no installation system of records to check and an IRC is not completed. Upon favorable completion of the IRC, an individual may be selected and provide child care services under line of sight supervision until the required background checks are completed.</p><p class="depth0">B. Applicants</p><p class="depth0">1. Appropriated Fund (APF) Applicants</p><p class="depth0">a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the DoD Components shall process APF applicants using currently established procedures for completing background checks described in 32 CFR part 310. APF applicants must complete a SF-171, ``Application for Federal Employment,'' and attach an SF-87, ``Fingerprint Chart,'' completed by a law enforcement officer; and an SF-85P, ``Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions'' (Annotate Block ``B'' with code 03), for conduct of a NACI. The package shall be forwarded to the OPM.</p><p class="depth0">b. The DoD Components shall assign responsibility for conducting the criminal history background checks through the SCHR to personnel offices working with law enforcement or investigative agencies. They shall conduct checks in all States that an employee or prospective employee lists as current and former residences in an employment or security application. It is deemed unnecessary to conduct checks before 18 years of age because juvenile records are unavailable. If no response is received from the State(s) within 60 days, determinations based upon the FBI report may be made. Responses received after this determination has been made must be provided to the determining authority.</p><p class="depth0">c. Under Public Law 102-190, section 1094, the DoD Components may employ an individual pending completion of successful background checks described in Public Law 101-647, section 231. If an individual is so employed, at all times while children are in the care of that individual, he or she must be within sight and under the supervision of an individual whose background checks have been completed, with no derogatory reports.</p><p class="depth0">d. Once it is clear that no derogatory information exists, line of sight supervision is terminated by the designee. If a derogatory report exists, Component personnel procedures shall prescribe appropriate action consistent with the criteria contained in this part.</p><p class="depth0">2. Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Applicants</p><p class="depth0">a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the DoD Components shall process NAFI applicants following established procedures for completing background checks. NAFI applicants must complete a DD Form 398-2 ``Department of Defense National Agency Questionnaire,'' with reason for request identified as OTHER and annotated as CHILD CARE, and FD Form 258, ``FBI Applicant Fingerprint Card.'' Fingerprints shall be taken by the local law enforcement organization personnel and together with the DD Form 398-2 shall be forwarded to: Defense Investigative Service, Personnel Investigations Center, P.O. Box 1083, Baltimore, MD 21203-1083.</p><p class="depth0">b. The DoD Components shall follow the procedures in the FPM, Chapter 731 and 736 and in paragraph B.1.b.,c., and d. of this appendix to obtain fingerprints for the FBI, conduct criminal history background checks through the SCHR, and maintain employment of individuals pending the successful completion of the background checks.</p><p class="depth0">3. Foreign National Employees Overseas</p><p class="depth0">Foreigh national employees overseas, while not expressly included within the law, are subject to the following record checks or those equivalent in scope to checks conducted on U.S. citizens:</p><p class="depth0">a. Host-government law enforcement and security agency checks at the city, State (province), and national level, whenever permissible by the laws of the host government.</p><p class="depth0">b. Defense Central Investigative Index (DCII).</p><p class="depth0">c. FBI checks (when information exists regarding residence by the individual in the United States for 1 year or more since age 18).</p><p class="depth0">d. When permissible by the laws of the host government, host-government checks are requested directly by the employing Service or agency. As an alternative, the DoD Components may request that overseas Military Service investigative elements obtain appropriate host-government checks. Where host-nations' arrangements preclude comparable criminal history checks, foreign nationals will not be eligible for employment in child care services.</p><p class="depth0">4. Temporary Employees</p><p class="depth0">This category includes summer hires, student interns, and NAFI flexible category employees. Background checks for these individuals are processed according to funding source; i.e., for APF employees (to OPM) or NAFI employees (to DIS). Installation designated points of contact shall notify applicants of report disposition.</p><p class="depth0">5. Healthcare Personnel</p><p class="depth0">This category includes civilian personnel involved in the delivery of healthcare. Within the context of such medical care, line of sight supervision must be viewed through the prism of existing medical quality assurance, clinical privileging, and licensure directives, which require pre-employment screens, enhanced surveillance of new employees, and ongoing monitoring of the performance of all healthcare providers. These programs are inherent to both quality medical care and patient safety and are adequate and equivalent mechanisms for the sight and supervision requirements in paragraph B.1.c. and d. of this appendix. It should be noted

that these quality assurance programs are not sufficient in and of themselves under Public Law 101-647, section 231. Therefore, the required FBI fingerprint check and the SCHR check must be completed as expeditiously as possible.</p><p class="depth0">C. Current Employees</p><p class="depth0">All currently employed individuals covered by this part shall have the FBI fingerprint and criminal history background check as described in Public Law 101-647, section 231. If the results of such checks, to include the SCHR, cannot be confirmed through an examination of available local records, action shall be initiated in accordance with paragraph B.1. of this appendix for APF employees and paragraph B.2. of this appendix for NAFI employees, and with paragraph D. of this appendix for individuals employed under contract. The SCHR checks are conducted in all cases in accordance with paragraph A.2. of this appendix. For the purposes of this part, no IRC is required for individuals employed before June 1991.</p><p class="depth0">D. Government Contract Employees</p><p class="depth0">1. Sponsoring activities are responsible for ensuring that the requirements in this part are included in the statement of work for all child care programs to be contracted. The contracting officer is responsible for performing any action necessary to verify that services provided by the contractor conform to contract quality requirements. Component designees for requiring activities shall ensure that the statement of work, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0">a. States that the contractor must ensure its employees have proper criminal history background checks as outlined in this part.</p><p class="depth0">b. States that actual checks are performed by the Government.</p><p class="depth0">c. Includes procedures that the contractor must follow to obtain checks for its employees; for example, identify the office where employees report for processing, identify proper forms to be completed, etc. Also, identify the DoD Component for billing purposes, and identify the appropriate security point of contact or installation commander as the authorized recipient of background check results.</p><p class="depth0">d. States that employees may be permitted to work before completion of background checks, provided the employee is within sight of an individual who has successfully completed a background check.</p><p class="depth0">e. States that employees have the right to obtain a copy of the background check report, whom they should contact for the copy and whom to contact for procedures to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information in the report.</p><p class="depth0">f. Requires that contractor employees who have previously received a background check must provide proof of the check or obtain a new one.</p><p class="depth0">2. Requirements for child care services must be submitted to the contracting officer sufficiently in advance of the required performance start date to provide time for obtaining background checks. Sponsoring activities' designees shall coordinate with the contracting officer as soon as possible after a requirement for child care services becomes known.</p><p class="depth0">3. Procedures for obtaining responses for background checks are the same as those for NAFI employees and response to derogatory information will occur through the appropriate designee and contractor. An IRC will be performed if the individual is a military member or family member, or has worked or lived on a military installation within 5 years.</p><p class="depth0">E. Other Providers</p><p class="depth0">Criminal history background checks with the FBI and the States are not required. Duplication of previous background checks are not required for personnel where official records demonstrate that an adequate check has already been conducted. This category includes the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. Military Members. These are active duty individuals (other than healthcare personnel) who seek to provide child care services as part of a normal duty assignment or are involved during off-duty hours. For these members an IRC and a current security clearance meet the requirements of this part. In the absence of a current security clearance, a name check of the DCII must be conducted. When military members are employed in an APF or a NAFI position they will abide by background check requirements listed in paragraphs B.1. and B.2. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2. Foster and Respite Care Providers and Family Members. These are individuals who seek to provide foster care or respite child care within Government-owned or -leased quarters. The care provider, all other adults, and each child, age 12 and older, residing within the applicant's household must receive an IRC. In addition, the Component designee must also obtain a name check of the DCII on all adults.</p><p class="depth0">FCC Providers and Family Members. These are individuals who seek licensing to provide child care within government-owned or -leased quarters. The care provider, all other adults, and each child, age 12 and older, residing within the applicant's household receive an IRC. In addition, the Component designee must obtain a name check of the DCII on all adults.</p><p class="depth0">4. Specified Volunteers. Installation commanders shall designate those positions that are determined to be ``specified.'' Individuals working in specified volunteer positions will have an IRC check because of the nature of

their work in child care services. The opportunity for contact may be extensive, frequent, or over a period of time. They include, but are not limited to, positions involving extensive interaction alone, extended travel, and/or overnight activities with children. An IRC is required for volunteers who are active-duty, a family member, or a DoD civilian overseas. A volunteer is allowed to work upon completion of a favorable IRC. Background checks are not required for volunteers whose services will be of shorter duration than is required to perform the background checks and who are under line of sight supervision by an individual who has successfully completed a background check. The Components are required to provide additional implementing guidance.</p><p class="depth0">F. Employment Application Requirement</p><p class="depth0">Public Law 101-647, section 231 requires that each application for employment shall include a question asking whether the individual has ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child, and, if so, requires a description of the disposition of the arrest or charge. The forms identified in paragraphs B.1.a. and B.2.a. of this appendix are signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury, with the applicable Federal punishment for perjury stated on the respective forms.</p><p class="depth0">1. An applicant's signature indicates an understanding of the employer's obligation to require a record check as a condition of employment. Information on background checks shall be maintained in accordance with applicable Component implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment for the conduct of any criminal history background check is the responsibility of the requesting Service or agency.</p><p class="depth0">3. The results of the background check are forwarded to the Component designee at the sending installation for appropriate action. A derogatory report would include, but not be limited to, the following applicable crimes: Any charge or conviction for a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, a substance abuse felony, or a violent crime.</p><p class="depth0">4. The hiring authority or designee is responsible for notifying the individual of a derogatory report. The individual may obtain a copy of the criminal history report and has the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report through the Privacy Program described in 32 CFR part 310. The individual may provide information concerning positive mitigating factors for any adverse information presented.</p><p class="depth0">5. Employees whose criminal history background checks result in nonselection for employment or service shall be informed by the Component designee of the right to an administrative appeal under 32 CFR part 310. The individual may appeal with a specific request such as amendments to the records or request to file statement disagreeing with information in the record. If the employee's request for record information is refused, the individual is informed of his or her right to an administrative appeal. As appropriate, Component designees shall inform individuals of other avenues available to resolve matters of concern such as an administrative or negotiated grievance procedures. If the employee remains dissatisfied, he or she may seek a review. The Department of Defense recognizes the privacy interests and rights of all applicants and employees, and its own responsibility in ensuring a safe and secure environment for children within DoD activities or private organizations on DoD installations.</p><p class="depth0">G. Record Re-Verification</p><p class="depth0">This procedure consists of an IRC and a DCII name check and is required by the Component designee at a minimum every 5 years for all employees providing child care services and covers the time period since the completion of the last background check. NAFI employees who change duty stations will complete a new investigation when considered for employment. A new investigation is required by the Department of Defense if a break in service results in a time-lapse of more than 2 years. FCC, foster care and respite care providers, and their family members will complete an IRC annually.</p><p class="depth0">H. Supervision</p><p class="depth0">Refers to temporary responsibility for children in child care services, and relates to oversight for temporary or permanent authority to exercise direction and control by an individual over an individual whose required background checks have been initiated but not completed. Use of video equipment is acceptable provided it is monitored by an individual who has successfully completed a background check. Supervision procedures pending completion of background checks for healthcare personnel suggest that the Surgeons General shall require close clinical supervision and full compliance with existing DoD Directives, Instructions, and other guidance (issued by the Department of Defense and the Military Department concerned) on quality assurance, risk management, licensure, employee orientation, and credentials certification. These policies rely on process and judgment, and meet the intent of the ``direct sight supervision'' provision, affording local commanders a flexible and reasonable alternative.I. Programs. Requirements cover all DoD-operated activities and private</p><p class="depth0">organizations on DoD installations and include, but are not</p><p class="depth0">limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Child Development Programs.</p><p class="depth0">a. Child development centers, part-day preschools, and enrichment programs.</p><p class="depth0">b. Family child care.</p><p class="depth0">c. Contracted Services, whether personal or non-personal services.</p><p class="depth0">2. Youth Programs.</p><p class="depth0">3. Dependents Schools operated by the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">4. Medical treatment facilities.</p><p class="depth0">5. Other contracted services.</p><p class="depth0">6. Private organizations on DoD installations.</p><p class="depth0">7. Volunteer activities.</p><p class="depth0">J. Background Check Matrix</p><p class="depth0">This identifies the requirements of this part for background checks by category of personnel. These checks are initiated through the personnel offices in collaboration with law enforcement and security personnel. (Reminder: An IRC may only be completed on an individual who is a military member or family member, or who lives or works on a military installation.)</p><p class="depth0">1. Appropriated Fund (APF) Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC. (SF-171, SF-87, and SF-85P).</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC. (DD Form 398-2 and FD Form 258).</p><p class="depth0">3. Foreign National Employees Overseas. IRC and local government check.</p><p class="depth0">4. Temporary Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC.</p><p class="depth0">5. Current Employees. FBI and SCHR.</p><p class="depth0">6. Government Contract Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC.</p><p class="depth0">7. Other Providers.</p><p class="depth0">a. Military Members. Military members will have an IRC and, if no current security clearance exists, a name check of the DCII. Checks are not required for military healthcare personnel.</p><p class="depth0">b. Foster and Respite Care Providers and Family Members (age 12 and older). IRC and Service DCII (for adults).</p><p class="depth0">c. Family Child Care Providers and Family Members (age 12 and older). IRC and Service DCII (for adults).</p><p class="depth0">d. Specified Volunteers. IRC.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 86--Criteria For Criminal History Background</p><p class="depth0">Check Disqualification</p><p class="depth0">The ultimate decision to determine how to use information obtained from the criminal history background checks in selection for positions involving the care, treatment, supervision, or education of children must incorporate a common sense decision based upon all known facts. Adverse information is evaluated by the DoD Component Head or designee who is qualified at the appropriate level of command in interpreting criminal history background checks. All information of record both favorable and unfavorable will be assessed in terms of its relevance, recentness, and seriousness. Likewise, positive mitigating factors should be considered. Final suitability decisions shall be made by that commander or designee. Criteria that will result in disqualification of an applicant require careful screening of the data and include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Mandatory Disqualifying Criteria</p><p class="depth0">Any conviction for a sexual offense, a drug felony, a violent crime, or a criminal offense involving a child or children.</p><p class="depth0">B. Discretionary Criteria</p><p class="depth0">1. Acts that may tend to indicate poor judgment, unreliability, or untrustworthiness in working with children.</p><p class="depth0">2. Any behavior; illness; or mental, physical, or emotional condition that in the opinion of a competent medical authority may cause a defect in judgment or reliability.</p><p class="depth0">3. Offenses involving assault, battery, or other abuse of a victim, regardless of age of the victim.</p><p class="depth0">4. Evidence or documentation of substance abuse dependency.</p><p class="depth0">5. Illegal or improper use, possession, or addiction to any controlled or psychoactive substances, narcotic, cannibas, or other dangerous drug.</p><p class="depth0">6. Sexual acts, conduct, or behavior that, because of the circumstances in which they occur, may indicate untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of judgment, or irresponsibility in working with children.</p><p class="depth0">7. A wide range of offenses such as arson, homicide, robbery, fraud, or any offense involving possession or use of a firearm.</p><p class="depth0">8. Evidence that the individual is a fugitive from justice.</p><p class="depth0">9. Evidence that the individual is an illegal alien who is not entitled to accept gainful employment for a position.</p><p class="depth0">10. A finding of negligence in a mishap causing death or serious injury to a child or dependent person entrusted to their care.</p><p class="depth0">C. Suitability Considerations</p><p class="depth0">In making a determination of suitability, the evaluator shall consider the following additional factors to the extent that these examples are considered pertinent to the individual case:</p><p class="depth0">1. The kind of position for which the individual is applying or employed.</p><p class="depth0">2. The nature and seriousness of the conduct.</p><p class="depth0">3. The recentness of the conduct.</p><p class="depth0">4. The age of the individual at the time of the conduct.</p><p class="depth0">5. The circumstances surrounding the conduct.</p><p class="depth0">6. Contributing social or environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth0">7. The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0">8. The nexus of the arrests in regard to the job to be performed.</p><p class="depth0">D. Questions</p><p class="depth0">1. All applications, for each of the categories of individuals identified in Sec. 86.3, will include the following questions: ``Have you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? Have you ever been asked to resign because of or been decertified for a sexual offense? And, if so, ``provide a description of the case disposition.'' For FCC, foster care, and respite care providers, this question is asked of the applicant regarding all adults, and all children 12 years and older, who reside in the household.</p><p class="depth0">2. All applications shall state that the form is being signed under penalty of perjury. In addition, a false statement rendered by an employee may result in adverse action up to and including removal from Federal service.</p><p class="depth0">3. Evaluation of criminal history background checks is made and monitored by qualified personnel at the appropriate level designated by the Component. Final suitability decisions are made by the designee.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 86--State Information</p><p class="depth0">All SCHR checks should be accompanied by the following: 1. State form, if required. If no State form is required, the request should be on letterhead, beginning with the statement that the check is in accordance with Public Law 101-647. The request must include full identifying information, such as: Name, date of birth, social security number, complete addresses, etc.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fingerprint set if required. Some State laws require a fingerprint set either on a State form or forms used by the agency.</p><p class="depth0">3. Release statement signed by the applicant or employee. If required by the State, the release must be notarized.</p><p class="depth0">4. Payment for the SCHR check.</p><p class="depth0">5. Self-addressed, stamped envelope.</p><p class="depth0">The following is an updated listing of State addresses, fees, and other information:
