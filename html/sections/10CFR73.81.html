An acceptable safeguards contingency plan must contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A predetermined set of decisions and actions to satisfy stated objectives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An identification of the data, criteria, procedures, and mechanisms necessary to efficiently implement the decisions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A stipulation of the individual, group, or organizational entity responsible for each decision and action.</p><p class="depth0">The goals of licensee safeguards contingency plans for responding to threats, thefts, and radiological sabotage are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To organize the response effort at the licensee level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To provide predetermined, structured responses by licensees to safeguards contingencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To ensure the integration of the licensee response with the responses by other entities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To achieve a measurable performance in response capability.</p><p class="depth0">Licensee safeguards contingency planning should result in organizing the licensee's resources in such a way that the participants will be identified, their several responsibilities specified, and the responses coordinated. The responses should be timely.</p><p class="depth0">It is important to note that a licensee's safeguards contingency plan is intended to be complementary to any emergency plans developed under appendix E to part 50 of this chapter, Sec. 52.17 or Sec. 52.79, or to Sec. 70.22(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">contents of the plan</p><p class="depth0">Each licensee safeguards contingency plan shall include five categories of information:1. Background2. Generic Planning Base3. Licensee Planning Base4. Responsibility Matrix5. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Although the implementing procedures (the fifth category of Plan information) are the culmination of the planning process, and therefore are an integral and important part of the safeguards contingency plan, they entail operating details subject to frequent changes. They need not be submitted to the Commission for approval, but will be inspected by NRC staff on a periodic basis. The licensee is responsible for ensuring that the implementing procedures reflect the information in the Responsibility Matrix, appropriately summarized and suitably presented for effective use by the responding entities.</p><p class="depth0">The following paragraphs describe the contents of the safeguards contingency plan.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Responsibility Matrix. This category of information consists of detailed identification of the organizational entities responsible for each decision and action associated with specific responses to safeguards contingencies. For each initiating event, a tabulation shall be made for each response entity depicting the assignment of responsibilities for all decisions and actions to be taken in response to the initiating event. (Not all entities will have assigned responsibilities for any given initiating event.) The tabulations in the Responsibility Matrix shall provide an overall picture of the response actions and their interrelationships. Safeguards responsibilities shall be assigned in a manner that precludes conflict in duties or responsibilities that would prevent the execution of the plan in any safeguards contingency.</p><p class="depth0">5.
