Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section where a claim is filed by an additional   dependent who has apparent entitlement which, if established, would  require reduction of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity  compensation being paid to another dependent, payments to the person or  persons on the rolls will be reduced as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where benefits would be payable from a date prior to the date of  filing claim, the reduction will be effective from the date of potential  entitlement of the additional dependent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where benefits would be payable from the date of filing claim,  the reduction will be effective the date of receipt of the claim by the  additional dependent, or date of last payment, whichever is later.  If entitlement of the additional dependent is not established, benefits  previously being paid will be resumed, if otherwise in order, commencing  the day following the effective date of reduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New awards. If the additional dependent is found to be entitled,  the full rate payable will be authorized effective the date of  entitlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retroactive DIC award to a school child--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If DIC  (dependency and indemnity compensation) is being currently paid to a  veteran's child or children under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a), and DIC is  retroactively awarded to an additional child of the veteran based on  school attendance, the full rate payable to the additional child shall  be awarded the first of the month following the month in which the award  to the additional child is approved. The rate payable under the current  award shall be reduced effective the date the full rate is awarded to  the additional child. The rate payable to the additional child for  periods prior to the date the full rate is awarded shall be the  difference between the rate payable for all the children and the rate  that was payable before the additional child established entitlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this  section are applicable only when the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The additional child was receiving DIC under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a)  prior to attaining age 18; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> DIC for the additional child was discontinued on or after  attainment of age 18; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After DIC has been discontinued, the additional child  reestablishes entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a) based on  attendance at an approved school and the effective date of entitlement  is prior to the date the Department of Veterans Affairs receives the  additional child's claim to reestablish entitlement.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1313(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. This paragraph is applicable to DIC paid after  September 30, 1981. If DIC is retroactively awarded for a period prior  to October 1, 1981, payment for the period prior to October 1, 1981  shall be made under paragraph (a) of this section and payment for the  period after September 30, 1981, shall be made under this paragraph.
