                                Sec. 1956.109  General requirements for debt settlement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debt due and payable. The debt or any extension thereof on which  settlement is requested must be due and payable under the terms of the  note or other instrument, or because of acceleration by written notice  prior to the date of application for settlement, unless the debt is to  be cancelled without application under Sec. 1956.130(b) or charged off  under Sec. 1956.136 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of security. Ordinarily, all security will be  disposed of prior to the date of application for settlement. There are  exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It may be necessary to abandon security through the debt  settlement process. For example, a community may be rendered  uninhabitable by a toxic or hazardous substance. In such cases, debt  settlement may proceed provided the servicing official determines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That further collection efforts with respect to the security in  question would be ineffective or uneconomical,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That it is in the best interests of the Government to proceed  with debt settlement,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the proposal otherwise meets the requirements appropriate  to the type of settlement under consideration, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The approval of the Administrator is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A servicing action may have been carried out which resulted in a  less than complete disposition of security. For example, the Government  may have consented to a voluntary sale of a debtor's real and chattel  property without reference to other security, which might include, but  is not limited to: an additional lien on revenue, a third party pledge  of security, or a pledge of personal liability. In such cases, debt  settlement may proceed provided the requirements of Sec. 1956.109(b)(1)  of this subpart are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Security can be retained under the compromise and adjustment  offers as specified in Sec. 1956.124 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Settlement of a claim against an estate will be based on the  recovery that may reasonably be expected, taking into consideration such  items as the security, costs of administration, allowances of minor  children and surviving spouse, allowable funeral expenses, dower and  curtesy rights, and specific encumbrances on the property having  priority over claims of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proceeds from the sale of security. Proceeds from the sale of  security must be applied on the debtor's account, taking into  consideration the disposition requirements of any grant agreement, prior  to the date of application for settlement, except when security is  retained as provided for in Sec. 1956.109(b) of this subpart. Debtors  will not be allowed to sell security and use the proceeds as part or all  of the debt settlement offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this subpart. No settlement shall be approved if it is  more favorable to the debtor than recommended by the County Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assistance from Office of General Counsel (OGC). When necessary,  State Directors will obtain advice from OGC in handling proposed debt  settlement actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Format. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 1956-1, ``Application for Settlement of Indebtedness,'' will be  utilized for all settlement actions under this subpart.</p>
