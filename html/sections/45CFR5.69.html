Sec. 5b.3  Policy.</p><p class="depth0">It is the policy of the Department to protect the privacy of individuals to the fullest extent possible while nonetheless permitting the exchange of records required to fulfill the administrative and program responsibilities of

the Department, and responsibilities of the Department for disclosing records which the general public is entitled to have under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.


Sec. 5b.4  Maintenance of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No record will be maintained by the Department unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is relevant and necessary to accomplish a Department function required to be accomplished by statute or Executive Order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is acquired to the greatest extent practicable from the subject individual when maintenance of the record may result in a determination about the subject individual's rights, benefits or privileges under Federal programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The individual providing the record is informed of the authority for providing the record (including whether the providing of the record is mandatory or voluntary, the principal purpose for maintaining the record, the routine uses for the record, what effect his refusal to provide the record may have on him), and if the record is not required by statute or Executive Order to be provided by the individual, he agrees to provide the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No record will be maintained by the Department which describes how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized (1) by statute, or (2) by the subject individual, or (3) unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.


Sec. 5b.5  Notification of or access to records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Times, places, and manner of requesting notification of or access to a record. (1) Subject to the provisions governing medical records in Sec. 5b.6 of this part, any individual may request notification of a record. He may at the same time request access to any record pertaining to him. An individual may be accompanied by another individual of his choice when he requests access to a record in person; Provided, That he affirmatively authorizes the presence of such other individual during any discussion of a record to which access is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An individual making a request for notification of or access to a record shall address his request to the responsible Department official and shall verify his identity when required in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the time the request is made, the individual shall specify which systems of records he wishes to have searched and the records to which he wishes to have access. He may also request that copies be made of all or any such records. An individual shall also provide the responsible Department official with sufficient particulars to enable such official to distinguish between records on subject individuals with the same name. The necessary particulars are set forth in the notices of systems of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An individual who makes a request in person may leave with any responsible Department official a request for notification of or access to a record under the control of another responsible Department official; Provided, That the request is addressed in writing to the appropriate responsible Department official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Verification of identity--(1) When required. Unless an individual, who is making a request for notification of or access to a record in person, is personally known to the responsible Department official, he shall be required to verify his identity in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> He makes a request for notification of a record and the responsible Department official determines that the mere disclosure of the existence of the record would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy if disclosed to someone other than the subject individual; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> He makes a request for access to a record which is not required to be disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner of verifying identity. (i) An individual who makes a request in person shall provide to the responsible Department official at least one piece of tangible identification such as a driver's license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to verify his identity. If an individual does not have identification papers to

verify his identity, he shall certify in writing that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an individual who does not make a request in person shall submit a notarized request to the responsible Department official to verify his identity or shall certify in his request that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An individual who makes a request on behalf of a minor or legal incompetent as authorized under Sec. 5b.10 of this part shall verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent, in addition to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of the minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other competent evidence of guardianship to the responsible Department official; except that, an individual is not required to verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent when he is not required to verify his own identity or when evidence of his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent has been previously given to the responsible Department official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An individual shall further verify his identity if he is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as medical records. Any further verification shall parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. Such further verification may include such particulars as the individual's years of attendance at a particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed services, date or place of birth, names of parents, an occupation or the specific times the individual received medical treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An individual who makes a request by telephone shall verify his identity by providing to the responsible Department official identifying particulars which parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. If the responsible Department official determines that the particulars provided by telephone are insufficient, the requester will be required to submit the request in writing or in person. Telephone requests will not be accepted where an individual is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as medical records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Granting notification of or access to a record. (1) Subject to the provisions governing medical records in Sec. 5b.6 of this part and the provisions governing exempt systems in Sec. 5b.11 of this part, a responsible Department official, who receives a request for notification of or access to a record and, if required, verification of an individual's identity, will review the request and grant notification or access to a record, if the individual requesting access to the record is the subject individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the responsible Department official determines that there will be a delay in responding to a request because of the number of requests being processed, a breakdown of equipment, shortage of personnel, storage of records in other locations, etc., he will so inform the individual and indicate when notification or access will be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior to granting notification of or access to a record, the responsible Department official may at his discretion require an individual making a request in person to reduce his request to writing if the individual has not already done so at the time the request is made.


Sec. 5b.6  Special procedures for notification of or access to medical records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. An individual in general has a right to notification of or access to his medical records, including psychological records, as well as to other records pertaining to him maintained by the Department. This section sets forth special procedures as permitted by the Act for notification of or access to medical records, including a special procedure for notification of or access to medical records of minors. The special procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may not be suitable for use by every component of the Department. Therefore, components may

follow the paragraph (b) procedure for notification of or access to medical records, or may issue regulations establishing special procedures for such purposes. The special procedure set forth in paragraph (c) of this section relating to medical records of minors is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Medical records procedures--(1) Notification of or access to medical records. (i) Any individual may request notification of or access to a medical record pertaining to him. Unless the individual is a parent or guardian requesting notification of or access to a minor's medical record, an individual shall make a request for a medical record in accordance with this section and the procedures in Sec. 5b.5 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual who requests notification of or access to a medical record shall, at the time the request is made, designate a representative in writing. The representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible individual, who would be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Utilization of the designated representative. A subject individual will be granted direct access to a medical record if the responsible official determines that direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual. If the responsible Department official believes that he is not qualified to determine, or if he does determine, that direct access to the subject individual is likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual, the record will be sent to the designated representative. The subject individual will be informed in writing that the record has been sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Medical records of minors--(1) Requests by minors; notification of or access to medical records to minors. A minor may request notification of or access to a medical record pertaining to him in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests on a minor's behalf; notification of or access to medical records to an individual on a minor's behalf. (i) In order to protect the privacy of a minor, a parent or guardian, authorized to act on a minor's behalf as provided in Sec. 5b.10 of this part, who makes a request for notification of or access to a minor's medical record will not be given direct notification of or access to such record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A parent or guardian shall make all requests for notification of or access to a minor's medical record in accordance with this paragraph and the procedures in Sec. 5b.5 of this part. A parent or guardian shall at the time he makes a request designate a family physician or other health professional (other than a family member) to whom the record, if any, will be sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where a medical record on the minor exists, it will be sent to the physician or health professional designated by the parent or guardian in all cases. If disclosure of the record would constitute an invasion of the minor's privacy, that fact will be brought to the attention of the physician or health professional to whom the record is sent. The physician or health professional will be asked to consider the effect that disclosure of the record to the parent or guardian would have on the minor in determining whether the minor's medical record should be made available to the parent or guardian. Response to the parent or guardian making the request will be made in substantially the following form:
We have completed processing your request for notification of or access to______________________________________________________________________
____________________'s</p><p class="depth0">(Name of minor)
medical records. Please be informed that if any medical record were found pertaining to that individual, they have not been sent to your designated physician or health professional.

In each case where a minor's medical record is sent to a physician or health professional, reasonable efforts will be made to so inform the minor.


Sec. 5b.7  Procedures for correction or amendment of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any subject individual may request that his record be corrected or amended if he believes that the record is not accurate, timely, complete, or relevant or necessary to accomplish a Department function. A subject individual making a request to amend or correct his record shall address his request to the responsible Department

official in writing; except that, the request need not be in writing if the subject individual makes his request in person and the responsible Department official corrects or amends the record at that time. The subject individual shall specify in each request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system of records from which the record is retrieved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The particular record which he is seeking to correct or amend;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether he is seeking an addition to or a deletion or substitution of the record; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> His reasons for requesting correction or amendment of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A request for correction or amendment of a record will be acknowledged within 10 working days of its receipt unless the request can be processed and the subject individual informed of the responsible Department official's decision on the request within that 10 day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the responsible Department official agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete based on a preponderance of the evidence, the record will be corrected or amended. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Department function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, the subject individual will be informed in writing of the correction, amendment, or deletion and, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the responsible Department official does not agree that the record should be corrected or amended, the subject individual will be informed in writing of the refusal to correct or amend the record. He will also be informed that he may appeal the refusal to correct or amend his record to the appropriate appeal authority listed in Sec. 5b.8 of this part. The appropriate appeal authority will be identified to the subject individual by name, title, and business address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requests to correct or amend a record governed by the regulation of another government agency, e.g., Civil Service Commission, Federal Bureau of Investigation, will be forwarded to such government agency for processing and the subject individual will be informed in writing of the referral.


Sec. 5b.8  Appeals of refusals to correct or amend records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Processing the appeal. (1) A subject individual who disagrees with a refusal to correct or amend his record may appeal the refusal in writing. All appeals shall be made to the following appeal authorities, or their designees, or successors in function:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management for records of the Office of the Secretary, or where the initial refusal to correct or amend was made by another appeal authority. The appeal authority for an initial refusal by the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management is the Under Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assistant Secretary for Health for records of the Public Health Service including Office of Assistant Secretary for Health; Health Resources Administration; Health Services Administration; Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration; Center for Disease Control; National Institutes of Health; and Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assistant Secretary for Education for records of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Education, National Center for Education Statistics, National Institute of Education, and Office of Education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assistant Secretary for Human Development for records of the Office of Human Development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Commissioner of Social Security for records of the Social Security Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Administrator, Social and Rehabilitation Service for the records of the Social and Rehabilitation Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An appeal will be completed within 30 working days from its receipt by the appeal authority; except that, the appeal authority may for good cause extend this period for an additional 30 days. Should the appeal period be extended, the subject individual appealing the refusal to correct or amend the record will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of

the delay. The subject individual's request to amend or correct the record, the responsible Department official's refusal to correct or amend, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal will be reviewed. No hearing will be held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the appeal authority agrees that the record subject to the appeal should be corrected or amended, the record will be amended and the subject individual will be informed in writing of the correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the appeal is denied, the subject individual will be informed in writing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Of the denial and the reasons for the denial;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That he has a right to seek judicial review of the denial; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That he may submit to the responsible Department official a concise statement of disagreement to be associated with the disputed record and disclosed whenever the record is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notation and disclosure of disputed records. Whenever a subject individual submits a statement of disagreement to the responsible Department official in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the record will be noted to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of the subject individual's statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the responsible Department official deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the appeal authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal may also be disclosed with the record. While the subject individual will have access to this statement of reasons, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of the subject individual's statement of disagreement, as well as the statement, if any, of the appeal authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal.


Sec. 5b.9  Disclosure of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Consent to disclosure by a subject individual. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section authorizing disclosures of records without consent, no disclosure of a record will be made without the consent of the subject individual. In each case the consent, whether obtained from the subject individual at the request of the Department or whether provided to the Department by the subject individual on his own initiative, shall be in writing. The consent shall specify the individual, organizational unit or class of individuals or organizational units to whom the record may be disclosed, which record may be disclosed and, where applicable, during which time frame the record may be disclosed (e.g., during the school year, while the subject individual is out of the country, whenever the subject individual is receiving specific services). A blanket consent to disclose all of a subject individual's records to unspecified individuals or organizational units will not be honored. The subject individual's identity and, where applicable (e.g., where a subject individual gives consent to disclosure of a record to a specific individual), the identity of the individual to whom the record is to be disclosed shall be verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A parent or guardian of any minor is not authorized to give consent to a disclosure of the minor's medical record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disclosures without the consent of the subject individual. The disclosures listed in this paragraph may be made without the consent of the subject individual. Such disclosures are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To those officers and employees of the Department who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties. The responsible Department official may upon request of any officer or employee, or on his own initiative, determine what constitutes legitimate need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a routine use as defined in paragraph (j) of Sec. 5b.1 of this part.
