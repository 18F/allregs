Property  acquisitions and relocation projects for open space proposed for funding  pursuant to a major disaster declared on or after December 3, 2007 must  be implemented in accordance with part 80 of this chapter. For major  disasters declared before December 3, 2007, a project involving property  acquisition or the relocation of structures and individuals is eligible  for assistance only if the applicant enters into an agreement with the  FEMA Regional Administrator that provides assurances that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following restrictive covenants shall be conveyed in the  deed to any property acquired, accepted, or from which structures are  removed (hereafter called in section (d) the property):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The property shall be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for  uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management  practices; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No new structure(s) will be built on the property except as  indicated below:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally  related to a designated open space or recreational use;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A rest room; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A structure that is compatible with open space, recreational, or  wetlands management usage and proper floodplain management policies and  practices, which the Administrator approves in writing before the  construction of the structure begins.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After completion of the project, no application for additional  disaster assistance will be made for any purpose with respect to the  property to any Federal entity or source, and no Federal entity or  source will provide such assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In general, allowable open space, recreational, and wetland  management uses include parks for outdoor recreational activities,  nature reserves, cultivation, grazing, camping (except where adequate  warning time is not available to allow evacuation), temporary storage in  the open of wheeled vehicles which are easily movable (except mobile  homes), unimproved, previous parking lots, and buffer zones.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any structures built on the property according to paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, shall be floodproofed or elevated to the Base  Flood Elevation plus one foot of freeboard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duplication of programs.
