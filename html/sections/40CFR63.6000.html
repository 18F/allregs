Use the methods and equations in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the overall control efficiency compliance alternatives described in Sec. 63.5989(a) and (b). Use the methods and equations in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the HAP constituent compliance alternative described in Sec. 63.5989(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 1. Follow the test procedures described in Sec. 63.5993 to determine the overall control efficiency of your system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must also meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct the performance test using a puncture sealant with an average mass percent HAP content that is representative of the puncture sealants typically used at your puncture sealant application affected source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establish all applicable operating limit ranges that correspond to the control system efficiency as described in Table 5 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the overall efficiency of the control system. If you have a permanent total enclosure that satisfies EPA Method 204 (found in 40 CFR part 51, appendix M) criteria, assume 100 percent capture efficiency for variable F. Equation 1 follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JY02.008

Also, if you use an enclosure, monitor to ensure that the sizes of the NDO have not changed, that there are no new NDO, and that a HAP emission source has not been moved closer to an NDO since the last performance test was conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If you use other capture systems, monitor the parameters identified in your monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Maintain the operating parameter within the operating range established during the performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods to determine the mass percent of each HAP in puncture sealants. To determine the HAP content in the puncture sealant used at your puncture sealant application affected source, use EPA Method 311 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63, an approved alternative method, or any other reasonable means for determining the HAP content of your puncture sealants. Other reasonable means include, but are not limited to: an MSDS, provided it contains appropriate information; a CPDS; or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet. You are not required to test the materials that you use, but the Administrator may require a test using EPA Method 311 (or an approved alternative method) to confirm the reported HAP content. If the results of an analysis by EPA Method 311 are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 results will govern compliance determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2.
