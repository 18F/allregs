                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claiming the credit--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The enhanced oil recovery  credit (the ``credit'') is a component of the section 38 general  business credit. A taxpayer that owns an operating mineral interest (as  defined in Sec.  1.614-2(b)) in a property may claim the credit for  qualified enhanced oil recovery costs (as described in Sec.  1.43-4)  paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with a qualified enhanced  oil recovery project (as described in Sec.  1.43-2) undertaken with  respect to the property. A taxpayer that does not own an operating  mineral interest in a property may not claim the credit. To the extent a  credit included in the current year business credit under section 38(b)  is unused under section 38, the credit is carried back or forward under  the section 39 business credit carryback and carryforward rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Credit for operating mineral interest owner. In 1992, A,  the owner of an operating mineral interest in a property, begins a  qualified enhanced oil recovery project using cyclic steam. B, who owns  no interest in the property, purchases and places in service a steam  generator. B sells A steam, which A uses as a tertiary injectant  described in section 193. Because A owns an operating mineral interest  in the property with respect to which the project is undertaken, A may  claim a credit for the cost of the steam. Although B owns the steam  generator used to produce steam for the project, B may not claim a  credit for B's costs because B does not own an operating mineral  interest in the property.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Credit for operating mineral interest owner. C and D are  partners in CD, a partnership that owns an operating mineral interest in  a property. In 1992, CD begins a qualified enhanced oil recovery project  using cyclic steam. D purchases a steam generator and sells steam to CD.  Because CD owns an operating mineral interest in the property with  respect to which the project is undertaken, CD may claim a credit for  the cost of the steam. Although D owns the steam generator used to  produce steam for the project, D may not claim a credit for the costs of  the steam generator because D paid these costs in a capacity other than  that of an operating mineral interest owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of the credit. A taxpayer's credit is an amount equal to  15 percent of the taxpayer's qualified enhanced oil recovery costs for  the taxable year, reduced by the phase-out amount, if any, determined  under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Phase-out of the credit as crude oil prices increase--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. The amount of the credit (determined without regard to this  paragraph (c)) for any taxable year is reduced by an amount which bears  the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to  this paragraph (c)) as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount by which the reference price determined under section  29(d)(2)(C) for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar  year in which the taxable year begins exceeds $28 (as adjusted under  paragraph (c)(2) of this section); bears to</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inflation adjustment--(i) In general. For any taxable year  beginning in a calendar year after 1991, an amount equal to $28  multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor is substituted for the $28  amount under paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inflation adjustment factor. For purposes of this paragraph  (c), the inflation adjustment factor for any calendar year is a  fraction, the numerator of which is the GNP implicit price deflator for  the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is the GNP  implicit price deflator for 1990. The ``GNP implicit price deflator'' is  the first revision of the implicit price deflator for the gross national  product as computed and published by the Secretary of Commerce. As early  as practicable, the inflation adjustment factor for each calendar year  will be published by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Reference price exceeds $28. In 1992, E, the owner of an  operating mineral interest in a property, incurs $100 of qualified  enhanced oil recovery costs. The reference price for 1991 determined  under section 29(d)(2)(C) is $30 and the inflation adjustment factor for  1992 is 1. E's credit for 1992 determined without regard to the phase- out for crude oil price increases is $15 ($100 x 15%). In determining  E's credit, the credit is reduced by $5 ($15 x ($30 - ($28 x 1))/6).  Accordingly, E's credit for 1992 is $10 ($15 - $5).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Inflation adjustment. In 1993, F, the owner of an  operating mineral interest in a property, incurs $100 of qualified  enhanced oil recovery costs. The 1992 reference price is $34, and the  1993 inflation adjustment factor is 1.10. F's credit for 1993 determined  without regard to the phase-out for crude oil price increases is $15  ($100 x 15%). In determining F's credit, $30.80 (1.10 x $28) is  substituted for $28, and the credit is reduced by $8 ($15 x ($34 -  $30.80)/6). Accordingly, F's credit for 1993 is $7 ($15 - $8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reduction of associated deductions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Any  deduction allowable under chapter 1 for an expenditure taken into  account in computing the amount of the credit determined under paragraph  (b) of this section is reduced by the amount of the credit attributable  to the expenditure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (extent to which integrated oil company  intangible drilling and development costs are qualified enhanced oil  recovery costs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e))</em> result  from an expenditure with respect to the property is reduced by the  amount of the credit determined under paragraph (b) of this section  attributable to the expenditure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Passthrough entity basis adjustment--(1) Partners' interests in  a partnership. To the extent a partnership expenditure is not deductible  under paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section or does not increase the basis of  property under paragraph (e) of this section, the expenditure is treated  as an expenditure described in section 705(a)(2)(B) (concerning  decreases to basis of partnership interests). Thus, the adjusted bases  of the partners' interests in the partnership are decreased (but not  below zero).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(D)</em> (concerning decreases to basis of S corporation  stock). Thus, the bases of the shareholders' S corporation stock are  decreased (but not below zero).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Deductions reduced for credit amount. In 1992, G, the  owner of an operating mineral interest in a property, incurs $100 of  intangible drilling and development costs in connection with a qualified  enhanced oil recovery project undertaken with respect to the property. G  elects under section 263(c) to deduct these intangible drilling and  development costs. The amount of the credit determined under paragraph  (b) of this section attributable to the $100 of intangible drilling and  development costs is $15 ($100 x 15%). Therefore, G's otherwise  allowable deduction of $100 for the intangible drilling and development  costs is reduced by $15. Accordingly, in 1992, G may deduct under  section 263(c) only $85 ($100 - $15) for these costs.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Integrated oil company deduction reduced. The facts are  the same as in Example 1, except that G is an integrated oil company. As  in Example 1, the amount of the credit determined under paragraph (b) of  this section attributable to the $100 of intangible drilling and  development costs is $15, and G's allowable deduction under section  263(c) is $85. Because G is an integrated oil company, G must capitalize  25.50 ($85 x 30%) under section 291(b). Therefore, in 1992, G may deduct  under section 263(c) only $59.50 ($85 - $25.50) for these intangible  drilling and development costs.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Basis of property reduced. In 1992, H, the owner of an  operating mineral interest in a property, pays $100 to purchase tangible  property that is an integral part of a qualified enhanced oil recovery  project undertaken with respect to the property. The amount of the  credit determined under paragraph (b) of this section attributable to  the $100 is $15 ($100 x 15%). Therefore, for purposes of subtitle A, H's  basis in the tangible property is $85 ($100 - $15).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Basis of interest in passthrough entity reduced. In 1992,  I is a $50% partner in IJ, a partnership that owns an operating mineral  interest in a property. IJ pays $200 to purchase tangible property that  is an integral part of a qualified enhanced oil recovery project  undertaken with respect to the property. The amount of the credit  determined under paragraph (b) of this section attributable to the $200  is $30 ($200 x 15%). Therefore, for purposes of subtitle A, IJ's basis  in the tangible property is $170 ($200 - $30). Under paragraph (f) of  this section, the amount of the purchase price that does not increase  the basis of the property ($30) is treated as an expenditure described  in section 705(a)(2)(B). Therefore, I's basis in the partnership  interest is reduced by $15 (I's allocable share of the section  705(a)(2)(B) expenditure ($30 x 50%)).
