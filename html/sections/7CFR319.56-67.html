                                Sec. 319.56-67  Cape gooseberry from Colombia.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana) may be imported into the United   States from Colombia in accordance with the conditions described in this  section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of  Ceratitis capitata.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Workplan. The national plant protection organization (NPPO) of  Colombia must provide a bilateral workplan to APHIS that details the  activities that the NPPO will, subject to APHIS' approval, carry out to  meet the requirements of this section. APHIS will be directly involved  with the NPPO in the monitoring and auditing implementation of the  systems approach.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Places of production. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All places of production must be  registered with the NPPO of Colombia.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All places of production must be located within the C. capitata  low prevalence area of the Bogota Savannah and the neighboring  municipalities above 2,200 meters in the Departments of Boyac[aacute]  and Cundinamarca.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mitigation measures for C. capitata. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trapping for C.  capitata must be conducted in the places of production in accordance  with the bilateral workplan to demonstrate that those places are free of  C. capitata. Specific trapping requirements must be included in the  bilateral workplan. The NPPO of Colombia must keep records of fruit fly  detections for each trap and make the records available to APHIS upon  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All fruit flies trapped must be reported to APHIS immediately.  Capture of C. capitata will result in immediate cancellation of exports  from farms within a 5 kilometer radius (78.54 square kilometers) of the  detection site. An additional 50 traps must be placed within an area  with a 1.26 kilometer radius (5 square kilometers) surrounding the  detection site. If a second detection is made within 30 days of a  previous capture, eradication using a bait spray agreed upon by APHIS  and the NPPO of Colombia must be initiated in the detection area.  Treatment must continue for at least 2 months. Exports may resume from  the detection area when APHIS and the NPPO of Colombia agree the risk  has been mitigated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Post-harvest procedures. The cape gooseberry must be packed in  boxes marked with the identity of the originating farm. The boxes must  be packed in sealed and closed containers before being shipped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Phytosanitary inspection. After packing, the NPPO of Colombia  must visually inspect a biometric sample of cape gooseberry at a rate  jointly approved by APHIS and the NPPO of Colombia, and cut open the  sampled fruit to detect C. capitata.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Commercial consignments. The cape gooseberry must be imported in  commercial consignments only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. Each consignment of cape gooseberry  must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of  Colombia containing an additional declaration stating that the fruit  originated from a place of production free of C. capitata within the low  prevalence area of Bogota Savannah and the neighboring municipalities  above 2,200 meters of elevation in the Departments of Boyac[aacute] and  Cundinamarca and was produced in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 319.56-67.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0579-0411)  [79 FR 24997, May 2, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 59090, Oct. 1, 2014]</p>
