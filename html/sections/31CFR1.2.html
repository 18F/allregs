                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552) provides for access to information and records developed or maintained by Federal agencies. The provisions of section 552 are intended to assure the right of the public to information. Generally, this section divides agency information into three major categories and provides methods by which each category of information is to be made available to the public. The three major categories of information are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required to be published in the Federal Register (see Sec. 1.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information required to be made available for public inspection and copying or, in the alternative, to be published and offered for sale (see Sec. 1.4); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information required to be made available to any member of the public upon specific request (see Sec. 1.5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject only to the exemptions and exclusions set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c), any person shall be afforded access to information or records in the possession of any bureau of the Department of the Treasury, subject to the regulations in this subpart and any regulations of a bureau implementing or supplementing them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemptions. (1) The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) do not apply to certain matters which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain matters which are excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) do not apply to certain matters which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain matters which are excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Even though an exemption described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) may be applicable to the information or records requested, a Treasury bureau may, if not precluded by law, elect under the circumstances of that request not to apply the exemption. The fact that the exemption is not applied by a bureau in response to a particular request shall have no precedential significance in processing other requests, but is merely an indication that, in the processing of the particular request, the bureau finds no necessity for applying the exemption.</p>
