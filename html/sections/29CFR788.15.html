                            <p class="depth0">In many cases an employer who operates a sawmill or concentration  yard will be supplied with logs or other forestry products by several  crews of persons who are engaged in the named operations. Frequently  some or all of such crews, separately considered, do not employ more  than eight persons but the total number of such employees is in excess  of eight. Whether the exemption will apply to the members of the  individual crews which do not exceed eight will depend on whether they  are employees of the sawmill or concentration yard to which the logs or  other forestry products are delivered or whether each such crew is a  truly independently owned and operated business. If the number of  employees in such a truly independently owned and operated business does  not exceed eight, the exemption will apply. On the other hand, the  Secretary and the Administrator will assume that the courts will be  reluctant to approve as bona fide a plan by which an employer of a large  number of woods employees splits his employees into several allegedly  ``independent businesses'' in order to take advantage of the exemption.</p>
