For purposes of paragraph (b) of this  section, the amount of a taxable gift as finally determined for gift tax  purposes is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the taxable gift as shown on a gift tax return, or  on a statement attached to the return, if the Internal Revenue Service  does not contest such amount before the time has expired under section  6501 within which gift taxes may be assessed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount as specified by the Internal Revenue Service before  the time has expired under section 6501 within which gift taxes may be  assessed on the gift, if such specified amount is not timely contested  by the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount as finally determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The amount as determined pursuant to a settlement agreement  entered into between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the  amount is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction when  the court enters a final decision, judgment, decree or other order with  respect to the amount of the taxable gift that is not subject to appeal.  See, for example, section 7481 regarding the finality of a decision by  the U.S. Tax Court. Also, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section,  a settlement agreement means any agreement entered into by the Internal  Revenue Service and the taxpayer that is binding on both.

Notwithstanding Sec. 20.2001-1(b), see Sec. Sec.  20.2010-2T(d) and 20.2010-3T(d) for additional rules regarding the  authority of the Internal Revenue Service to examine any gift or other  tax return(s), even if the time within which a tax may be assessed under  section 6501 has expired, for the purpose of determining the deceased  spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount available under section 2010(c)  of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective/applicability date.
