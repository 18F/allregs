                                Sec. 1234.32  What does an agency have to do to certify a fire-safety
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Content of documentation. The agency must submit documentation to the Director, Space and Security Management Division (NAS), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, phone number (301) 837-1867, that describes the space being protected (e.g., the type and stacking height of the storage equipment used, or how the space is designed, controlled, and operated) and the characteristics of the fire-safety detection and suppression system used. The documentation must demonstrate how that system meets the requirement in Sec. 1234.12(s) through:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement that the facility is using a NARA certified system as described in Appendix B to this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A report of the results of independent live fire testing (Factory Mutual, Underwriters Laboratories or Southwest Research Institute); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A report under seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Describes the design intent of the fire suppression system to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 fluid ounces of petroleum-type hydrocarbon accelerant (such as, for example, heptanes or gasoline) to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of Federal records destroyed by fire. The report need not predict a maximum single event loss at any specific number, but rather should describe the design intent of the fire suppression system. The report may make reasonable engineering and other assumptions such as that the fire department responds within XX minutes (the local fire department's average response time) and promptly commences suppression actions. In addition, any report prepared under this paragraph should assume that the accelerant is saturated in a cotton wick that is 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches long and sealed in a plastic bag and that the fire is started in an aisle at the face of a carton at floor level. Assumptions must be noted in the report;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Details the characteristics of the system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Describes the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by the applicable building code that have been incorporated to limit destruction of records. The report should

make specific references to industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> NARA action. (1) NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 10 work days if NARA has previously approved the system design for similarly configured space or if a report of independent testing of a new system design is furnished as documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If, in NARA's judgment, the supporting documentation provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section clearly demonstrates compliance with Sec. 1234.12(s), NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 30 calendar days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If NARA questions whether supporting documentation demonstrates compliance with Sec. 1234.12(s), NARA will consult the appropriate industry standards body or other qualified expert before making a determination. Before any consultation, NARA may ask the agency for additional clarifying information. NARA will notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request that consultation is necessary and will provide a final determination within 60 calendar days. If NARA does not approve the system, NARA will furnish a full explanation of the reasons for its decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> NARA will maintain a list of approved alternative systems.</p>
