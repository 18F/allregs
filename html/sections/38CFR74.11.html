                                Sec. 74.11  How does CVE process applications for VetBiz VIP Verification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director, Center for Veterans Enterprise, is authorized to approve or deny applications for VetBiz VIP Verification. The CVE will receive, review and evaluate all VetBiz VIP Verification applications. CVE will advise each applicant within 30 days, when practicable, after the receipt of an application whether the application is complete and suitable for evaluation and, if not, what additional information or clarification is required to complete the application. CVE will process an application for VetBiz VIP Verification status within 60 days, when practicable, of receipt of a complete application package. Incomplete application packages will not be processed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CVE, in its sole discretion, may request clarification of information contained in the application at any time in the eligibility determination process. CVE will take into account any clarifications made by an applicant in response to a request for such by CVE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant's eligibility will be based on circumstances existing on the date of application, except where clarification is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Changed circumstances for an applicant occurring subsequent to its application and which adversely affect eligibility will be considered and may constitute grounds for denial of the application. The applicant must inform CVE of any changed circumstances that could adversely affect its eligibility for the program (i.e., ownership or control changes) during its application review. Failure to inform CVE of any such changed circumstances constitutes good cause for which CVE may withdraw verified status for the participant if non-compliance is discovered after a participant has been verified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The decision of the Director, CVE, to approve or deny an application will be in writing. A decision to deny verification status will state the specific reasons for denial, and will inform the applicant of any appeal rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the Director, CVE, approves the application, the date of the approval letter is the date of participant verification for purposes of determining the participant's verification eligibility term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The decision may be sent by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means.
