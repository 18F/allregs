                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General--when fault is relevant. If you request waiver of recovery of an overpayment, we must determine whether you were without fault. You are not relieved of liability and are not without fault solely because we may have been at fault in making the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The factors we consider to determine whether you were without fault. When

we determine whether you were without fault, we consider all the pertinent circumstances relating to the overpayment. We consider your understanding of your obligation to give us information affecting your payments, your agreement to report events, your knowledge of the occurrence of events that should have been reported, the efforts you made to comply with the reporting requirements, the opportunities you had to comply with the reporting requirements, your ability to comply with the reporting requirements (e.g., your age, comprehension, memory, physical and mental condition), and your understanding of the obligation to return payments that were not due. In determining whether you are without fault based on these factors, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or language limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) you may have. We will determine that you were at fault if, after considering all of the circumstances, we find that the overpayment resulted from one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your failure to furnish information which you knew or should have known was material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An incorrect statement you made which you knew or should have known was incorrect (this includes furnishing your opinion or conclusion when you were asked for facts), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You did not return a payment, which you knew, or could have been expected to know, was incorrect.</p>
