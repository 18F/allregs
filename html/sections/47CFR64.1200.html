If a sender obtains the facsimile number from the recipient's own directory, advertisement, or Internet site, it will be presumed that the number was voluntarily made available for public distribution, unless such materials explicitly note that unsolicited advertisements are not accepted at the specified facsimile number. If a sender obtains the facsimile number from other sources, the sender must take reasonable steps to verify that the recipient agreed to make the number available for public distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> This clause shall not apply in the case of an unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an established business relationship with the recipient that was in existence before July 9, 2005 if the sender also possessed the facsimile machine number of the recipient before July 9, 2005. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that if a valid established business relationship was formed prior to July 9, 2005, the sender possessed the facsimile number prior to such date as well; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The advertisement contains a notice that informs the recipient of the ability and means to avoid future unsolicited advertisements. A notice contained in an advertisement complies with the requirements under this paragraph only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the advertisement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The notice states that the recipient may make a request to the sender of the advertisement not to send any future advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply, within 30 days, with such a request meeting the requirements under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section is unlawful;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The notice sets forth the requirements for an opt-out request under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The notice includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A domestic contact telephone number and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If neither the required telephone number nor facsimile machine number is a toll-free number, a separate cost-free mechanism including a Web site address or email address, for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the advertisement.

The recipient's opt-out request terminates the established

business relationship exemption for purposes of sending future unsolicited advertisements. If such requests are recorded or maintained by a party other than the sender on whose behalf the unsolicited advertisement is sent, the sender will be liable for any failures to honor the opt-out request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A facsimile broadcaster will be liable for violations of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, including the inclusion of opt-out notices on unsolicited advertisements, if it demonstrates a high degree of involvement in, or actual notice of, the unlawful activity and fails to take steps to prevent such facsimile transmissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use an automatic telephone dialing system in such a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business are engaged simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disconnect an unanswered telemarketing call prior to at least 15 seconds or four (4) rings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Abandon more than three percent of all telemarketing calls that are answered live by a person, as measured over a 30-day period for a single calling campaign. If a single calling campaign exceeds a 30-day period, the abandonment rate shall be calculated separately for each successive 30-day period or portion thereof that such calling campaign continues. A call is ``abandoned'' if it is not connected to a live sales representative within two (2) seconds of the called person's completed greeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a live sales representative is not available to speak with the person answering the call, within two (2) seconds after the called person's completed greeting, the telemarketer or the seller must provide:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A prerecorded identification and opt-out message that is limited to disclosing that the call was for ``telemarketing purposes'' and states the name of the business, entity, or individual on whose behalf the call was placed, and a telephone number for such business, entity, or individual that permits the called person to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign; provided, that, such telephone number may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism that enables the called person to make a do-not-call request prior to terminating the call, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism. When the called person elects to opt-out using such mechanism, the mechanism must automatically record the called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A call for telemarketing purposes that delivers an artificial or prerecorded voice message to a residential telephone line or to any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section after the subscriber to such line has granted prior express written consent for the call to be made shall not be considered an abandoned call if the message begins within two (2) seconds of the called person's completed greeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The seller or telemarketer must maintain records establishing compliance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Calls made by or on behalf of tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not covered by this paragraph (a)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Use any technology to dial any telephone number for the purpose of determining whether the line is a facsimile or voice line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All artificial or prerecorded voice telephone messages shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call. If a business is responsible for initiating the call, the name under which the entity is registered to conduct business with the State Corporation Commission (or comparable regulatory authority) must be stated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During or after the message, state clearly the telephone number (other than that of the autodialer or prerecorded message player that placed the call) of such business, other entity, or individual. The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges

exceed local or long distance transmission charges. For telemarketing messages to residential telephone subscribers, such telephone number must permit any individual to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In every case where the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes telemarketing and is delivered to a residential telephone line or any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii), provide an automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism for the called person to make a do-not-call request, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism, within two (2) seconds of providing the identification information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the called person elects to opt out using such mechanism, the mechanism, must automatically record the called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call. When the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message is left on an answering machine or a voice mail service, such message must also provide a toll free number that enables the called person to call back at a later time and connect directly to the automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism and automatically record the called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any residential telephone subscriber before the hour of 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. (local time at the called party's location), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone number on the national do-not-call registry of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations that is maintained by the Federal Government. Such do-not-call registrations must be honored indefinitely, or until the registration is cancelled by the consumer or the telephone number is removed by the database administrator. Any person or entity making telephone solicitations (or on whose behalf telephone solicitations are made) will not be liable for violating this requirement if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It can demonstrate that the violation is the result of error and that as part of its routine business practice, it meets the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Written procedures. It has established and implemented written procedures to comply with the national do-not-call rules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Training of personnel. It has trained its personnel, and any entity assisting in its compliance, in procedures established pursuant to the national do-not-call rules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Recording.

It uses a process to prevent telephone solicitations to any telephone number on any list established pursuant to the do-not-call rules, employing a version of the national do-not-call registry obtained from the administrator of the registry no more than 31 days prior to the date any call is made, and maintains records documenting this process.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D): The requirement in paragraph 64.1200(c)(2)(i)(D) for persons or entities to employ a version of the national do-not-call registry obtained from the administrator no more than 31 days prior to the date any call is made is effective January 1, 2005. Until January 1, 2005, persons or entities must continue to employ a version of the registry obtained from the administrator of the registry no more than three months prior to the date any call is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Purchasing the national do-not-call database. It uses a process to ensure that it does not sell, rent, lease, purchase or use the national do-not-call database, or any part thereof, for any purpose except compliance with this section and any such state or federal law to prevent telephone solicitations to telephone numbers registered on the national database. It purchases access to the relevant do-not-call data from the administrator of the national database and does not participate in any arrangement to share the cost of accessing the national database, including any arrangement with telemarketers who may not divide the

costs to access the national database among various client sellers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It has obtained the subscriber's prior express invitation or permission. Such permission must be evidenced by a signed, written agreement between the consumer and seller which states that the consumer agrees to be contacted by this seller and includes the telephone number to which the calls may be placed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The telemarketer making the call has a personal relationship with the recipient of the call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No person or entity shall initiate any call for telemarketing purposes to a residential telephone subscriber unless such person or entity has instituted procedures for maintaining a list of persons who request not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of that person or entity. The procedures instituted must meet the following minimum standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Written policy. Persons or entities making calls for telemarketing purposes must have a written policy, available upon demand, for maintaining a do-not-call list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Training of personnel engaged in telemarketing. Personnel engaged in any aspect of telemarketing must be informed and trained in the existence and use of the do-not-call list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recording, disclosure of do-not-call requests. If a person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes (or on whose behalf such a call is made) receives a request from a residential telephone subscriber not to receive calls from that person or entity, the person or entity must record the request and place the subscriber's name, if provided, and telephone number on the do-not-call list at the time the request is made. Persons or entities making calls for telemarketing purposes (or on whose behalf such calls are made) must honor a residential subscriber's do-not-call request within a reasonable time from the date such request is made. This period may not exceed thirty days from the date of such request. If such requests are recorded or maintained by a party other than the person or entity on whose behalf the telemarketing call is made, the person or entity on whose behalf the telemarketing call is made will be liable for any failures to honor the do-not-call request. A person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes must obtain a consumer's prior express permission to share or forward the consumer's request not to be called to a party other than the person or entity on whose behalf a telemarketing call is made or an affiliated entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identification of sellers and telemarketers. A person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes must provide the called party with the name of the individual caller, the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made, and a telephone number or address at which the person or entity may be contacted. The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Affiliated persons or entities. In the absence of a specific request by the subscriber to the contrary, a residential subscriber's do-not-call request shall apply to the particular business entity making the call (or on whose behalf a call is made), and will not apply to affiliated entities unless the consumer reasonably would expect them to be included given the identification of the caller and the product being advertised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Maintenance of do-not-call lists. A person or entity making calls for telemarketing purposes must maintain a record of a consumer's request not to receive further telemarketing calls. A do-not-call request must be honored for 5 years from the time the request is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not required to comply with 64.1200(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The rules set forth in paragraph (c) and (d) of this section are applicable to any person or entity making telephone solicitations or telemarketing calls to wireless telephone numbers to the extent described in the Commission's Report and Order, CG Docket No. 02-278, FCC 03-153, ``Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> As used in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term advertisement means any material advertising the commercial
