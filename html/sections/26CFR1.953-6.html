                                Sec. 1.953-6  Relationship of sections 953 and 954.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Priority of application. For purposes of determining the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation under section 952 for any taxable year, the provisions of section 954, relating to foreign base company income, shall be applied, after first applying section 953, only with respect to income which is not income derived from the insurance of United States risks under section 953. For example, the provisions of section 954 may be applied with respect to the income of a controlled foreign corporation which is not income derived from the insurance of United States risks under section 953 because such corporation does not satisfy the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.953-1, even though such corporation has taxable income, as determined under Sec. 1.953-4, which is attributable to the reinsuring or the issuing of any insurance or annuity contracts in connection with United States risks. In addition, the provisions of section 954 may apply with respect to the income of a controlled foreign corporation to the extent such income is not allocated or apportioned under Sec. 1.953-4 to the insurance of United States risks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decrease in income not material. It is not material that the income of a controlled foreign corporation is decreased as a result of the application of paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, in applying Sec. 1.953-4 to the income of a controlled foreign corporation described in paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.953-5 which would, but for paragraph (a) of this section, be subject to the provisions of section 954, there shall be allowed, in determining the taxable income derived from the insurance of United States risks under Sec. 1.953-4, a deduction under section 809(a)(1) for the share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders; it is not material that in determining foreign base company income such deduction would not be allowed under section 954(b)(5). Further, income of a controlled foreign corporation which is required to be taken into account under section 953 in determining income derived from the insurance of United States risks and would, but for the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, constitute foreign base company income under section 954 shall not be taken into account under section 954(b)(3)(B) in determining whether foreign base company income exceeds 70 percent of gross income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Increase in income not material. It is not material that the income of a controlled foreign corporation is increased as a result of the application of paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, in applying Sec. 1.953-4 to income of a controlled foreign corporation which

would, but for paragraph (a) of this section, be subject to the provisions of section 954, it is not material that the dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of stock or securities derived from certain investments which would not be included in foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(3)(B) are included under section 953 in income derived from the insurance of United States risks. Further, income of a controlled foreign corporation which is required to be taken into account under section 953 in determining income derived from the insurance of United States risks and would, but for paragraph (a) of this section, constitute foreign base company income shall not be excluded under section 954(b)(3)(A) for the taxable year.
