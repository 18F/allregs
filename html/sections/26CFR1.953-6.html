                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Priority of application. For purposes of determining the subpart  F income of a controlled foreign corporation under section 952 for any  taxable year, the provisions of section 954, relating to foreign base  company income, shall be applied, after first applying section 953, only  with respect to income which is not income derived from the insurance of  United States risks under section 953. For example, the provisions of  section 954 may be applied with respect to the income of a controlled  foreign corporation which is not income derived from the insurance of  United States risks under section 953 because such corporation does not  satisfy the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.953-1, even though such corporation has taxable  income, as determined under Sec. 1.953-4, which is attributable to the  reinsuring or the issuing of any insurance or annuity contracts in  connection with United States risks. In addition, the provisions of  section 954 may apply with respect to the income of a controlled foreign  corporation to the extent such income is not allocated or apportioned  under Sec. 1.953-4 to the insurance of United States risks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)(B)</em> in determining whether  foreign base company income exceeds 70 percent of gross income for the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)(B)</em> are included  under section 953 in income derived from the insurance of United States  risks. Further, income of a controlled foreign corporation which is  required to be taken into account under section 953 in determining  income derived from the insurance of United States risks and would, but  for paragraph (a) of this section, constitute foreign base company  income shall not be excluded under section 954(b)(3)(A) for the taxable  year.
