The remedy coordination official shall submit to the agency head a written report setting forth the remedy coordination official's findings that support each recommendation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving a recommendation from the remedy coordination official under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the agency head shall determine whether substantial evidence exists that the request for payment under a contract is based on fraud.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the agency head determines that substantial evidence exists, the agency head may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under the affected contract(s).

reasonable time, in response to the action proposed by the remedy coordination official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When more than one agency has contracts affected by the fraud, the agencies shall consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the determination and decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The agency shall retain in its files the written justification for each--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Decision of the agency head whether to reduce or suspend further payments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recommendation received by an agency head in connection with such decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Not later than 180 calendar days after the date of the reduction or suspension action, the remedy coordination official shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review the agency head's determination on which the reduction or suspension decision is based; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmit a recommendation to the agency head as to whether the reduction or suspension should continue.
