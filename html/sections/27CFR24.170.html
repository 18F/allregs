The appropriate TTB officer may at any time  require proprietors to provide at their own expense equipment for  ascertaining the capacity and contents of tanks and other storage  containers, and scales and measuring devices for weighing and measuring  wine, spirits, volatile fruit-flavor concentrate, or materials received  and used in the production or treatment of wine. Where winemaking  materials or other materials used in the treatment of wine are used  immediately upon receipt on wine premises, or received and stored on  bonded wine premises in original sealed shipping containers with a  stated capacity, the quantity shown on the commercial invoice or other  document covering the shipment may be accepted by the proprietor and  entered into records in lieu of measuring the materials upon receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing instruments. The proprietor shall have ready access to  equipment for determining the alcohol content unless the proprietor only  receives and stores on wine premises bottled or packed wine with  evidence showing the alcohol content has been determined. The proprietor  who bottles or packs wine shall have ready access to equipment for  determining the net contents of bottled or packed wine. The appropriate  TTB officer may require other testing instruments based upon the  proprietor's operations.  (Sec. 201, Pub.
