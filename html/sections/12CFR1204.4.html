                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How will FHFA or FHFA-OIG locate the requested records? FHFA or FHFA-OIG will search to determine if requested records exist in the system of records it owns or controls. You can find FHFA and FHFA-OIG system of records notices on our Web site at http://www.fhfa.gov. You can also find descriptions of OFHEO and FHFB system of records that have not yet been superseded on the FHFA Web site. A description of the system of records also is available in the ``Privacy Act Issuances'' compilation published by the Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and Records Administration. You can access the ``Privacy Act Issuances'' compilation in most large reference and university libraries or electronically at the Government Printing Office Web site at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/privacyact/index.html. You also can request a copy of FHFA or FHFA-OIG system of records from the Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How long does FHFA or FHFA-OIG have to respond? Either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer generally will respond to your request in writing within 20 days after receiving it, if it meets the Sec. 1204.3 requirements. For requests to amend a record, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer will respond within 10 days after receipt of the request to amend. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may extend the response time in unusual circumstances, such as when consultation is needed with another Federal agency (if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act) about a record or to retrieve a record shipped offsite for storage. If you submit your written request in person, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer may disclose records or information to you directly and create a written record of the grant of the request. If you are to be accompanied by another person when accessing your record or any information pertaining to you, FHFA or FHFA-OIG may require your written authorization before permitting access or discussing the record in the presence of the other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What will the FHFA or FHFA-OIG response include? The written response will include a determination to grant or deny your request in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and the amount of the fee charged, if any, under Sec. 1204.6. If you are granted a request to access a record, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will make the record available to you. If you are granted a request to amend or correct a record, the response will describe any amendments or corrections made and advise you of your right to obtain a

copy of the amended or corrected record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What is an adverse determination? An adverse determination is a determination on a Privacy Act request that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withholds any requested record in whole or in part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denies a request for an amendment or correction of a record in whole or in part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Declines to provide a requested accounting of disclosures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advises that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Finds what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What will be stated in a response that includes an adverse determination? If an adverse determination is made with respect to your request, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer's written response under this section will identify the person responsible for the adverse determination, state that the adverse determination is not a final action of FHFA or FHFA-OIG, and state that you may appeal the adverse determination under Sec. 1204.5.</p>
