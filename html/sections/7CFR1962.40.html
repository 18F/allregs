                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary liquidation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. When a borrower contacts the  agency and asks about voluntarily liquidating security, the borrower  will be sent attachments 1 and 2 of exhibit A of subpart S of part 1951  of this chapter or attachments 1, 3 and 4, and the preliminary  application forms by certified mail, or the forms will be hand delivered  at the County Office. The servicing notices which provide possible  alternatives to liquidation provide a maximum of 60 days for the  borrower to apply for servicing. Therefore, the agency will not discuss  liquidation or methods of liquidation until 60 days after the borrower  receives the notices except in serious situations which are documented  in detail in the case file. During the 60-day time period the County  Supervisor may answer questions regarding the servicing notices. After  60 days, the borrower will be told that liquidation can be accomplished  by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selling the security under Sec. 1962.41 of this subpart,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transferring the security under Sec. 1962.34 of this subpart,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conveying the security to the agency under Subpart A of Part  1955 of this chapter, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Refinancing the debt with another lender.  The provisions of these regulations will be explained to the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lien search. The County Supervisor will obtain a current lien  search report to determine the effect that liens of other parties will  have on liquidation, the record lienholders to whom notices of sale will  be given, and the distribution that will be made of the sales proceeds.  Normally, lien searches should be obtained from the same source as is  used when making a loan. If obtaining the searches from third party  sources causes undue delay which interferes with orderly liquidation,  searches may be made by the County Supervisor. If the lien search is  made by third parties, the borrower will pay the cost from personal  funds or if the borrower refuses, the agency will pay the cost and  charge it to the borrower's account in accordance with the security  instrument or EO Loan Agreement. The records to be searched and the  period covered by the search will be in accordance with a State  supplement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Involuntary liquidation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. When a borrower makes an  unapproved disposition of security, the directions in Sec. Sec. 1962.18  and 1962.49 of this subpart will be followed. In all other cases, when  the County Supervisor,   with the advice of the District Director, determines that continued  servicing of the loan will not accomplish the objectives of the loan, or  that further servicing cannot be justified under the policy stated in  Sec. 1962.2 of this subpart, liquidation of the account(s) will be  accomplished as quickly as possible under this section and subpart A of  part 1955 of this chapter. When liquidation is begun, it is the agency  policy to liquidate all security and EO property, except EO property  that the County Supervisor determines is essential for minimum family  living needs. The present market value of security that may be retained  by the borrower for minimum family living needs will not exceed $600.  However, only so much of the security and EO property will be liquidated  as necessary to pay the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section. The County Supervisor will then  attempt to repossess the security in accordance with Sec. 1962.42 of  this subpart. If this is not possible, the case will be referred for  civil action in accordance with Sec. 1962.49 of this subpart. Unmatured  installments will be accelerated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The District Director will accelerate all unmatured installments  by using exhibits D, E, or E-1 of subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter  except in cases referred to OGC for civil action, if the notice has  previously been given.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exhibits D, E, or E-1 of subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter  will be sent to the last known address of each obligor, with a copy to  the Finance Office in those cases referred to OGC for civil action.  County Office and Finance Office loan records will be adjusted to mature  the entire indebtedness only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lien search. The County Supervisor will follow the directions  set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of subpart A of part  1965 of this chapter for liquidating these loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of direct loans. When liquidation of a direct loan is  approved, the State Director will be asked by the official who approved  the liquidation to immediately obtain an assignment of the loan to if  the promissory note is not held in the County Office. Pending the  assignment, preliminary steps to effect liquidation should be taken, but  civil or other court action will not be started and claims will not be  filed in bankruptcy or similar proceedings or in probate or  administration proceedings with respect to the insured loan claim,  unless essential to protect Government's interests and OGC recommends  such action. However, other steps need not be held up pending  assignment. If any problems are encountered in obtaining the assignment,  OGC may be contacted for advice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protective advances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After attachments 1 and 2 or 1, 3, and  4 of exhibit A of subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter have been sent  and if security is in danger of loss or deterioration, the State  Director will protect Government's interest and approve protective  advances in payment of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Delinquent taxes or assessments that constitute prior liens  which would be paid ahead of the Agency under Sec. 1962.44(a) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Premiums on insurance essential to protect FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's interest, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other costs including transportation necessary to protect or  preserve the security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, such advances may not be made unless the amount  advanced becomes a part of the debt secured by the Agency's lien, or is  for expenses of administration of estates or for litigation. If a case  is in the hands of the U.S. Attorney, such advances may not be made  without the U.S. Attorney's concurrence. Moreover, such advances may not  be made in any case to pay expenses incurred by a U.S. Marshal or other  similar official such as a local sheriff. However, if the official  seizes the property and delivers it to the Agency for sale by the  Agency, costs incurred by the Agency after delivery to the Agency will  be paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The County Supervisor will submit a report on the need for such  advances to the State Director, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Borrower's County Office case file;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Current lien search report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Statement of the type and value of the property and of the  circumstances which may result in the loss or deterioration of such  property; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A recommendation as to whether or not the advance should be  approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a borrower's security property is liquidated voluntarily or  involuntarily and there is an unpaid balance on the account, the County  Supervisor will meet with the borrower within 30 days to assist the  borrower in developing a debt settlement offer in accordance with  subpart B of part 1956 of this chapter.
