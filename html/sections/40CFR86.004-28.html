Deterioration factors shall be established  using applicable emissions test procedures. NOX plus NMHC  deterioration factors shall be established based on the sum of the  pollutants. When establishing deterioration factors for NOX  plus NMHC, a negative deterioration (emissions decrease from the  official exhaust emissions test result) for one pollutant may not offset  deterioration of the other pollutant. Where negative deterioration  occurs for NOX and/or NMHC, the official exhaust emission  test result shall be used for purposes of determining the NOX  plus NMHC deterioration factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined  from tests of engines, subsystems, or components conducted by the  manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. For  Otto-cycle engines, separate factors shall be established for transient  NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NOX. NOX plus NMHC, and idle CO,  for those engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalytic  converters). For diesel-cycle engines, separate factors shall be  established for transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NOX.  NOX plus NMHC and exhaust particulate. For diesel-cycle smoke  testing, separate factors shall also be established for the acceleration  mode (designated as ``A''), the lugging mode (designated as ``B''), and  peak opacity (designated as ``C'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> (1) and (2) of this section apply  to Otto-cycle HDEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Otto-cycle HDEs not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g.,  catalytic converters). For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NOX.  the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at  the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the  appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor  supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the  purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>  prior to the use of the additive deterioration factor. The Administrator  may consider the results of the in-use verification testing both in  certification and in-use compliance programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section applies to diesel-cycle  HDEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. Except as  specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, use an  additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive  deterioration factor for a pollutant is the difference between exhaust  emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the  low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission  results for each tested engine at the selected test point by adding the  factor to the measured emissions. If the factor is less than zero, use  zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one more  decimal place than the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. Use a  multiplicative deterioration factor if good engineering judgment calls  for the deterioration factor for a pollutant to be the ratio of exhaust  emissions at the end of the useful life to exhaust emissions at the low- hour test point. For example, if you use aftertreatment technology that  controls emissions of a pollutant proportionally to engine-out  emissions, it is often appropriate to use a multiplicative deterioration  factor. Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at  the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the  deterioration factor. If the factor is less than one, use one. A  multiplicative deterioration factor may not be appropriate in cases  where testing variability is significantly greater than engine-to-engine  variability. Multiplicative deterioration factors must be specified to  one more significant figure than the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Diesel-cycle HDEs only. For acceleration smoke (``A''), lugging  smoke (``B''), and peak smoke (``C''), the official exhaust emission  results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall  be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor.  However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is  less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii))</em>, for each emission data engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> and (6) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all  applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as  determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, before any engine in  that family will be certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For the purposes of setting an NMHC plus NOX  certification level or FEL for a diesel-fueled engine family, the  manufacturer may use one of the following options for the determination  of NMHC for an engine family. The manufacturer must declare which option  is used in its application for certification of that engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> THC may be used in lieu of NMHC for the standards set forth in  Sec. 86.004-11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer may choose its own method to analyze methane  with prior approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer may assume that two percent of the measured  THC is methane (NMHC =0.98 x THC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (d) of this section applies to heavy-duty vehicles  equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicable evaporative emission standards in this subpart  apply to the emissions of vehicles for their useful life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For vehicles with a GVWR of up to 26,000 pounds, because it  is expected   that emission control efficiency will change during the useful life of  the vehicle, an evaporative emission deterioration factor shall be  determined from the testing described in Sec. 86.098-23(b)(3) for each  evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system  combination to indicate the evaporative emission control system  deterioration during the useful life of the vehicle (minimum 50,000  miles). The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to  the right of the decimal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> shall include, in accordance with good  engineering practice, consideration of control system deterioration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The evaporative emission test results, if any, shall be adjusted  by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor, provided that  if the deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for  the purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The emission level to compare with the standard shall be the  adjusted emission level of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Before any  emission value is compared with the standard, it shall be rounded, in  accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (as referenced in Sec. 86.094-28  (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii)), to two significant figures. The rounded emission  values may not exceed the standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply  with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph  (d)(5) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be  certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)-(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.001-28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Development of adjustment factors. Manufacturers must develop  separate pairs of adjustment factors (an upward adjustment factor and a  downward adjustment factor) for each pollutant based on measured  emission data and observed regeneration frequency. Adjustment factors  may be carried-over to subsequent model years or carried-across to other  engine families only where the Administrator determines that such carry- over or carry-across is consistent with good engineering judgment.  Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family,  but manufacturers may develop separate adjustment factors for different  engine configurations within an engine family. All adjustment factors  for regeneration are additive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculation of adjustment factors. The adjustment factors are  calculated from the following parameters: the measured emissions from a  test in which the regeneration occurs (EFH), the measured  emissions from a test in which the regeneration does not occur  (EFL), and the frequency of the regeneration event in terms  of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs (F). The  average emission rate (EFA) is calculated as:  EFA = (F)(EFH) + (1 - F)(EFL)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The upward adjustment factor (UAF) is calculated as: UAF =  EFA - EFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The downward adjustment factor (DAF) is calculated as: DAF =  EFA - EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of adjustment factors. Upward adjustment factors are added  to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration does  not occur. Downward adjustment factors are added to measured emission  rates for all tests in which the regeneration occurs. The occurrence of  the regeneration must be identified in a manner that is readily apparent  during all testing. Where no regeneration is identified, the upward  adjustment factor shall be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sample calculation. If EFL is 0.10 g/bhp-hr,  EFH is 0.50 g/bhp-hr, and F is 0.1 (i.e., the regeneration  occurs once for each ten tests), then:  EFA = (0.1)(0.5 g/bhp-hr) + (1.0 - 0.1)(0.1 g/bhp-hr) = 0.14  g/bhp-hr UAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.10 g/bhp-hr = 0.04 g/bhp-hr DAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.50 g/bhp-hr = -0.36 g/bhp-hr</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Options. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A manufacturer may elect to omit adjustment factors  for one or more of its engine families (or configurations) because the  effect of the regeneration is small, or because it is not practical to  identify when regenerations occur. In these cases, no upward or downward  adjustment factor shall be added, and the manufacturer is liable for  compliance with the emission standards for all tests, without regard to  whether a regeneration occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator may account  for regeneration events differently than is provided in this paragraph  (i). However, this option only applies for events that occur extremely  infrequently, and which cannot be practically addressed using the  adjustment factors described in this paragraph (i).
