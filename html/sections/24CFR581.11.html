HUD  will inform landholding agencies or GSA if appeal of an unsuitability  determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to  Sec.  581.4(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain  from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its  reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no  appeal has been filed after 20   days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with  disposal action in accordance with applicable law.</p>
