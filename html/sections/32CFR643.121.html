Installation commanders may authorize the use of available facilities or space to such private organizations, without monetary consideration, when the use is on a nonexclusive basis and subject to immediate termination when possession is required by the installation commander for another purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the private organization desires exclusive use of facilities or space, or for a specified period of time, the matter will be considered a leasing action, the lease will be granted by the DE and will provide for payment of a rental consideration. The installation commander will consult with the DE if there is a question whether a proposed use of facilities or space by a private organization should be authorized by the DE under lease or by the installation commander by the issuance of a license.</p>
