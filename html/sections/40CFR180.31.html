Subject to the requirements of FFDCA section 408(e), a temporary tolerance or exemption from a tolerance may be revoked if the experimental permit is revoked, or may be revoked at any time if it develops that the application for a temporary tolerance contains a misstatement of a material fact or that new scientific data or experience with the pesticide chemical indicates that it does not meet the safety standard in FFDCA section 408(b)(2) or (c), as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions under which a temporary tolerance is established shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A limitation on the amount of the chemical to be used on the designated crops permitted under the experimental permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A limitation for the use of the chemical on the designated crops to bona fide experimental use by qualified persons as indicated in the experimental permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requirement that the person or firm which obtains the experimental permit for which the temporary tolerance is established will immediately inform the Environmental Protection Agency of any reports on findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A requirement that the person or firm which obtained the experimental permit for which the temporary tolerance is established will keep records of

production, distribution, and performance for a period of 2 years and, on request, at any reasonable time, make these records available to any authorized officer or employee of the Environmental Protection Agency.
