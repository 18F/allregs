                            <p class="depth0">When we learn that your interest is not served by sending your  benefit payment to your present representative payee or that your  present payee is no longer able or willing to carry out payee  responsibilities, we will promptly stop sending your payment to the  payee. We will then send your benefit payment to an alternative payee or  directly to you, until we find a suitable payee. We may suspend payment  as explained in Sec. 404.2011(c) if we find that paying you directly  would cause substantial harm and we cannot find a suitable alternative  representative payee before your next payment is due. We will terminate  payment of benefits to your representative payee and find a new payee or  pay you directly if the present payee:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Has been found by us or a court of competent jurisdiction to  have misused your benefits;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Has not used the benefit payments on your behalf in accordance  with the guidelines in this subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Has not carried out the other responsibilities described in this  subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dies;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No longer wishes to be your payee;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Is unable to manage your benefit payments; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fails to cooperate, within a reasonable time, in providing  evidence, accounting, or other information we request.
