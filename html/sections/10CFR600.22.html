Informal resolution, including resolution through an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, shall be preferred over formal procedures, to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Before issuing a final determination in any dispute in which informal resolution has not been achieved, the Contracting Officer shall suggest that the other party consider the use of voluntary consensual methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation. The DOE dispute resolution specialist is available to provide assistance for such disputes, as are trained mediators of other federal agencies. ADR may be used at any stage of a dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final determination.

The mailing address for the NNSA SPE is Office of Acquisition and Supply Management, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of appeal. The filing of an appeal with the SPE shall not stay any determination or action taken by DOE which is the subject of the appeal. Consistent with its obligation to protect the interests of the Federal Government, DOE may take such authorized actions as may be necessary to preserve the status quo pending decision by the SPE, or to preserve its ability to provide relief in the event the SPE decides in favor of the appellant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review on appeal.
