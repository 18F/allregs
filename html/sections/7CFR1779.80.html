                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Subject to the restrictions below, the borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively effect a permanent reduction in the interest rate on the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan on written agreement by all of the applicable parties. After such a permanent reduction, the Loan Note Guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate. The Agency must be notified by the lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the change. When the Agency is a holder, it will concur only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the Government's financial interests are not adversely affected. Factors which will be considered in making such determination are the Government's cost of borrowing money and the project's enhancement of rural development. The monetary recovery must be greater than the liquidation recovery, and a financial feasibility analysis must show the project's continued viability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fixed rates cannot be changed to variable rates to reduce the interest rate to the borrower unless the variable rate has a ceiling which is less than the original fixed rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Variable rates can be changed to a lower fixed rate. In a final loss settlement when qualifying rate changes are made with the required written agreements and notification, the interest will be calculated for the periods the given rates were in effect. The lender

must maintain records which adequately document the accrued interest claimed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest rate changes. However, the lender may not issue a new note.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Increases. No increases in interest rates will be permitted under the loan guarantee except the normal fluctuations in approved variable interest rate loans.</p>
