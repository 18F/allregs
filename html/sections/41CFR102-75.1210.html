HUD will inform landholding agencies or GSA, if a representative of the homeless files an appeal of unsuitability pursuant to Sec. 102-75.1175(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">No Applications Approved</p>
