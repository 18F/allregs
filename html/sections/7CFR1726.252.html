Where the borrower anticipates difficulty in obtaining responsive bids on RUS standard contract forms due to a lack of limitation with respect to special and consequential damages, and where the borrower believes that such a modification will encourage competition through the receipt of an alternative bid which limits the bidder's liability for special and consequential damages, the borrower may make the following approved phrase modifications in the RUS standard contract form on which the borrower solicits bids:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insert new paragraphs in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders'' as follows:</p><p class="depth2">``Proposals are invited on the basis of alternative Liability Clause Numbers 1 and 2. The Owner will determine on which Liability Clause basis the award will be made. Any other liability clauses in the proposal or any other modifications will be considered not responsive and unacceptable. These Liability Clauses are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Liability Clause Number 1. This will include unmodified all of the standard terms and conditions of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto.</p><p class="depth2">Liability Clause Number 2. This will include the following paragraph, in addition to all of the standard terms and conditions, otherwise unmodified, of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto:</p><p class="depth2">``Except for the Bidder's willful delay or refusal to perform the contract in accordance with its terms, the Bidder's liability to the Owner for special or consequential damages on account of breach of this contract shall not exceed in total an amount equal to ---- percent [the borrower will insert an appropriate percentage between 0 and 100 percent, inclusive] of the contract price.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Insert the following in the contract documents under the ``Proposal'' section:
