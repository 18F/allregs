                                Sec. 779.209  Vertical activities which are ``related activities.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Senate Report also states (see Sec. 779.206 that activities are ``related'' when they are ``part of a vertical structure such as the manufacturing,

warehousing, and retailing of a particular product or products.'' Where such activities are performed through unified operation or common control for a common business purpose they will be regarded as a part of the enterprise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether activities are vertically ``related'' activities and part of a single enterprise, or whether they constitute separate businesses are separate enterprises, depends upon the facts in each case. In all of these cases of so-called ``vertical operations,'' the determination whether the activities are ``related,'' depends upon the extent to which the various business activities, such as a wholesaling and retailing or manufacturing and retailing, are interrelated and interdependent and are performed to serve a business objective common to all. The mere fact that they are under common ownership is not, by itself, sufficient to bring them within the same enterprise. Thus, where a manufacturing business is carried on separately from and wholly independently of a retail business, with neither serving the business purpose of the other, they are separate businesses even if they are under common ownership. However, where the manufacturing operations are performed in substantial part for the purpose of distributing the goods through the retail stores, or the retail outlet serves to carry out a business purpose of the manufacturing plant, retailing and manufacturing will be ``related'' activities and performed for a ``common business purpose,'' and they will be a single enterprise if they are performed through unified operations or common control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In these cases of ``vertical operations'' a practical judgment will be required to determine whether the activities are maintained and operated as separate and distinct businesses with different objectives or whether they, in fact, constitute a single integrated business enterprise. The answer necessarily will depend upon all the facts in each case.</p>
