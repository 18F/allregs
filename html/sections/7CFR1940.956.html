                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. In order for a State to become or remain an eligible State, the State must have a rural economic development panel that meets all requirements of this subpart. Each designated State will establish a schedule whereby the panel and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will coordinate the submission, review, and ranking process of preapplications/applications. The schedule will be submitted to the Under Secretary for concurrence and should consider the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timeframes should assure that applications selected for funding from the current FY's allocation of funds can be processed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and funds obligated prior to the July 15 pooling established in Sec. 1940.961(c) of this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial submission of preapplications/applications from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the panel and any subsequent submissions during the first year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> How often during each FY thereafter should FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 submit preapplications/applications to the panel for review and ranking;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Number of working days needed by the panel to review and rank preapplications/applications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Number of times during the FY the panel will submit a list of ranked preapplications/applications to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for funding consideration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consider the matching of available loan and grant funds to assure that all allocated funds will be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> How to consider ranked preapplications/applications at the end of the FY that have not been funded; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> How to consider requests for additional funds needed by an applicant to complete a project that already has funds approved; i.e., construction bid cost overrun.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duties and responsibilities. The panel is required to advise the State Director on the desirability of funding applications from funds available to the State from designated rural development programs. In relation to this advice, the panel will have the following duties and responsibilities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish policy and criteria to review and evaluate area plans and to review and rank preapplications/applications. (i) Area plan. The panel will develop a written policy and criteria to use when evaluating area plans. The criteria to be used when evaluating area plans will assure that the plan includes, as a minimum, the technical information included in Sec. 1940.959 of this subpart. The criteria will be in sufficient detail for the panel to determine that the plan is technically and economically adequate, feasible, and likely to succeed in meeting the stated goals of the plan. The panel will give weight to area-wide or regional plans and comments submitted by intergovernmental development councils or similar organizations made up of local elected officials charged with the responsibility for rural area or regional development. A copy of the policy and evaluating criteria will be provided to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Area plan.

The panel will annually review the policy and criteria used by the panel to evaluate and rank preapplications/applications in accordance with this subpart. The panel will assure that the policy and criteria are consistent with current rural development needs, and that the public has an opportunity to provide input during the development of the initial policy and criteria. The Governor will provide a copy of the initial policy and criteria established by the panel when submitting evidence of eligibility in accordance with Sec. 1940.954 of this subpart. Annually, thereafter, and not later than September 1 of each FY, the State coordinator will send the Under Secretary evidence that the panel has reviewed the established policy and criteria. The State coordinator will also send the Under Secretary a copy of all revisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The policy and criteria used to rank applications for business related projects will include the following, which are not necessarily in rank order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which a project stimulate rural development by creating new jobs of a permanent nature or retaining existing jobs by enabling new small businesses to be started, or existing businesses to be expanded by local or regional area residents who own and operate the businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which a project will contribute to the enhancement and the diversification of the local or regional area economy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which a project will generate or retain jobs for local or regional area residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which a project will be carried out by persons with sufficient management capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which a project is likely to become successful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which a project will assist a local or regional area overcome severe economic distress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The distribution of assistance to projects in as many areas as possible in the State with sensitivity to geographic distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The technical aspects of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The market potential and marketing arrangement for the projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The potential of such project to promote the growth of a rural community by improving the ability of the community to increase the number of persons residing in the community and by improving the quality of life for these persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The policy and criteria used to rank preapplications/applications for infrastructure and all other community facility-type projects will include the following which are not necessarily in rank order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which the project will have the potential to promote the growth of a rural community by improving the quality of life for local or regional residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the project will affect the health and safety of local or regional area residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the project will improve or enhance cultural activities, public service, education, or transportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which the project will affect business productivity and efficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which the project will enhance commercial business activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which the project will address a severe loss or lack of water quality or quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the project will correct a waste collection or disposal problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The extent to which the project will bring a community into compliance with Federal or State water or waste water standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The extent to which the project will consolidate water and waste systems and utilize management efficiencies in the new system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review and evaluate area plans. Each area plan submitted for a local or regional area will be reviewed and evaluated by the panel. After an area plan has been reviewed and evaluated in accordance with established policy and criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The panel will accept any area plan that meets established criteria unless the plan is incompatible with any other area plan for that area that has been accepted by the panel; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The panel will return any area plan that is technically or economically inadequate, not feasible, is unlikely to be successful, or is not compatible with other panel-accepted area plans for that area. When an area plan is returned, the panel will include an explanation of the reasons for the return and suggest alternative proposals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State coordinator will notify the State Director, in writing, of the panel's decision on each area plan reviewed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Review and rank preapplications/applications. The panel will review, rank, and transmit a ranked list of preapplications/applications according to the schedule prepared in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review preapplications/applications. The panel will review each preapplication/application for assistance to determine if the project to be carried out is compatible with the area plan in which the project described in the preapplication/application is proposed, and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Accept any preapplication/application determined to be compatible with such area plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Return to the State Director any preapplication/application determined not to be compatible with such area plan. The panel will notify the applicant when preapplication/applications are returned to the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rank preapplications/applications. The panel will rank only those preapplications/applications that have been accepted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.

In addition to the criteria established in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, preapplications/applications for projects designed to address a health emergency declared so by the appropriate Federal or State agency, will be given priority by the panel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Priority based on need. If two or more preapplications/applications ranked in accordance with this subpart are determined to have comparable strengths in their feasibility and potential for growth, the panel will give priority to the applications for projects with the greatest need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If additional ranking criteria for use by a panel are required in any designated rural development program regulation, the panel will give consideration to the criteria when ranking preapplications/applications submitted under that program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transmit list of ranked preapplications/applications. After the preapplications/applications have been ranked, the panel will submit a list of all preapplications/applications received to the State coordinator. The list will clearly indicate each preapplication/application accepted for funding and will list preapplications/applications in the order established for funding according to priority ranking by the panel. The list will not include a preapplication/application that is to be returned to the applicant in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section. The State coordinator will send a copy of the list to the State Director for further processing of the preapplication/application in accordance with Sec. 1940.965 of this subpart. Once the panel has ranked and submitted the list to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the State Director has selected a preapplication/application for funding, the preapplication/application selected will not be replaced with a preapplication/application received at a later date that may have a higher ranking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public availability of list. If requested, the State coordinator will make the list of ranked preapplications/applications available to the public and will include a brief explanation and justification of why the project preapplications/applications received their priority ranking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Membership--(1) Voting members.
