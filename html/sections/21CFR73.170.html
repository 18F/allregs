                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive grape skin extract (enocianina)  is a purplish-red liquid prepared by the aqueous extraction (steeping)  of the fresh deseeded marc remaining after grapes have been pressed to  produce grape juice or wine. It contains the common components of grape  juice; namely, anthocyanins, tartaric acid, tannins, sugars, minerals,  etc., but not in the same proportions as found in grape juice. During  the steeping process, sulphur dioxide is added and most of the extracted  sugars are fermented to alcohol. The extract is concentrated by vacuum  evaporation, during which practically all of the alcohol is removed. A  small amount of sulphur dioxide may be present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Color additive mixtures for food use made with grape skin  extract (enocianina) may contain only those diluents listed in this  subpart as safe and suitable in color additive mixtures for coloring  foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. Grape skin extract (enocianina) shall conform to  the following specifications:  Pesticide residues, not more than permitted in or on grapes by  regulations promulgated under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act. Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million. Arsenic (as As), not more than 1 part per million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. Grape skin extract (enocianina) may be  safely used for the coloring of still and carbonated drinks and ades,  beverage bases, and alcoholic beverages subject to the following  restrictions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It may not be used to color foods for which standards of  identity have been promulgated under section 401 of the act unless  artificial color is authorized by such standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Its use in alcoholic beverages shall be in accordance with the  provisions of parts 4 and 5, title 27 CFR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling requirements. The label of the color additive and any  mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring  purposes shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this  chapter. The common or usual name of the color additive is ``grape skin  extract'' followed, if desired, by ``(enocianina)''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color  additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and  therefore batches thereof are exempt from the certification requirements  of section 721(c) of the act.</p>
