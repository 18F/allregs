                            <p class="depth0">The contracting officer needs to consider requirements for both  periodic audits and award-specific audits (as defined in Sec. 603.1295  and Sec. 603.1220, respectively). The way that an expenditure-based TIA  addresses the two types of audits will vary, depending upon the type of  for-profit participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, gives  the necessary access in the event that the contracting officer later  needs to request audits to address award-specific issues that arise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each other for-profit participant, the contracting officer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Should require that the participant have an independent auditor  (i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant (IPA)) conduct  periodic audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year  in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards. A prime reason for  including this requirement is that the Federal Government, for an  expenditure-based award, necessarily relies on amounts reported by the  participant's systems when it sets payment amounts or adjusts  performance outcomes. The periodic audit provides some assurance that  the reported amounts are reliable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must ensure that the award provides an independent auditor the  access needed for award-specific audits, to be performed at the request  of the contracting officer if issues arise that require audit support.  However, consistent with the government-wide policies on single audits  that apply to nonprofit participants (see Sec. 603.665), the contracting  officer should rely on periodic audits to the maximum extent possible to  resolve any award-specific issues.</p>
