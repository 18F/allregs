                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to make a FOIA request. Requests for records made pursuant  to the FOIA must be in writing. Requests should be sent to the National  Indian Gaming Commission, Attn: FOIA Officer, 1441 L Street, NW., Suite  9100, Washington, DC 20005. Requests may be mailed, dropped off in  person, or faxed to (202) 632-7066 (not a toll free number). If the  requester is making a request for records about himself/herself, the  requester should see 25 CFR 515.3 for additional information. If the  requester is making a request for records about another individual, the  requester must provide either a written authorization signed by that  individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester or  provide proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of  the death certificate or a copy of the obituary).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records sought. Requests for records shall  describe the records requested with as much specificity as possible to  enable Commission employees to locate the information requested with a  reasonable amount of effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> for more information). If the request for a fee  waiver is denied, the requester will be notified of this decision and  advised that fees associated with the processing of the request will be  assessed. The requester must send an acknowledgment to the FOIA Officer  indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such  acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be  considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request  will be administratively closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Types of records not available. The FOIA does not require the  Commission to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a  request for records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may  be expected to come into existence at some future time; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that  the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records  have been destroyed or disposed.</p>
