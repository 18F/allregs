                                Sec. 3.52  Simple risk-weight approach (SRWA).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Under the SRWA, a national bank's or Federal savings  association's total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures equals the  sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's  or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures (other than  equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined under this section  and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or  Federal savings association's individual equity exposures to an  investment fund as determined under Sec. 3.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Zero percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to  a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European  Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund,  an MDB, and any other entity whose credit exposures receive a zero  percent risk weight under Sec. 3.32 may be assigned a zero percent risk  weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 20 percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to a  PSE, Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage  Corporation (Farmer Mac) must be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> must be assigned a 100 percent risk  weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Community development equity exposures. An equity exposure that  qualifies as a community development investment under section 24  (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an  unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures  held through a consolidated small business investment company described  in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective portion of hedge pairs. The effective portion of a  hedge pair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-significant equity exposures. Equity exposures, excluding  significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial  institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment  firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were  it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition in  Sec. 3.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that  the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed  10 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total  capital.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a national  bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures for purposes of  this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may  exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2),  (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a  hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of  each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of  the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that  meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a national  bank or Federal savings association does not know the actual holdings of  the investment fund, the national bank or Federal savings association  may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not  equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership  agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible  investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure  classes within   the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings  association must assume for purposes of this section that the investment  fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When determining which of a national bank's or Federal savings  association's equity exposures qualify for a 100 percent risk weight  under this paragraph (b), a national bank or Federal savings association  first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business  investment companies or held through consolidated small business  investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business  Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures  (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then  must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held  indirectly through investment funds).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 250 percent risk weight equity exposures. Significant  investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in  the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to  Sec. 3.22(d) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 300 percent risk weight equity exposures. A publicly traded  equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph  (b)(7) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge  pair) must be assigned a 300 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 400 percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure  (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7)) of this  section that is not publicly traded must be assigned a 400 percent risk  weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 600 percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to  an investment firm must be assigned a 600 percent risk weight, provided  that the investment firm:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were  it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has greater than immaterial leverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hedge transactions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hedge pair. A hedge pair is two equity  exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure  is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly  traded equity exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective hedge. Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if  the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a  remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is  formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the  national bank or Federal savings association acquires at least one of  the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of  effectiveness (E) the national bank or Federal savings association will  use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction;  and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A  national bank or Federal savings association must measure E at least  quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E as set  forth in this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the  national bank or Federal savings association must determine the ratio of  value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the  changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the  changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive,  the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and  greater than or equal to -1 (that is, between zero and -1), then E  equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than -1,  then E equals 2 plus RVC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under the variability-reduction method of measuring  effectiveness:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC13.027</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E  equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the  change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent  variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair  is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression  coefficient is positive, then E equals zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the  greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming  a hedge pair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by  the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures  forming a hedge pair.</p>
