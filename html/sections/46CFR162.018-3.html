Consideration of lower melting materials for  internal pressure-containing parts will be given if their use provides  significant improvement to the general operation of the valve. Flange  gaskets shall be metal or spiral wound asbestos.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonferrous materials shall not be used in the construction of  valves for anhydrous ammonia or other service where susceptible to  attack by the lading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The seats and disks shall be of suitable corrosion resistant  material. Seats and disks of cast iron or malleable iron shall not be  used. Springs shall be of best quality spring steel consistent with the  design of the valve and the service requirement.
