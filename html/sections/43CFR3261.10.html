Send us a complete operations plan (see Sec. 3261.12) and an acceptable bond with your Sundry Notice. You may start well pad construction after we approve your Sundry Notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you already have an approved drilling permit and you have provided an acceptable bond, you do not need any further permission from BLM to start well pad construction, unless you intend to change something in the approved permit. If you propose a change in an approved permit, send us a completed and signed Sundry Notice so we may review your proposed change. Do not proceed with the change until we approve your Sundry Notice.</p>
