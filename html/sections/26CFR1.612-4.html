                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Option with respect to intangible drilling and development  costs. In accordance with the provisions of section 263(c), intangible  drilling and development costs incurred by an operator (one who holds a  working or operating interest in any tract or parcel of land either as a  fee owner or under a lease or any other form of contract granting  working or operating rights) in the development of oil and gas  properties may at his option be chargeable to capital or to expense.  This option applies to all expenditures made by an operator for wages,  fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, etc., incident to and necessary for  the drilling of wells and the preparation of wells for the production of  oil or gas. Such expenditures have for convenience been termed  intangible drilling and development costs. They include the cost to  operators of any drilling or development work (excluding amounts payable  only out of production or gross or net proceeds from production, if such  amounts are depletable income to the recipient, and amounts properly  allocable to cost of depreciable property) done for them by contractors  under any form of contract, including turnkey contracts. Examples of  items to which this option applies are, all amounts paid for labor,  fuel, repairs, hauling, and supplies, or any of them, which are used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the drilling, shooting, and cleaning of wells,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In such clearing of ground, draining, road making, surveying,  and geological works as are necessary in preparation for the drilling of  wells, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the construction of such derricks, tanks, pipelines, and  other physical structures as are necessary for the drilling of wells and  the preparation of wells for the production of oil or gas.   In general, this option applies only to expenditures for those drilling  and developing items which in themselves do not have a salvage value.  For the purpose of this option, labor, fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies,  etc., are not considered as having a salvage value, even though used in  connection with the installation of physical property which has a  salvage value. Included in this option are all costs of drilling and  development undertaken (directly or through a contract) by an operator  of an oil and gas property whether incurred by him prior or subsequent  to the formal grant or assignment to him of operating rights (a  leasehold interest, or other form of operating rights, or working  interest); except that in any case where any drilling or development  project is undertaken for the grant or assignment of a fraction of the  operating rights, only that part of the costs thereof which is  attributable to such fractional interest is within this option. In the  excepted cases, costs of the project undertaken, including depreciable  equipment furnished, to the extent allocable to fractions of the  operating rights held by others, must be capitalized as the depletable  capital cost of the fractional interest thus acquired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery of optional items, if capitalized. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Items returnable  through depletion: If the taxpayer charges such expenditures as fall  within the option to capital account, the amounts so capitalized and not  deducted as a loss are returnable through depletion insofar as they are  not represented by physical property. For the purposes of this section  the expenditures for clearing ground, draining, road making, surveying,  geological work, excavation, grading, and the drilling, shooting, and  cleaning of wells, are considered not to be represented by physical  property, and when charged to capital account are returnable through  depletion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Items returnable through depreciation: If the taxpayer charges  such expenditures as fall within the option to capital account, the  amounts so capitalized and not deducted as a loss are returnable through  depreciation insofar as they are represented by physical property. Such  expenditures are amounts paid for wages, fuel, repairs, hauling,  supplies, etc., used in the installation of casing and equipment and in  the construction on the property of derricks and other physical  structures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of capitalized intangible drilling and development  costs incurred under a contract, such costs shall be allocated between  the foregoing classes of items specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2)  for the purpose of determining the depletion and depreciation  allowances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Option with respect to cost of nonproductive wells: If the  operator has elected to capitalize intangible drilling and development  costs, then an additional option is accorded with respect to intangible  drilling and development costs incurred in drilling a nonproductive  well. Such costs incurred in drilling a nonproductive well may be  deducted by the taxpayer as an ordinary loss provided a proper election  is made in the return for the first taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1942, in which such a nonproductive well is completed. Such  election with respect to intangible drilling and development costs of  nonproductive wells is a new election, and, when made, shall be binding  for all subsequent years. Any taxpayer who incurs optional drilling and  development costs in drilling a nonproductive well must make a clear  statement of election under this option in the return for the first  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1942, in which such  nonproductive well is completed. The absence of a clear indication in  such return of an election to deduct as ordinary losses intangible  drilling and development costs of nonproductive wells shall be deemed to  be an election to recover such costs through depletion to the extent  that they are not represented by physical property, and through  depreciation to the extent   that they are represented by physical property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonoptional items distinguished. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Capital items: The option  with respect to intangible drilling and development costs does not apply  to expenditures by which the taxpayer acquires tangible property  ordinarily considered as having a salvage value. Examples of such items  are the costs of the actual materials in those structures which are  constructed in the wells and on the property, and the cost of drilling  tools, pipe, casing, tubing, tanks, engines, boilers, machines, etc. The  option does not apply to any expenditure for wages, fuel, repairs,  hauling, supplies, etc., in connection with equipment, facilities, or  structures, not incident to or necessary for the drilling of wells, such  as structures for storing or treating oil or gas. These are capital  items and are returnable through depreciation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expense items: Expenditures which must be charged off as  expense, regardless of the option provided by this section, are those  for labor, fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, etc., in connection with  the operation of the wells and of other facilities on the property for  the production of oil or gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manner of making election. The option granted in paragraph (a)  of this section to charge intangible drilling and development costs to  expense may be exercised by claiming intangible drilling and development  costs as a deduction on the taxpayer's return for the first taxable year  in which the taxpayer pays or incurs such costs; no formal statement is  necessary. If the taxpayer fails to deduct such costs as expenses in  such return, he shall be deemed to have elected to recover such costs  through depletion to the extent that they are not represented by  physical property, and through depreciation to the extent that they are  represented by physical property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of option and election. This section does not grant a new  option under paragraph (a) of this section or new election under  paragraph (b) of this section. Section 3 of the Act of October 23, 1962  (Public Law 87-863, 76 Stat. 1142) granted any taxpayer who had  exercised an option to capitalize intangible drilling and development  costs under Regulations 111, Sec. 29.23(m)-16 (1939 Code) or Regulations  118, Sec. 39.23(m)-16 (1939 Code) a new option for the first taxable  year ending after October 22, 1962, to deduct such costs as expenses.  Unless he has exercised the new option granted by such Act, any taxpayer  who exercised an option or made an election under the regulations  described in the preceding sentence is, by such option or election,  bound with respect to all intangible drilling and development costs  (whether made before January 1, 1954, or after December 31, 1953) in  connection with oil and gas properties. See section 7807(b)(2). Any  taxpayer who has not made intangible drilling and development  expenditures in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1942,  prior to his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and  ending after August 16, 1954, must exercise the option granted in  paragraph (a) of this section in the return for the first taxable year  in which the taxpayer pays or incurs such expenditures. If such return  is required by law (including extensions thereof) to be filed before  November 1, 1965, the option under paragraph (a) of this section, or the  election under paragraph (b) of this section, may be exercised or  changed not later than November 1, 1965. The exercise of or change in  such option or election shall be effective with respect to the earliest  taxable year to which the option or election is applicable in respect of  which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment,  as the case may be, resulting from such exercise or change is not  prevented by any law or rule of law on the date such option is exercised  or such election is made. Any such option or election shall be binding  upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which it is effective  and for all subsequent taxable years.  [T.D. 6836, 30 FR 8902, July 15, 1965]</p>
