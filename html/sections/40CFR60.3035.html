                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test data for at least three consecutive annual tests, and all performance tests for the pollutant over that period show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If your OSWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for that pollutant every 3rd year, but each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission limitation for any pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until three consecutive annual performance tests for that pollutant all show compliance.</p>
