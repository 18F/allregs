                                Sec. 225.137  Acquisitions of shares pursuant to section 4(c)(6)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board has received a request for an interpretation of  section 4(c)(6) of the Bank Holding Company Act   (``Act'') \1\ in connection with a proposal under which a number of bank  holding companies would purchase interests in an insurance company to be  formed for the purpose of underwriting or reinsuring credit life and  credit accident and health insurance sold in connection with extensions  of credit by the stockholder bank holding companies and their  affiliates. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ It should be noted that every Board Order granting approval  under section 4(c)(8) of the Act contains the following paragraph:</p><p class="depth2">``This determination is subject . . . to the Board's authority to  require such modification or termination of the activities of a holding  company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to  assure compliance with the provisions and purposes of the Act and the  Board's regulations and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasion  thereof.''</p><p class="depth2">The Board believes that, even apart from this Interpretation, this  language preserves the authority of the Board to require the revisions  contemplated in this Interpretation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each participating holding company would own no more than 5  percent of the outstanding voting shares of the company. However, the  investment of each holding company would be represented by a separate  class of voting security, so that each stockholder would own 100 percent  of its respective class. The participating companies would execute a  formal ``Agreement Among Stockholders'' under which each would agree to  use its best efforts at all times to direct or recommend to customers  and clients the placement of their life, accident and health insurance  directly or indirectly with the company. Such credit-related insurance  placed with the company would be identified in the records of the  company as having been originated by the respective stockholder. A  separate capital account would be maintained for each stockholder  consisting of the original capital contribution increased or decreased  from time to time by the net profit or loss resulting from the insurance  business attributable to each stockholder. Thus, each stockholder would  receive a return on its investment based upon the claims experience and  profitability of the insurance business that it had itself generated.  Dividends declared by the board of directors of the company would be  payable to each stockholder only out of the earned surplus reflected in  the respective stockholder's capital account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(6)</em> of the Act provides an exemption under which  participating bank holding companies may acquire such interests in the  company without prior approval of the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On the basis of a careful review of the documents submitted, in  light of the purposes and provisions of the Act, the Board has concluded  that section 4(c)(6) of the Act is inapplicable to this proposal and  that a bank holding company must obtain the approval of the Board before  participating in such a proposal in the manner described. The Board's  conclusion is based upon the following considerations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act provides that a company is deemed  to have control over a second company if it owns or controls ``25 per  centum or more of any class of voting securities'' of the second  company. In the case presented, the stock interest of each participant  would be evidenced by a different class of stock and each would  accordingly, own 100 percent of a class of voting securities of the  company. Thus, each of the stockholders would be deemed to ``control''  the company and prior Board approval would be required for each  stockholder's acquisition of stock in the company.  The Board believes that this application of section 2(a)(2)(A) of the  Act is particularly appropriate on the facts presented here. The company  is, in practical effect, a conglomeration of separate business ventures  each owned 100 percent by a stockholder the value of whose economic  interest in the company is determined by reference to the profits and  losses attributable to its respective class of stock. Furthermore, it is  the Board's opinion that this application of section 2(a)(2)(A) is not  inconsistent with section 4(c)(6). Even assuming that section (4)(c)(6)  is intended to refer to all outstanding voting shares, and not merely  the outstanding shares of a particular class of securities, section  4(c)(6) must be viewed as permitting ownership of 5 percent of a  company's voting stock only when that ownership does not   constitute ``control'' as otherwise defined in the Act. For example, it  is entirely possible that a company could exercise a controlling  influence over the management and policies of a second company, and thus  ``control'' that company under the Act's definitions, even though it  held less than 5 percent of the voting stock of the second company. To  view section 4(c)(6) as an unqualified exemption for holdings of less  than 5 percent would thus create a serious gap in the coverage of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board believes that section 4(c)(6) should properly be  interpreted as creating an exemption from the general prohibitions in  section 4 on ownership of stock in nonbank companies only for passive  investments amounting to not more than 5 percent of a company's  outstanding stock, and that the exemption was not intended to allow a  group of holding companies, through concerted action, to engage in an  activity as entrepreneurs. Section 4 of the Act, of course, prohibits  not only owning stock in nonbank companies, but engaging in activities  other than banking or those activities permitted by the Board under  section 4(c)(8) as being closely related to banking. Thus, if a holding  company may be deemed to be engaging in an activity through the medium  of a company in which it owns less than 5 percent of the voting stock it  may nevertheless require Board approval, despite the section 4(c)(6)  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To accept the argument that section 4(c)(6) is an unqualified  grant of permission to a bank holding company to own 5 percent of the  shares of any nonbanking company irrespective of the nature or extent of  the holding company's participation in the affairs of the nonbanking  company would, in the Board's view, create the potential for serious and  widespread evasion of the Act's controls over nonbanking activities.  Such a construction would allow a group of 20 bank holding companies--or  even a single bank holding company and one or more nonbank companies--to  engage in entrepreneurial joint ventures in businesses prohibited to  bank holding companies, a result the Board believes to be contrary to  the intent of Congress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In this proposal, each of the participating stockholders must be  viewed as engaging in the business of insurance underwriting. Each  stockholder would agree to channel to the company the insurance business  it generates, and the value of the interest of each stockholder would be  determined by reference to the profitability of the business generated  by that stockholder itself. There is no sharing or pooling among  stockholders of underwriting risks assumed by the company, and profit or  loss from investments is allocated on the basis of each bank holding  company's allocable underwriting profit or loss. The interest of each  stockholder is thus clearly that of an entrepreneur rather than that of  an investor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accordingly, on the basis of the factual situation before the  Board, and for the reasons summarized above, the Board has concluded  that section 4(c)(6) of the Act cannot be interpreted to exempt the  ownership of 5 percent of the voting stock of a company under the  circumstances described, and that a bank holding company wishing to  become a stockholder in a company under this proposal would be required  to obtain the Board's approval to do so.
