                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">All persons must cooperate with any official of the DOL assigned to perform an investigation, inspection, or law enforcement function pursuant to the INA and these regulations during the performance of such duties. The WHD will take such action as it deems appropriate, including seeking an injunction to bar any failure to cooperate with an investigation and/or assessing a civil money penalty therefore. In addition, the WHD will report the matter to ETA, and the WHD may recommend to ETA the debarment of the employer from future certification and/or recommend that the person's existing labor certification be revoked. In addition, Federal statutes prohibiting persons from interfering with a Federal officer in the course of official duties are found at 18 U.S.C. 111 and 18 U.S.C. 1114.</p>
