Provided, however, That  nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prohibit the Board  from disposing of routine or administrative matters by sequential,  notational voting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where agency business is disposed of by notational voting as  provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the minutes of the next  succeeding Board meeting shall reflect such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Every portion of every meeting of the Board at which agency  business is conducted or disposed of shall be open to public  observation, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in this section, every portion of every  meeting of the Board shall be open to the public. A meeting or a portion  of a meeting may be closed where (i) the Board properly determines that  the subject matter of the meeting or portion thereof is such as to make  it likely that disclosure of matters falling within one or more of the  exceptions set out in paragraph (c)(3) of this section would result, and  (ii) the Board determines that the public interest would not require  that the meeting or portion thereof be open to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall  not apply to information pertaining to a meeting which would otherwise  be required to be disclosed to the public under this section where the  Board properly determines that the disclosure of the information is  likely to disclose matters within the exceptions listed in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section, and that the public interest would not require  that the matters, even though excepted, should be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board may close a meeting or a portion thereof and may  withhold information concerning the meeting or portion thereof,  including the explanation of closure, the description of the subject  matter of the meeting, and the list of individuals expected to attend,  which otherwise would be required to be made public under paragraphs (d)  and (e) of this section, where it has determined, as provided in  paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, where it has determined, as  provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, that the public  interest would not otherwise require that the meeting or portion thereof  be open or that the information be made public, and that the   meeting, or portion thereof, or the disclosure of the information is  likely to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disclose matters that are (A) specifically authorized under  criteria established by Executive Order to be kept secret in the  interests of national defense or foreign policy and (B) in fact properly  classified pursuant to such executive order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of  the Board;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Disclose matters exempted from disclosure under 45 U.S.C.  362(d) and 362(n) and 45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(3) or disclose matters  specifically exempted from disclosure by any other statute (other than 5  U.S.C 552), Provided, That such other statute either requires that the  matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to afford no  discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for  withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information  obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring  any person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure  would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement  purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such  records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or  information would</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Interfere with law enforcement proceedings,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial  adjudication,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case  of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the  course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful  national security intelligence investigation, confidential information  furnished only by the confidential source,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement  personnel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would  be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Board  action, except that this paragraph shall not apply in any instance where  the Board has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of  its proposed action, or where the Board is required by law to make such  disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final agency action on  such proposal;

A single vote may be taken with  respect to a series of meetings, to close the meetings or portions  thereof or to withhold information pertaining to such meetings, where  the meetings or portions thereof involve the same subject matter and are  scheduled within 30 calendar days after the date of the initial meeting  in the series.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vote of each member of the Board participating in the vote  on closure of a meeting or portion thereof shall be recorded. Vote by  proxy shall not be allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(v)</em>, (vi), or (vii) of this section. The  request should be directed to The Secretary, Railroad Retirement Board,  844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, and must be received no   later than the beginning of the meeting to which it applies. Upon  receipt of such a request the Board shall vote by recorded vote on the  question as to whether the meeting or portion thereof should be closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within one day following a vote taken under paragraphs (d)(2)  and (3) of this section, a copy of such vote showing the vote of each  member shall be available for public inspection and copying in the  office of the Secretary of the Board, located in the Board's  headquarters office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a meeting or portion thereof is closed in accordance with an  action under paragraphs (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the Board shall,  within one day following the vote, except to the extent such information  is exempt from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, make  available for inspection and copying in the office of the Secretary of  the Board a written explanation of the Board's action and a list of the  persons expected to attend and their affiliations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as to those meetings or portions of meetings scheduled  as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the Board  shall for each meeting make public announcement at least one week prior  thereto of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, whether  the meeting is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and  telephone number of an official of the Railroad Retirement Board  designated by the Board to respond to any requests from the public  pertaining to the meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement contained in paragraph (e)(1) of this section  that the Board give one week advance notice of each meeting shall not  apply where the Board determines by majority vote, which vote shall be  recorded, that agency business requires that a meeting be scheduled at  an earlier date. If a meeting is scheduled less than one week in the  future, as provided in this paragraph, the Board shall make a public  announcement at the earliest practicable time of the time, place and  subject matter of the meeting and whether the meeting is to be open or  closed to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board may change the time and place of a previously  scheduled and announced meeting, but such change must be announced to  the public at the earliest practicable time. The Board may change the  subject matter, or its determination to open or close a meeting or  portion thereof, of a previously scheduled and announced meeting only if  (i) a majority of the Board determines by recorded vote that agency  business requires the change and that no earlier public announcement of  the change was possible, and (ii) the Board makes a public announcement  of the change and the vote of each member thereon at the earliest  practicable time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Immediately following each public announcement required by this  subsection, the Board shall submit for publication in the Federal  Register notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting,  whether the meeting is to be open or closed, any changes in such items  from a previous announcement, and the name and telephone number of the  Railroad Retirement Board official designated by the Board to respond to  requests concerning the announced meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the Board should determine to close a meeting or a  portion of a meeting under any of the exemptions contained in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section, the General Counsel of the Railroad Retirement  Board shall, prior to the meeting, certify in writing that in his or her  opinion the meeting or portion thereof may be closed to the public and  shall state the applicable exemptions which permit closure. The Board  shall maintain a copy of the General Counsel's certification and a copy  of the statement of the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth  the time and place of the meeting and a list of the persons present,  other than those present merely as spectators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that a meeting or any portion of a meeting is  closed to the public, a complete transcript or recording shall be made  of the meeting or portion thereof closed; Provided, however, That if the  meeting or portion thereof is closed under paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this  section, a set of minutes may be made of the closed meeting or portion  of a meeting in lieu of a complete transcript or recording thereof. If a  set of minutes is the method   chosen to record the proceedings of a meeting or portion thereof closed  under paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section, such minutes shall fully and  clearly describe the matters discussed. The minutes shall also fully  reflect any actions taken by the Board, set forth a statement of the  reasons for such actions, summarize each of the views expressed  concerning such actions, identify any documents considered in connection  with such agency actions, and show the vote of the Board and each of its  members on such actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transcript, recording, or minutes of each meeting or portion  thereof closed to the public shall be available for public inspection or  listening in the office of the Secretary of the Board, 844 Rush Street,  Chicago, Illinois 60611, no later than two weeks following the meeting.  There shall be expunged or erased from the transcript, recording, or  minutes of each meeting which is made available to the public any items  of discussion or testimony when it has been determined that they contain  information which may be withheld under paragraph (c) of this section,  and that the public interest would not require disclosure. The  determination as to what items of discussion or testimony shall be  expunged or erased from the copies of the transcript, recording, or  minutes available to the public shall be made by the Secretary of the  Board with the approval of the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of transcripts, minutes, or transcriptions of recordings  maintained by the Board as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section  shall be provided to members of the public who request such copies, at  the actual cost of duplicating or transcription. Requests for copies of  transcripts, minutes or transcriptions of recordings should be in  writing, addressed to the Secretary of the Board, Railroad Retirement  Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, and should clearly  indicate the date of the meeting or meetings for which such copies are  requested.
