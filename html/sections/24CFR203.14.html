Such  agreement must provide that upon the sale or conveyance of the dwelling  and delivery of the warranty, the seller, builder or such other person  will promptly furnish the Secretary with a conformed copy of the  warranty establishing by the purchaser's receipt thereon that the  original warranty has been delivered to the purchaser in accordance with  this section.
