This definition also includes final adverse actions rendered by a Federal or state licensing or certification authority, such as exclusions, revocations, or suspension of license or certification, that occur in conjunction with settlements in which no finding of liability has been made (although such a settlement itself is not reportable under the statute). This definition excludes administrative fines or citations and corrective action plans and other personnel actions, unless they are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Connected to the delivery of health care services; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Taken in conjunction with other adverse licensure or certification actions such as revocation, suspension, censure, reprimand, probation, or surrender.</p><p class="depth0">Organization name means the subject's business or employer at the time the underlying acts occurred. If more than one business or employer is applicable, the one most closely related to the underlying acts should be reported as the ``organization name,'' with the others being reported as ``affiliated or associated health care entities.''</p><p class="depth0">Organization type means a description of the nature of that business or employer.</p><p class="depth0">Other adjudicated actions or decisions means formal or official final actions taken against a health care practitioner, provider, or supplier by a Federal governmental agency, a state law or fraud enforcement agency, or a health plan, which include the availability of a due process mechanism, and are based on acts or omissions that affect or could affect the payment, provision, or delivery of a health care item or service. For example, a formal or official final action taken by a Federal governmental agency, a state law or fraud enforcement agency, or a health plan may include, but is not limited to, a personnel-related action such as suspensions without pay, reductions in pay, reductions in grade for cause, terminations, or other comparable actions. A hallmark of any valid adjudicated action or decision is the availability of a due process mechanism. The fact that the subject elects not to use the due process mechanism provided by the authority bringing the action is immaterial, as long as such a process is available to the subject before the adjudicated action or decision is made final. In general, if an ``adjudicated action or decision'' follows an agency's established administrative procedures (which ensure that due process is available to the subject of the final adverse action), it would qualify as a reportable action under this definition. This definition specifically excludes clinical privileging actions taken by Federal Government agencies or state law and fraud enforcement agencies and similar paneling decisions made by health plans. This definition does not include overpayment determinations made by Federal or state government programs, their contractors or health plans, and it does not include denial of claims determinations made by Federal Government agencies, state law or fraud enforcement agencies, or health plans. This definition also does not include business or administrative decisions taken by health plans that result in contract terminations unrelated to health care fraud or abuse or quality of care (e.g., when a practitioner's contract is terminated because the practitioner no longer practices at a facility in the health plan's network, or a health plan terminates all provider contracts in a certain geographic area because it ceases business operations in that area). For health plans that are not government entities, an action taken following adequate notice and the opportunity for a hearing that meets the standards of

due process set out in section 412(b) of the HCQIA (42 U.S.C. 11112(b)) also would qualify as a reportable action under this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Peer review organization means, for purposes of this part, an organization with the primary purpose of evaluating the quality of patient care practices or services ordered or performed by health care practitioners measured against objective criteria which define acceptable and adequate practice through an evaluation by a sufficient number of health care practitioners in such an area to ensure adequate peer review. The organization has due process mechanisms available to health care practitioners. This definition excludes utilization and quality control peer review organizations described in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (referred to as QIOs) and other organizations funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to support the QIO program.</p><p class="depth0">Physician means, for purposes of this part, a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine or surgery by a state (or who, without authority, holds himself or herself out to be so authorized).</p><p class="depth0">Private accreditation entity means an entity or organization that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Evaluates and seeks to improve the quality of health care provided by a health care entity, provider, or supplier;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Measures a health care entity's, provider's, or supplier's performance based on a set of standards and assigns a level of accreditation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Conducts ongoing assessments and periodic reviews of the quality of health care provided by a health care entity, provider, or supplier; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Has due process mechanisms available to health care entities, providers, or suppliers.</p><p class="depth0">Professional review action means an action or recommendation of a health care entity:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Taken in the course of professional review activity;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Based on the professional competence or professional conduct of an individual health care practitioner which affects or could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient or patients; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Which adversely affects or may adversely affect the clinical privileges or membership in a professional society of the health care practitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> This term excludes actions which are primarily based on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The health care practitioner's association, or lack of association, with a professional society or association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The health care practitioner's fees or the health care practitioner's advertising or engaging in other competitive acts intended to solicit or retain business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The health care practitioner's participation in prepaid group health plans, salaried employment, or any other manner of delivering health services whether on a fee-for-service or other basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> A health care practitioner's association with, supervision of, delegation of authority to, support for, training of, or participation in a private group practice with, a member or members of a particular class of health care practitioner or professional; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Any other matter that does not relate to the competence or professional conduct of a health care practitioner.</p><p class="depth0">Professional review activity means an activity of a health care entity with respect to an individual health care practitioner:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> To determine whether the health care practitioner may have clinical privileges with respect to, or membership in, the entity;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> To determine the scope or conditions of such privileges or membership; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> To change or modify such privileges or membership.</p><p class="depth0">Quality Improvement Organization means a utilization and quality control peer review organization (as defined in part B of title XI of the Social Security Act) that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)(i)</em> Is composed of a substantial number of the licensed doctors of medicine and osteopathy engaged in the practice of medicine or surgery in the area and who are representative of the practicing physicians in the area, designated by the Secretary under section 1153, with respect to which the entity shall perform services under this part, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Is composed of a substantial number of the licensed doctors of medicine and osteopathy engaged in the practice of medicine or surgery in the area and who are representative of the practicing physicians in the area, designated by the Secretary under section 1153, with respect to which the entity shall perform services under this part, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Has available to it, by arrangement or otherwise, the services of a sufficient number of licensed doctors of medicine or osteopathy engaged in the practice of medicine or surgery in such area to assure that adequate peer review of the services provided by the various medical specialties and subspecialties can be assured;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Is able, in the judgment of the Secretary, to perform review functions required under section 1154 in a manner consistent with the efficient and effective administration of this part and to perform reviews of the pattern of quality of care in an area of medical practice where actual performance is measured against objective criteria which define acceptable and adequate practice; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Has at least one individual who is a representative of consumers on its governing body.</p><p class="depth0">Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.</p><p class="depth0">State means the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth0">State law or fraud enforcement agency includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A state law enforcement agency;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A state Medicaid fraud control unit (as defined in section 1903(q) of the Social Security Act);
