                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Wage order proceedings are initiated by order of the Secretary,  published in the Federal Register, giving notice of hearings by industry  committees to recommend the minimum rate or rates of wages to be paid  under section 6 of the Act to employees in American Samoa engaged in  commerce or in the production of goods for commerce or in any enterprise  engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. These  orders will contain a definition of the particular industry in American  Samoa, for which the committee is to make its recommendations, or these  orders will direct the committee to recommend the minimum rate or rates  of wages for all industry in American Samoa. All such orders will make  provision for convening the committee. Any particular industry defined  in such an order may be a trade, business, industry, or branch thereof,  or group of industries, in which individuals are gainfully employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These orders will also give reasonable notice (1) of the time  and place of the commencement of the hearing of such witnesses and  receiving of such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate to enable  the committee to perform its duties and functions under the Act, (2) of  the general nature of the wage order proceedings and the authority under  which they are proposed, (3) of the subjects and issues involved, and  (4) that the committee will take official notice of the economic report  (note Sec. 511.13) and the parties will have an opportunity at the  hearing to show any contrary or additional facts.
