Appendix II to Part 921--Typology of National Estuarine Research</p><p class="depth0">Reserves</p><p class="depth0">This typology system reflects significant differences in estuarine  characteristics that are not necessarily related to regional location.  The purpose of this type of classification is to maximize ecosystem  variety in the selection of national estuarine reserves. Priority will  be given to important ecosystem types as yet unrepresented in the  reserve system. It should be noted that any one site may represent  several ecosystem types or physical characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">Class I--Ecosystem Types</p><p class="depth0">Group I--Shorelands</p><p class="depth0">A. Maritime Forest-Woodland. That have developed under the influence  of salt spray. It can be found on coastal uplands or recent features  such as barrier islands and beaches, and may be divided into the  following biomes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Northern coniferous forest biome: This is an area of  predominantly evergreens such as the sitka spruce (Picea), grand fir  (Abies), and white cedar (Thuja), with poor development of the shrub and  herb leyera, but high annual productivity and pronounced seasonal  periodicity.</p><p class="depth0">2. Moist temperate (Mesothermal) coniferous forest biome: Found  along the west coast of North America from California to Alaska, this  area is dominated by conifers, has relatively small seasonal range, high  humidity with rainfall ranging from 30 to 150 inches, and a well- developed understory of vegetation with an abundance of mosses and other  moisture-tolerant plants.</p><p class="depth0">3. Temperate deciduous forest biome: This biome is characterized by  abundant, evenly distributed rainfall, moderate temperatures which  exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern,   well-developed soil biota and herb and shrub layers, and numerous plants  which produce pulpy fruits and nuts. A distinct subdivision of this  biome is the pine edible forest of the southeastern coastal plain, in  which only a small portion of the area is occupied by climax vegetation,  although it has large areas covered by edaphic climax pines.</p><p class="depth0">4. Broad-leaved evergreen subtropical forest biome: The main  characteristic of this biome is high moisture with less pronounced  differences between winter and summer. Examples are the hammocks of  Florida and the live oak forests of the Gulf and South Atlantic coasts.  Floral dominants include pines, magnolias, bays, hollies, wild tamarine,  strangler fig, gumbo limbo, and palms.</p><p class="depth0">B. Coast shrublands. This is a transitional area between the coastal  grasslands and woodlands and is characterized by woody species with  multiple stems and a few centimeters to several meters above the ground  developing under the influence of salt spray and occasional sand burial.  This includes thickets, scrub, scrub savanna, heathlands, and coastal  chaparral. There is a great variety of shrubland vegetation exhibiting  regional specificity:</p><p class="depth0">1. Northern areas: Characterized by Hudsonia, various erinaceous  species, and thickets of Myricu, prunus, and Rosa.</p><p class="depth0">2. Southeast areas: Floral dominants include Myrica, Baccharis, and  Iles.</p><p class="depth0">3. Western areas: Adenostoma, arcotyphylos, and eucalyptus are the  dominant floral species.</p><p class="depth0">C. Coastal grasslands. This area, which possesses sand dunes and  coastal flats, has low rainfall (10 to 30 inches per year) and large  amounts of humus in the soil. Ecological succession is slow, resulting  in the presence of a number of seral stages of community development.  Dominant vegetation includes mid-grasses (5 to 8 feet tall), such as  Spartina, and trees such as willow (Salix sp.), cherry (Prunus sp.), and  cottonwood (Pupulus deltoides.) This area is divided into four regions  with the following typical strand vegetation:</p><p class="depth0">1. Arctic/Boreal: Elymus;</p><p class="depth0">2. Northeast/West: Ammophla;</p><p class="depth0">3. Southeast Gulf: Uniola; and</p><p class="depth0">4. Mid-Atlantic/Gulf: Spartina patens.</p><p class="depth0">D. Coastal tundra. This ecosystem, which is found along the Arctic  and Boreal coasts of North America, is characterized by low  temperatures, a short growing season, and some permafrost, producing a  low, treeless mat community made up of mosses, lichens, heath, shrubs,  grasses, sedges, rushes, and herbaceous and dwarf woody plants. Common  species include arctic/alpine plants such as Empetrum nigrum and Betula  nana, the lichens Cetraria and Cladonia, and herbaceous plants such as  Potentilla tridentata and Rubus chamaemorus. Common species on the  coastal beach ridges of the high arctic desert include Bryas  intergrifolia and Saxifrage oppositifolia. This area can be divided into  two main subdivisions:</p><p class="depth0">1. Low tundra: Characterized by a thick, spongy mat of living and  undecayed vegetation, often with water and dotted with ponds when not  frozen; and</p><p class="depth0">2. High Tundra: A bare area except for a scanty growth of lichens  and grasses, with underlaying ice wedges forming raised polygonal areas.</p><p class="depth0">E. Coastal cliffs. This ecosystem is an important nesting site for  many sea and shore birds. It consists of communities of herbaceous,  graminoid, or low woody plants (shrubs, heath, etc.) on the top or along  rocky faces exposed to salt spray. There is a diversity of plant species  including mosses, lichens, liverworts, and ``higher'' plant  representatives.</p><p class="depth0">Group II--Transition Areas</p><p class="depth0">A. Coastal marshes. These are wetland areas dominated by grasses  (Poacea), sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae), cattails (Typhaceae),  and other graminoid species and is subject to periodic flooding by  either salt or freshwater. This ecosystem may be subdivided into: (a)  Tidal, which is periodically flooded by either salt or brackish water;  (b) nontidal (freshwater); or (c) tidal freshwater. These are essential  habitats for many important estuarine species of fish and invertebrates  as well as shorebirds and waterfowl and serve important roles in shore  stabilization, flood control, water purification, and nutrient transport  and storage.</p><p class="depth0">B. Coastal swamps. These are wet lowland areas that support mosses  and shrubs together with large trees such as cypress or gum.</p><p class="depth0">C. Coastal mangroves. This ecosystem experiences regular flooding on  either a daily, monthly, or seasonal basis, has low wave action, and is  dominated by a variety of salt-tolerant trees, such as the red mangrove  (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia Nitida), and the white  mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa.) It is also an important habitat for  large populations of fish, invertebrates, and birds. This type of  ecosystem can be found from central Florida to extreme south Texas to  the islands of the Western Pacific.</p><p class="depth0">D. Intertidal beaches. This ecosystem has a distinct biota of  microscopic animals, bacteria, and unicellular algae along with  macroscopic crustaceans, mollusks, and worms with a detritus-based  nutrient cycle. This area also includes the driftline communities found  at high tide levels on the beach. The dominant organisms in this  ecosystem include crustaceans such as the mole crab (Emerita), amphipods  (Gammeridae), ghost crabs (Ocypode), and bivalve mollusks such   as the coquina (Donax) and surf clams (Spisula and Mactra.)</p><p class="depth0">E. Intertidal mud and sand flats. These areas are composed of  unconsolidated, high organic content sediments that function as a short- term storage area for nutrients and organic carbons. Macrophytes are  nearly absent in this ecosystem, although it may be heavily colonized by  benthic diatoms, dinoflaggellates, filamintous blue-green and green  algae, and chaemosynthetic purple sulfur bacteria. This system may  support a considerable population of gastropods, bivalves, and  polychaetes, and may serve as a feeding area for a variety of fish and  wading birds. In sand, the dominant fauna include the wedge shell Donax,  the scallop Pecten, tellin shells Tellina, the heart urchin  Echinocardium, the lug worm Arenicola, sand dollar Dendraster, and the  sea pansy Renilla. In mud, faunal dominants adapted to low oxygen levels  include the terebellid Amphitrite, the boring clam Playdon, the deep sea  scallop Placopecten, the Quahog Mercenaria, the echiurid worm Urechis,  the mud snail Nassarius, and the sea cucumber Thyone.</p><p class="depth0">F. Intertidal algal beds. These are hard substrates along the marine  edge that are dominated by macroscopic algae, usually thalloid, but also  filamentous or unicellular in growth form. This also includes the rocky  coast tidepools that fall within the intertidal zone. Dominant fauna of  these areas are barnacles, mussels, periwinkles, anemones, and chitons.  Three regions are apparent:</p><p class="depth0">1. Northern latitude rocky shores: It is in this region that the  community structure is best developed. The dominant algal species  include Chondrus at the low tide level, Fucus and Ascophylium at the  mid-tidal level, and Laminaria and other kelplike algae just beyond the  intertidal, although they can be exposed at extremely low tides or found  in very deep tidepools.</p><p class="depth0">2. Southern latitudes: The communities in this region are reduced in  comparison to those of the northern latitudes and possesses algae  consisting mostly of single-celled or filamentour green, blue-green, and  red algae, and small thalloid brown algae.</p><p class="depth0">3. Tropical and subtropical latitudes: The intertidal in this region  is very reduced and contains numerous calcareous algae such as  Porolithon and Lithothamnion, as well and green algae with calcareous  particles such as Halimeda, and numerous other green, red, and brown  algae.</p><p class="depth0">Group III--Submerged Bottoms</p><p class="depth0">A. Subtidal hardbottoms. This system is characterized by a  consolidated layer of solid rock or large pieces of rock (neither of  biotic origin) and is found in association with geomorphological  features such as submarine canyons and fjords and is usually covered  with assemblages of sponges, sea fans, bivalves, hard corals, tunicates,  and other attached organisms. A significant feature of estuaries in many  parts of the world is the oyster reef, a type of subtidal hardbottom.  Composed of assemblages of organisms (usually bivalves), it is usually  found near an estuary's mouth in a zone of moderate wave action, salt  content, and turbidity. If light levels are sufficient, a covering of  microscopic and attached macroscopic algae, such as keep, may also be  found.</p><p class="depth0">B. Subtidal softbottoms. Major characteristics of this ecosystem are  an unconsolidated layer of fine particles of silt, sand, clay, and  gravel, high hydrogen sulfide levels, and anaerobic conditions often  existing below the surface. Macrophytes are either sparse or absent,  although a layer of benthic microalgae may be present if light levels  are sufficient. The faunal community is dominated by a diverse  population of deposit feeders including polychaetes, bivalves, and  burrowing crustaceans.</p><p class="depth0">C. Subtidal plants. This system is found in relatively shallow water  (less than 8 to 10 meters) below mean low tide. It is an area of  extremely high primary production that provides food and refuge for a  diversity of faunal groups, especially juvenile and adult fish, and in  some regions, manatees and sea turtles. Along the North Atlantic and  Pacific coasts, the seagrass Zostera marina predominates. In the South  Atlantic and Gulf coast areas, Thalassia and Diplanthera predominate.  The grasses in both areas support a number of epiphytic organisms.</p><p class="depth0">Class II--Physical Characteristics</p><p class="depth0">Group I--Geologic</p><p class="depth0">A. Basin type. Coastal water basins occur in a variety of shapes,  sizes, depths, and appearances. The eight basic types discussed below  will cover most of the cases:</p><p class="depth0">1. Exposed coast: Solid rock formations or heavy sand deposits  characterize exposed ocean shore fronts, which are subject to the full  force of ocean storms. The sand beaches are very resilient, although the  dunes lying just behind the beaches are fragile and easily damaged. The  dunes serve as a sand storage area making them chief stabilizers of the  ocean shorefront.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sheltered coast: Sand or coral barriers, built up by natural  forces, provide sheltered areas inside a bar or reef where the ecosystem  takes on many characteristics of confined waters-abundant marine  grasses, shellfish, and juvenile fish. Water movement is reduced, with  the consequent effects pollution being more severe in this area than in  exposed coastal areas.</p><p class="depth0">3. Bay: Bays are larger confined bodies of water that are open to  the sea and receive strong tidal flow. When stratification is pronounced  the flushing action is augmented by   river discharge. Bays vary in size and in type of shorefront.</p><p class="depth0">4. Embayment: A confined coastal water body with narrow, restricted  inlets and with a significant freshwater inflow can be classified as an  embayment. These areas have more restricted inlets than bays, are  usually smaller and shallower, have low tidal action, and are subject to  sedimentation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Tidal river: The lower reach of a coastal river is referred to as  a tidal river. The coastal water segment extends from the sea or estuary  into which the river discharges to a point as far upstream as there is  significant salt content in the water, forming a salt front. A  combination of tidal action and freshwater outflow makes tidal rivers  well-flushed. The tidal river basin may be a simple channel or a complex  of tributaries, small associated embayments, marshfronts, tidal flats,  and a variety of others.</p><p class="depth0">6. Lagoon: Lagoons are confined coastal bodies of water with  restricted inlets to the sea and without significant freshwater inflow.  Water circulation is limited, resulting in a poorly flushed, relatively  stagnant body of water. Sedimentation is rapid with a great potential  for basin shoaling. Shores are often gently sloping and marshy.</p><p class="depth0">7. Perched coastal wetlands: Unique to Pacific islands, this wetland  type found above sea level in volcanic crater remnants forms as a result  of poor drainage characteristics of the crater rather than from  sedimentation. Floral assemblages exhibit distinct zonation while the  faunal constituents may include freshwater, brackish, and/or marine  species. Example: Aunu's Island, American Samoa.</p><p class="depth0">8. Anchialine systems: These small coastal exposures of brackish  water form in lava depressions or elevated fossil reefs have only a  subsurface connection in the ocean, but show tidal fluctuations.  Differing from true estuaries in having no surface continuity with  streams or ocean, this system is characterized by a distinct biotic  community dominated by benthis algae such as Rhizoclonium, the mineral  encrusting Schiuzothrix, and the vascular plant Ruppia maritima.  Characteristic fauna which exhibit a high degree of endemicity, include  the mollusks Theosoxus neglectus and Tcariosus. Although found  throughout the world, the high islands of the Pacific are the only areas  within the U.S. where this system can be found.</p><p class="depth0">B. Basin structure. Estuary basins may result from the drowning of a  river valley (coastal plains estuary), the drowning of a glacial valley  (fjord), the occurrence of an offshore barrier (bar-bounded estuary),  some tectonic process (tectonic estuary), or volcanic activity (volcanic  estuary).</p><p class="depth0">1. Coastal plains estuary: Where a drowned valley consists mainly of  a single channel, the form of the basin is fairly regular forming a  simple coastal plains estuary. When a channel is flooded with numerous  tributaries an irregular estuary results. Many estuaries of the eastern  United States are of this type.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fjord: Estuaries that form in elongated steep headlands that  alternate with deep U-shaped valleys resulting from glacial scouring are  called fjords. They generally possess rocky floors or very thin veneers  of sediment, with deposition generally being restricted to the head  where the main river enters. Compared to total fjord volume river  discharge is small. But many fjords have restricted tidal ranges at  their mouths due to sills, or upreaching sections of the bottom which  limit free movement of water, often making river flow large with respect  to the tidal prism. The deepest portions are in the upstream reaches,  where maximum depths can range from 800m to 1200m while sill depths  usually range from 40m to 150m.</p><p class="depth0">3. Bar-bounded estuary: These result from the development of an  offshore barrier such as a beach strand, a line of barrier islands, reef  formations a line of moraine debris, or the subsiding remnants of a  deltaic lobe. The basin is often partially exposed at low tide and is  enclosed by a chain of offshore bars of barrier islands broken at  intervals by inlets. These bars may be either deposited offshore or may  be coastal dunes that have become isolated by recent seal level rises.</p><p class="depth0">4. Tectonic estuary: These are coastal indentures that have formed  through tectonic processes such as slippage along a fault line (San  Francisco Bay), folding or movement of the earth's bedrock often with a  large inflow of freshwater.</p><p class="depth0">5. Volcanic estuary: These coastal bodies of open water, a result of  volcanic processes are depressions or craters that have direct and/or  subsurface connections with the ocean and may or may not have surface  continuity with streams. These formations are unique to island areas of  volcanic orgin.</p><p class="depth0">C. Inlet type. Inlets in various forms are an integral part of the  estuarine environment as they regulate to a certain extent, the velocity  and magnitude of tidal exchange, the degree of mixing, and volume of  discharge to the sea.</p><p class="depth0">1. Unrestricted: An estuary with a wide unrestricted inlet typically  has slow currents, no significant turbulence, and receives the full  effect of ocean waves and local disturbances which serve to modify the  shoreline. These estuaries are partially mixed, as the open mouth  permits the incursion of marine waters to considerable distances  upstream, depending on the tidal amplitude and stream gradient.</p><p class="depth0">2. Restricted: Restrictions of estuaries can exist in many forms:  Bars, barrier islands, spits, sills, and more. Restricted inlets result  in decreased circulation, more pronounced longitudinal and vertical  salinity gradients, and more rapid sedimentation. However, if   the estuary mouth is restricted by depositional features or land  closures, the incoming tide may be held back until it suddenly breaks  forth into the basin as a tidal wave, or bore. Such currents exert  profound effects on the nature of the subtrate, turbidity, and biota of  the estuary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Permanent: Permanent inlets are usually opposite the mouths of  major rivers and permit river water to flow into the sea.</p><p class="depth0">4. Temporary (Intermittent): Temporary inlets are formed by storms  and frequently shift position, depending on tidal flow, the depth of the  sea, and sound waters, the frequency of storms, and the amount of  littoral transport.</p><p class="depth0">D. Bottom composition. The bottom composition of estuaries attests  to the vigorous, rapid, and complex sedimentation processes  characteristic of most coastal regions with low relief. Sediments are  derived through the hydrologic processes of erosion, transport, and  deposition carried on by the sea and the stream.</p><p class="depth0">1. Sand: Near estuary mouths, where the predominating forces of the  sea build spits or other depositional features, the shore and substrates  of the estuary are sandy. The bottom sediments in this area are usually  coarse, with a graduation toward finer particles in the head region and  other zones of reduced flow, fine silty sands are deposited. Sand  deposition occurs only in wider or deeper regions where velocity is  reduced.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mud: At the base level of a stream near its mouth, the bottom is  typically composed of loose muds, silts, and organic detritus as a  result of erosion and transport from the upper stream reaches and  organic decomposition. Just inside the estuary entrance, the bottom  contains considerable quantities of sand and mud, which support a rich  fauna. Mud flats, commonly built up in estuarine basins, are composed of  loose, coarse, and fine mud and sand, often dividing the original  channel.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rock: Rocks usually occur in areas where the stream runs rapidly  over a steep gradient with its coarse materials being derived from the  higher elevations where the stream slope is greater. The larger  fragments are usually found in shallow areas near the stream mouth.</p><p class="depth0">4. Oyster shell: Throughout a major portion of the world, the oyster  reef is one of the most significant features of estuaries, usually being  found near the mouth of the estuary in a zone of moderate wave action,  salt content, and turbidity. It is often a major factor in modifying  estuarine current systems and sedimentation, and may occur as an  elongated island or peninsula oriented across the main current, or may  develop parallel to the direction of the current.</p><p class="depth0">Group II--Hydrographic</p><p class="depth0">A. Circulation. Circulation patterns are the result of combined  influences of freshwater inflow, tidal action, wind and oceanic forces,  and serve many functions: Nutrient transport, plankton dispersal,  ecosystem flushing, salinity control, water mixing, and more.</p><p class="depth0">1. Stratified: This is typical of estuaries with a strong freshwater  influx and is commonly found in bays formed from ``drowned'' river  valleys, fjords, and other deep basins. There is a net movement of  freshwater outward at the top layer and saltwater at the bottom layer,  resulting in a net outward transport of surface organisms and net inward  transport of bottom organisms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-stratified: Estuaries of this type are found where water  movement is sluggish and flushing rate is low, although there may be  sufficient circulation to provide the basis for a high carrying  capacity. This is common to shallow embayments and bays lacking a good  supply of freshwater from land drainage.</p><p class="depth0">3. Lagoonal: An estuary of this type is characterized by low rates  of water movement resulting from a lack of significant freshwater influx  and a lack of strong tidal exchange because of the typically narrow  inlet connecting the lagoon to the sea. Circulation whose major driving  force is wind, is the major limiting factor in biological productivity  within lagoons.</p><p class="depth0">B. Tides. This is the most important ecological factor in an estuary  as it affects water exchange and its vertical range determines the  extent of tidal flats which may be exposed and submerged with each tidal  cycle. Tidal action against the volume of river water discharged into an  estuary results in a complex system whose properties vary according to  estuary structure as well as the magnitude of river flow and tidal  range. Tides are usually described in terms of the cycle and their  relative heights. In the United States, tide height is reckoned on the  basis of average low tide, which is referred to as datum. The tides,  although complex, fall into three main categories:</p><p class="depth0">1. Diurnal: This refers to a daily change in water level that can be  observed along the shoreline. There is one high tide and one low tide  per day.</p><p class="depth0">2. Semidiurnal: This refers to a twice daily rise and fall in water  that can be observed along the shoreline.</p><p class="depth0">3. Wind/Storm tides: This refers to fluctuations in water elevation  to wind and storm events, where influence of lunar tides is less.</p><p class="depth0">C. Freshwater. According to nearly all the definitions advanced, it  is inherent that all estuaries need freshwater, which is drained from  the land and measurably dilutes seawater to create a brackish condition.  Freshwater enters an estuary as runoff from the   land either from a surface and/or subsurface source.</p><p class="depth0">1. Surface water: This is water flowing over the ground in the form  of streams. Local variation in runoff is dependent upon the nature of  the soil (porosity and solubility), degree of surface slope,  vegetational type and development, local climatic conditions, and volume  and intensity of precipitation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Subsurface water: This refers to the precipitation that has been  absorbed by the soil and stored below the surface. The distribution of  subsurface water depends on local climate, topography, and the porosity  and permeability of the underlying soils and rocks. There are two main  subtypes of surface water:</p><p class="depth0">a. Vadose water: This is water in the soil above the water table.  Its volume with respect to the soil is subject to considerable  fluctuation.</p><p class="depth0">b. Groundwater: This is water contained in the rocks below the water  table, is usually of more uniform volume than vadose water, and  generally follows the topographic relief of the land being high hills  and sloping into valleys.</p><p class="depth0">Group III--Chemical</p><p class="depth0">A. Salinity. This reflects a complex mixture of salts, the most  abundant being sodium chloride, and is a very critical factor in the  distribution and maintenance of many estuarine organisms. Based on  salinity, there are two basic estuarine types and eight different  salinity zones (expressed in parts per thousand-ppt.)</p><p class="depth0">1. Positive estuary: This is an estuary in which the freshwater  influx is sufficient to maintain mixing, resulting in a pattern of  increasing salinity toward the estuary mouth. It is characterized by low  oxygen concentration in the deeper waters and considerable organic  content in bottom sediments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative estuary: This is found in particularly arid regions,  where estuary evaporation may exceed freshwater inflow, resulting in  increased salinity in the upper part of the basin, especially if the  estuary mouth is restricted so that tidal flow is inhibited. These are  typically very salty (hyperhaline), moderately oxygenated at depth, and  possess bottom sediments that are poor in organic content.</p><p class="depth0">3. Salinity zones (expressed in ppt):</p><p class="depth0">a. Hyperhaline--greater than 40 ppt.</p><p class="depth0">b. Euhaline--40 ppt to 30 ppt.</p><p class="depth0">c. Mixhaline--30 ppt to 0.5 ppt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Mixoeuhaline--greater than 30 ppt but less than the adjacent  euhaline sea.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Polyhaline--30 ppt to 18 ppt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Mesohaline--18 ppt to 5 ppt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Oligohaline--5 ppt to 0.5 ppt.</p><p class="depth2">d. Limnetic: Less than 0.5 ppt.</p><p class="depth2">B. pH Regime: This is indicative of the mineral richness of  estuarine waters and falls into three main categories:</p><p class="depth2">1. Acid: Waters with a pH of less than 5.5.</p><p class="depth2">2. Circumneutral: A condition where the pH ranges from 5.5 to 7.4.</p><p class="depth2">3.
