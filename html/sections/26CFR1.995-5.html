                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Limitation. Under section 995(d), the amount as  of the close of a ``group taxable year'' (as defined in subparagraph (3)  of this paragraph) of foreign investment attributable to producer's  loans of a DISC for purposes of section 995(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(G)</em> shall be the excess  (as of the close of such year) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The smallest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount of the net increase in foreign assets (as defined in  paragraph (b) of this section) by domestic and foreign members of the  controlled group which includes the DISC,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the actual foreign investment by the domestic  members of such group (as determined under paragraph (c) of this  section), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of outstanding producer's loans (as determined under  Sec. 1.993-4) by such DISC to members of such controlled group, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph relates ceases to exist within the  meaning of Sec. 1.995-4(c)(2), then such amount shall no longer be taken  into account by the group for any purpose. For inclusion of amounts  because of certain corporate acquisitions, see paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Controlled group; domestic and foreign member. For purposes of  this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``controlled group'' has the meaning assigned to such  term by Sec. 1.993-1(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term domestic member means a domestic corporation which is  a member of a controlled group, and the term foreign member means a  foreign corporation which is a member of a controlled group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Group taxable year. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term group taxable year refers  collectively to the taxable year of the DISC and to the taxable year of  each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending  with or within the taxable year of the DISC. Thus, for example, if a  corporation has a subsidiary which uses the calendar year as its taxable  year and which elects to be treated as a DISC, and if the parent has a  taxable year ending on October 31, the ``group taxable year'' for 1973  would refer to calendar year 1973 for the DISC and to the parent's  taxable year ending October 31, 1973.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In cases in which the DISC makes a return for a short taxable  year, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12  months, pursuant to section 443 and the regulations thereunder, or  Sec. 1.991-1(b)(3), the following rules shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a change in the annual accounting period of the  DISC resulting in a short taxable year, the group taxable year refers  collectively to the short taxable year and to the taxable year of each  corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with  or within the short taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a DISC which is in existence during only part of  what would otherwise be its taxable year, the group taxable year refers  collectively to the short period during which the DISC was in existence  and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group  which includes the DISC ending with or within the 12-month period ending  on the last day of the short period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to periods prior to the first taxable year for  which a member of the group qualified (or is treated) as a DISC, each  group taxable year shall be determined under subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph as if such member was in existence, it qualified as a DISC,  and its taxable year ended on that date corresponding to the date such  member's first taxable year ended after it qualified (or is treated) as  a DISC whether or not the corporation which qualifies (or is treated) as  a DISC used the same taxable year before it so qualified (or is so  treated). Thus, for example, if a corporation which is organized on  March 3, 1975, uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and is a  member of a controlled group which does not include a DISC, first  qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC for calendar year 1975, then the  term ``group taxable year'' with respect to years prior to 1975 refers  collectively to such prior calendar years and to the taxable year of  each corporation in the group ending with or within such prior calendar  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For special rules in the case of a group which includes more  than one DISC, see paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts determined for prior years. Unless the 3-year limitation  is properly elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the  amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net increase in foreign  assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign investments by domestic  members) of this section reflect, as of the close of a group taxable  year, amounts for all taxable years of members of the group beginning  after December 31, 1971 (and amounts arising after December 31, 1971, or  such other date prescribed in paragraph (b)(7) of this section),  provided that such amounts relate to such group taxable year and  preceding group taxable   years. Thus, for example, if all members of a controlled group use the  calendar year as the taxable year, and 1980 is the first taxable year  for which any member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC,  then, unless the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of  this paragraph, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section will be taken into account beginning with the dates specified in  the preceding sentence. For rules as to carryovers on certain corporate  acquisitions and reorganizations, see paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Three-year elective limitation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A DISC may elect to take  into account only amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net  increase in foreign assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign  investment by domestic members) of this section for the 3 taxable years  of each member immediately preceding its taxable year included in that  first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year  during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. For purposes of the  preceding sentence, determinations shall be made by reference to the  taxable year of the issuer or transferor (as the case may be). If an  election is made under this subdivision, the offset for uncommitted  transitional funds under paragraph (b)(7) of this section is not  allowed. If an election is made under this subdivision, the 3-year  limitation applies to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1)  and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall  not apply with respect to amounts which must be carried over under  paragraph (d) of this section in the case of certain corporate  acquisitions and reorganizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall  be made by the DISC attaching to its first return, filed under section  6011(e)(2), a statement to the effect that the 3-year limitation is  being elected under Sec. 1.995-5(a)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cumulative basis. Pursuant to section 995(d)(5), all  determinations of amounts specified in this section are to be made on a  cumulative basis from the 1st year (or date) provided for in this  section. Thus, each such determination shall take into account a net  increase or a net decrease during the year, as the case may be. However,  if the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this  paragraph, then only amounts with respect to periods specified in such  subparagraph (5) are amounts taken into account for years before a  member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. The  computations described in this section may be made in any way chosen by  the DISC (including a corporation being tested as to whether it  qualifies as a DISC), provided such method results in the amount  prescribed by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable  year, is a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph).

For a 3-year elective limitation with  respect to the first taxable year for which a member qualifies (or is  treated) as a DISC, see paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For manner of  determining amounts on a cumulative basis, see paragraph (a)(6) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Investments made in foreign assets. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, there shall be taken into account as  investment in foreign assets the aggregate of the amounts expended  (within the meaning of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) during the  period described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph by all  members of the controlled group which includes the DISC to acquire  assets described in section 1231(b) (determined without regard to any  holding period therein provided) which are located outside the United  States (as defined in Sec. 1.993-7) reduced by the aggregate of the  amounts received by all such members of the controlled group from the  sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of such assets described in  section 1231(b) which are located outside the United States. For  purposes of this section, amounts expended for assets which are  qualified export assets (as defined in Sec. 1.993-2) of a DISC (or which  would be qualified export assets if owned by a DISC) shall not be taken  into account. Thus, for example, if a DISC acquires a qualified export  asset located outside the United States, the asset is not to be taken  into account for purposes of determining the net increase in foreign  assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As used in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term  amounts expended (or amounts received) means the amount of any money or  the fair market value (on the date of acquisition, sale, exchange, or  involuntary conversion) of any property (other than money) used to  acquire (or received for) the assets described in such subdivision (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> shall be considered located in the United  States and all other aircraft or vessels shall be considered located  outside the United States. Thus, for example, if a member of a  controlled group which includes a DISC acquires a vessel which is  documented under the laws of a foreign country, the amount expended to  acquire that vessel is an amount described in subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its  taxable year, is a domestic member of a controlled group (within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section). During 1972, in a  transaction to which section 1031 applies, X acquires a warehouse  located outside the United States and having a fair market value of  $100. As consideration, X transfers $20 in cash and a warehouse located  within the United States and having a fair market value of $80. Under  these facts, $100 will be taken into account as investment in foreign  assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the  warehouse transferred by X as consideration is located outside the  United States. Under these facts, only $20 will be taken into account as  investment in foreign assets because the amount expended for such assets  (i.e., $100) is reduced   by the fair market value of any property located outside the United  States received in exchange for such assets (i.e., $80).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Depreciation with respect to all foreign assets of a controlled  group. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the depreciation  (determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) or depletion  (determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) attributable  to taxable years of the member beginning after December 31, 1971, with  respect to all of the group's foreign assets described in subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph including such assets acquired prior to the date  provided in such subparagraph (2), and without regard to whether the 3- year election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section is made. Thus, for  example, depreciation for a taxable year of a member beginning after  December 31, 1971, with respect to an asset described in section 1231(b)  which is located outside of the United States and which was acquired  during a taxable year of the member beginning before January 1, 1972, is  an offset allowed by this subparagraph. For a further example,  depreciation with respect to a qualified export asset is not such an  offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The depreciation taken into account under subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of an asset owned by a domestic member, only the  amount allowed under section 167(b)(1) (relating to the allowance of the  straight-line method of depreciation) and Sec. 1.162-11 (b) (relating to  amortization in lieu of depreciation), but not the amount allowed under  section 179 (relating to the additional first-year depreciation  allowance).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an asset owned by a foreign member, the  depreciation and amortization (referred to in (a) of this subdivision)  allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits under  subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The depletion taken into account under subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph shall be limited to cost depletion computed under sections  611 and 612 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, percentage depletion  is not to be taken into account in computing the offset under this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amount of outstanding stock or debt. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offset allowed by  this subparagraph is the outstanding amount of stock (including treasury  stock) or debt obligations of any member of the group issued, sold, or  exchanged after December 31, 1971, by any member (whether or not the  same member) to persons who (on the date of such issuance, sale, or  exchange) were neither United States persons (within the meaning of  section 7701(a)(30)) nor members of the group: Provided, That, in the  case of a debt obligation, such obligation is not repaid within 12  months after such issuance, sale, or exchange. Thus, for example, if  stock is issued to a member of the group before January 1, 1972, and  after December 31, 1971, it is sold to a person who is neither a United  States person nor a member of the group, an offset allowed by this  subparagraph includes the outstanding amount of such stock. For purposes  of this subparagraph, foreign branches of United States banks are not  considered to be United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations shall be  determined in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations described in  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is equal to the net amount  described in (b) of this subdivision reduced (but not below zero) by the  amount described in (c) of this subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> is the excess  of (1) the aggregate of the amount of money and the fair market value of  property (other than money) transferred by persons who are not members  of the group and who are not U.S. persons as consideration for such  stock and debt obligations over (2) fees and commission expenses borne  by the issuer or transferror with respect to their issuance, sale, or  exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> is the aggregate  amount of money and fair market value of property (other than money)  distributed to such persons on distributions in respect of such stock  from other than earnings and profits or on distributions in redemption  of such stock and the   amount of principal paid pursuant to such debt obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this subdivision (ii), in the case of a  redemption, the stock or debt redeemed shall be charged against the  earliest of such stock or debt issued, sold, or exchanged in order to  determine the amount by which the balance of outstanding stock or debt  is to be reduced. For purposes of this subparagraph, the fair market  value of property received as consideration shall be determined as of  the date the transaction occurs, and a contribution to capital within  the meaning of section 118 shall be treated as the issuance of stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph apply  regardless of the treatment under the Code of the transaction in which  the stock or debt was issued, sold, or exchanged. Thus, for example, if  X Corporation, a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC,  acquires from a nonresident alien individual in exchange solely for X's  voting stock all of the stock of Y Corporation pursuant to a  reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(B), the fair market value  of the Y stock on the date of the exchange would be an offset allowed by  this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X Corporation is a member of a controlled group (within a  meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) every member of which uses  the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1972, X issues in a  public offering its stock to persons described in subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph who, in the aggregate, pay $1,000 as consideration. X  pays $100 in underwriting fees. On the same date, X receives $425 upon  issuing a $500 debt obligation to such persons at a discount of $75 and  pays $25 in underwriting fees. On December 31, 1972, the offset allowed  under this subparagraph is $1,300, i.e., ($1,000 minus $100) plus ($425  minus $25). If, during 1973, X makes a distribution of $150 (not in  redemption) from other than earnings and profits with respect to such  stock, then the offset is reduced to $1,150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Earnings and profits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offset allowed by this subparagraph  is one-half the aggregate of the earnings and profits accumulated for  all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, computed (without  regard to any distributions from earnings and profits by a foreign  corporation to a domestic corporation in accordance with Sec. 1.964-1  (relating to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits),  of each foreign member of the group which is controlled directly or  indirectly (as determined under the principles of section 958 and the  regulations thereunder) by a domestic member of the group and each  foreign branch of a domestic member of the group (computed as if the  branch were a foreign corporation). The DISC is bound by any action on  behalf of a foreign member that was taken pursuant to Sec. 1.964-1(c)(3)  or by any failure to take action by or on behalf of a foreign member  within the time specified in Sec. 1.964-1(c)(6). With respect to a  foreign member for which action was not previously required under  Sec. 1.964-1(c)(6) to be taken, the DISC may take action on behalf of  such member by attaching a statement to that effect to the return of the  DISC under section 6011(e)(2) for the first taxable year during which it  qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC and there is outstanding a  producer's loan made by such DISC to a member of the controlled group  which includes the DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the aggregate of the accumulated earnings and profits  described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is a deficit, the  amount allowable as an offset under this subparagraph is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Royalties and fees. An offset allowed by this subparagraph is  one-half the royalties and fees paid by foreign members of the group to  domestic members of the group and by foreign branches of domestic  members of the group to domestic members of the group during the taxable  years of such members beginning after December 31, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Uncommitted transitional funds. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offset allowed by this  subparagraph for the uncommitted transitional funds of the group is the  sum described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph of the amount of  certain capital raised under the foreign direct investment program and  the amounts described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph of  certain foreign excess working capital held on October 31, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount described in this subdivision of certain capital  raised under the foreign direct investment program is the excess (if  any) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(30))</em> nor members of the group,  but only to the extent the taxpayer establishes that such amount  constitutes a long-term borrowing (see 15 CFR 1000.324 \1\) for purposes  of the foreign direct investment program (see 15 CFR part 1000 \1\),  over ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Editorial Note: 15 CFR part 1000 was removed at 39 FR 30481,  Aug. 23, 1974. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount (determined under paragraph (c) of this section) of  actual foreign investment by the domestic members of the group during  the portion of the period such stock or debt obligations have been  outstanding prior to January 1, 1972, such determination to be made by  substituting January 1, 1968, for the December 31, 1971, date specified  in such paragraph (c) and by not taking into account the earnings and  profits described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.  For purposes of this subparagraph, foreign branches of United States  banks are not considered to be United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(a)</em> A taxpayer may establish that an amount under subdivision  (ii) (a) of this subparagraph constitutes a long-term borrowing for  purposes of the foreign direct investment program by keeping records  sufficient to demonstrate that appropriate reports were filed with the  Office of Foreign Direct Investment of the Department of Commerce with  respect to the foreign borrowing or by any other method satisfactory to  the district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amounts described in subdivision (ii) (a) of this  subparagraph include amounts with respect to which an election under  section 4912(c), to subject certain obligations of a United States  person to the interest equalization tax, has been made: Provided, That  the obligations to which such amounts relate were issued by an  ``overseas financing subsidiary'' described in 15 CFR part 1000 \1\ and  were assumed by a United States person from such overseas financing  subsidiary. Thus, for example, if an overseas financing subsidiary  issues its notes to a foreign person in 1968, and such notes are assumed  by its United States parent in 1973, which parent elects under section  4912(c) to have the notes subject to the interest equalization tax, then  the amount of money received by the subsidiary is an amount described in  subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount described in this subdivision of foreign excess  working capital is the amount of liquid assets held by the foreign  members of such group and foreign branches of domestic members of such  group on October 31, 1971 (whether or not so held after such date) in  excess of their reasonable working capital needs (as defined in  Sec. 1.993-2 (e)) on that date, but only to the extent not included in  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subdivision,  the term liquid assets means money, bank deposits (not including time  deposits), and indebtedness of any kind (including time deposits) which  on the day acquired had a maturity of 2 years or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Example.

The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M Corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year.  On November 18, 1973, M acquires from A, an individual United States  person, for $1 million cash all 10,000 shares of the voting stock of N,  a foreign corporation. N's only asset is a warehouse located in France  with a fair market value on the date of acquisition of $1 million. Under  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the controlled group of which M is a  member is considered to have expended $1 million for the acquisition of  foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that on  November 18, 1973, M acquires only 80 percent of N's voting stock. M is  considered to have expended $800,000 for the acquisition of assets  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, computed as follows:  (1) Fair market value of N's foreign assets described in      $1,000,000</p><p class="depth0">paragraph (b)(2) of this section..........................

The facts are the same as in example 2, except that  individual A is not a United States person, and M acquires the 80  percent of N voting stock in exchange for cash of $100,000 and M stock  having a fair market value on the date of the acquisition of $700,000. M  is considered to have acquired assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section in the amount of $800,000 (see computations in example 2)  and to have an offset under paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating  to outstanding stock or debt) of $700,000 (the fair market value of the  M stock transferred to A who is not a United States person). However,  the controlled group of which   M is a member is not considered to have acquired any other amounts  described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section with respect to  N for taxable years prior to the taxable year of N during which the  acquisition occurred.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. P Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its  taxable year, is a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC.  During 1973, P acquires from B, an individual United States person, for  cash, 30 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of  stock entitled to vote of Q, a foreign corporation. All of Q's assets  are assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No additional  interest in Q is acquired by members of the group during 1973. The  controlled group of which Q is a member is not considered to have made  any investments in foreign assets described in such paragraph (b)(2) as  of the close of 1973.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example 4. Assume further  that during 1974, R Corporation, a member of the controlled group which  includes P, acquires for cash 40 percent of the total combined voting  power of all classes of stock of Q entitled to vote as follows: 20  percent on July 31, and 20 percent on December 31. Thus, on December 31,  1974, members of the controlled group own 70 percent of Q's voting power  (30+20+20) and on that date are considered to have acquired a majority  interest in Q. The fair market value of Q's assets on December 31, 1974,  is $5 million. The group is considered to have expended $3,500,000 for  the acquisition of assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section  computed as follows:  (1) Fair market value of Q's foreign assets described in      $5,000,000</p><p class="depth0">paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of the date the</p><p class="depth0">acquisition is deemed to have occurred under subparagraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this paragraph (December 31, 1974).................

The group  is considered to have expended $5,150,000 for the acquisition of assets  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of the close of 1975,  computed as follows:  (1) Amount of prior years' investment......................   $3,500,000</p><p class="depth0">============ (2) Investment during 1975:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fair market value of Q's foreign assets described in    $5,500,000</p><p class="depth0">paragraph (b)(2) of this section on July 15, 1975.......</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiply by additional percentage acquired of total             .3</p><p class="depth0">combined voting power of all classes of Q stock entitled</p><p class="depth0">to vote.................................................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Investment during 1975...............................   $1,650,000</p><p class="depth0">============ (3) Amount considered expended for foreign assets described   $5,150,000</p><p class="depth0">in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by reason of the</p><p class="depth0">acquisition of Q stock....................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Records.

In the case of a  controlled group which includes more than one DISC, the amounts  described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be allocated  among the DISC's in order to determine the limitation in paragraph (a)  of this section. Each DISC's allocable portion of these amounts shall be  equal to the total of such amounts multiplied by a fraction the  numerator of which is the individual DISC's outstanding producer's loans  to members of the group, and the denominator of which is the aggregate  amounts of outstanding producer's loans to members of the group by all  DISC's which are members of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, a statement indicating which such taxable year will  be used. Once such an election is made it may not be revoked until such  time as all of the DISC's which are members of the group use the same  taxable year. If this   subparagraph applies, books and records must be kept by the group which  are adequate to show the necessary computations under section 995(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation X and corporation Y are members of the same  controlled group and each has elected to be treated as a DISC. X uses a  taxable year ending March 31, and Y uses a taxable year ending November  30. Notwithstanding the fact that all other members of the group use the  calendar year as their taxable year, all computations for purposes of  determining the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's  loans under section 995(d) must be made as if both DISC's use a taxable  year ending either March 31 (X's taxable year) or November 30 (Y's  taxable year).
