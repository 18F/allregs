If NMFS projects that catch will reach 92 percent of the annual sub-ACL  allocated to a management area before the end of the fishing year, or 92  percent of the Area 1A or Area 1B sub-ACL allocated to a seasonal period  as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, NMFS shall prohibit  vessels, beginning the date the catch is projected to reach 92 percent  of the sub-ACL, from fishing for, possessing, catching, transferring, or  landing more than 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of Atlantic herring per trip in  the applicable area, and from landing herring more than once per  calendar day, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.

If NMFS projects that catch will reach  95 percent of the ACL before the end of the fishing year, NMFS shall  prohibit vessels, beginning the date the catch is projected to reach 95  percent of the ACL, from fishing for, possessing, catching,  transferring, or landing more than 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of Atlantic  herring per trip in all herring management areas, and from landing  herring more than once per calendar day, except as provided in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

Upon this determination, the haddock  possession limit is reduced to 0 lb (0 kg) in the applicable AM area for  a vessel issued a Federal Atlantic herring permit and fishing with  midwater trawl gear or for a vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access  Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit  fishing on a declared   herring trip, regardless of area fished or gear used, in the applicable  AM area, unless the vessel also possesses a Northeast multispecies  permit and is operating on a declared (consistent with Sec. 648.10(g))  Northeast multispecies trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ACL overage deduction. If NMFS determines that total catch  exceeded any ACL or sub-ACL for a fishing year, then the amount of the  overage shall be subtracted from that ACL or sub-ACL for the fishing  year following total catch determination.
