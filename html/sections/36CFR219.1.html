                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart sets out the planning requirements for developing,  amending, and revising land management plans (also referred to as plans)  for units of the National Forest System (NFS), as required by the Forest  and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by  the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.)  (NFMA). This subpart also sets out the requirements for plan components  and other content in land management plans. This part is applicable to  all units of the NFS as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609 or subsequent statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (16  U.S.C. 528-531) (MUSYA), the Forest Service manages the NFS to sustain  the multiple use of its renewable resources in perpetuity while  maintaining the long-term health and productivity of the land. Resources  are managed through a combination of approaches and concepts for the  benefit of human communities and natural resources. Land management  plans guide sustainable, integrated resource management of the resources  within the plan area in the context of the broader landscape, giving due  consideration to the relative values of the various resources in  particular areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The purpose of this part is to guide the collaborative and  science-based development, amendment, and revision of land management  plans that promote the ecological integrity of national forests and  grasslands and other administrative units of the NFS. Plans will guide  management of NFS lands so that they are ecologically sustainable and  contribute to social and economic sustainability; consist of ecosystems  and watersheds with ecological integrity and diverse plant and animal  communities; and have the capacity to provide people and communities  with ecosystem services and multiple uses that provide a range of  social, economic, and ecological benefits for the present and into the  future. These benefits include clean air and water; habitat for fish,  wildlife, and plant communities; and opportunities for recreational,  spiritual, educational, and cultural benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This part does not affect treaty rights or valid existing rights  established by statute or legal instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During the planning process, the responsible official shall  comply with Section 8106 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of  2008 (25 U.S.C. 3056), Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996, Executive  Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, laws, and other requirements with  respect to disclosing or withholding under the Freedom of Information  Act (5 U.S.C. 552) certain information regarding reburial sites or other  information that is culturally sensitive to an Indian Tribe or Tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Plans must comply with all applicable laws and regulations,  including NFMA, MUSYA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the  Wilderness Act, and the Endangered Species Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The responsible official shall ensure that the planning process,  plan components, and other plan content are within Forest Service  authority, the inherent capability of the plan area, and the fiscal  capability of the unit.</p>
