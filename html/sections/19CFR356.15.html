In determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under Secretary will consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case. The Deputy Under Secretary will decide whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a report of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Department receives a request to charge from an authorized agency of a FTA country, the Deputy Under Secretary will promptly initiate proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter as set forth in Sec.  356.16.</p>
