Once effective, the Reduction Agreement shall continue in full force and  effect regardless of whether subsequent withdrawals reduce the number of  Subsector Members below that level required to effectuate the Reduction  Agreement. Attempted withdrawal by a Current Offeror or Selected Offeror  shall be invalid, and such Offer shall remain a binding, irrevocable  Offer, unaffected by the attempted withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview.

An Offer that is submitted by a Subsector Member, but is not a  Selected Offer during the subsequent Ranking Period, shall be deemed to  be terminated and the Subsector Member shall have no further obligation  with respect to performance of that Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offer content. All Offers submitted to the Auditor shall  include the following information: LLP License number; LLP License  number(s) of any linked crab LLP Licenses; license MLOA (MLOA--maximum  length overall of a vessel is defined at Sec. 679.2 of this chapter);  the license area, gear and species endorsements; a summary of the  Pacific cod catch history for the calendar years 1995-2004; and the  offered price. The Offer shall also state whether a vessel is currently  designated on the LLP License and as such will be withdrawn from all  fisheries if the Offer is selected for reduction in the Reduction Plan.  If so, the Offer shall identify such vessel by name, official number,  and current owner. In addition, the Offer shall provide a summary of the  Pacific cod catch history for the calendar years 1995-2004 of the vessel  to be retired from the fisheries. All summary catch histories included  in Offers shall be calculated utilizing both the weekly production  report and best blend methodology and shall separately state for each  methodology the Pacific cod catch in metric tons and as a percentage of  the overall catch for   the longline catcher processor subsector on an annual basis for each of  the required years. If the vessel stated to be withdrawn from the  fisheries is not owned by the LLP License owner of record, the Offer  shall be countersigned by the owner of record of the vessel. An Offer  offering a Latent License shall state on the Offer Form that the offered  LLP License is a Latent License.

All details of a Prequalification  Offer shall be kept confidential by the Auditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submitting an offer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offer submission. Commencing on the  first Tuesday following the Opening Date and during all Submission  Periods until the Selection Process is closed, any Subsector Member may  submit an Offer. All Offers are to be on the applicable form provided on  the FLCC website, executed by an Authorized Party and submitted to the  Auditor by facsimile. Any Subsector Member may submit an Offer during  any Submission Period, even if that Subsector Member has not submitted  an Offer in any previous Submission Period. If a Subsector Member holds  more than one LLP License, such Subsector Member may, but is not  required to, submit an Offer for each LLP License held during a  Submission Period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submission periods. The initial Submission Period shall  commence at 9 a.m. (Pacific time) on the Tuesday following the Opening  Date and end at 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week.  Subsequent Submission Periods shall commence at 9 a.m. (Pacific time) on  the first Tuesday following the preceding Ranking Period and end at 5  p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week. All times set forth in  the Reduction Agreement and used in the Offer process shall be the time  kept in the Pacific time zone as calculated by the National Institute of  Standards and Technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Validity of offer. The Auditor shall examine each Offer for  consistency with the Database and information contained in the  enrollment documents. If there is an inconsistency in the information  contained in the Offer, any of the elements required of an Offer  pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section are missing, or the  Auditor does not receive the original Offer Form before the Offers are  to be posted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the Auditor  shall notify the offering Subsector Member by e-mail or mail that the  Offer is nonconforming as soon as practicable after discovering the  basis of invalidity. The Subsector Member may submit a revised,  conforming Offer prior to the close of that Submission Period or, in any  subsequent Submission Period. Only one Offer may be submitted with  respect to an LLP License during a Submission Period. In the event a  Subsector Member submits more than one Offer with respect to an LLP  License during a Submission Period, the first conforming Offer received  by the Auditor shall be binding and irrevocable and any subsequent  Offers shall be deemed invalid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Warranty. By submitting an Offer, the Offering Subsector  Member, warrants and represents that the Offering Subsector Member has  read and understands the terms of the Reduction Agreement, the Offer,  and the Reduction Contract and has had the opportunity to seek  independent legal counsel regarding such documents and/or agreements and  the consequences of submitting an Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Posting offers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Current offers. For each Offer received  during a Submission Period, the Auditor shall post on the Website no  later than 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the following Tuesday all of the  details of such Offer as set forth on the Offer Form. In addition, the  Auditor shall post, as available to Auditor, a summary by year of up to  ten (10) years catch history during the period 1995-2004 in total round  weight equivalents and percentage of Longline   Subsector ITAC harvested for any vessel that is included in the Offer.  Subsector Member (or vessel owner, if other than the Subsector Member)  expressly authorizes Auditor to release the catch history summary  information previously prepared for that Subsector Member or vessel  owner by the Auditor as part of the analysis of FLCC's membership's  catch history previously conducted by the Auditor on behalf of the FLCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Posting order. Offers shall be posted on the Website by the  Auditor in alphabetical order of the Offering Subsector Member's name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Questions as to offer. The Auditor shall respond to no  questions from Subsector Member regarding Offers except to confirm that  the posting accurately reflects the details of the Offer. If an Offering  Subsector Member notices an error in an Offer posting on the Website,  such Subsector Member shall notify the Auditor as soon as practicable.  The Auditor shall review such notice, the posting and the original  Offer. If an error was made in posting the Auditor shall correct the  posting as soon as practicable and notify the Subsector Members via e- mail or mail of the correction. In the event such an error is not  discovered prior to Ranking, an Offering Subsector Member shall be bound  to the terms of the submitted Offer, not the terms of the posted Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Archive. The Auditor shall maintain on the Website an archive  of prior Offers posted, which shall be available for review by all  Subsector Members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ranking--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eligibility. Each Subsector Member that has not  submitted an Offer during the preceding Submission Period, or whose  vessel is not included as a withdrawing vessel in an Offer during the  preceding Submission Period (i.e., a Nonoffering Subsector Member), may  submit to the Auditor a Ranking Form during a Ranking Period. With  respect to Ranking, a Subsector Member that holds more than one LLP  License may participate in the Ranking process for each LLP License not  included in an Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ranking period. The initial Ranking Period shall commence  immediately after the Offers from the preceding Submission Period have  been posted and end at 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week.  Subsequent Ranking Periods shall commence immediately after the Offers  from the preceding Submission Period have been posted and end at 5 p.m.  (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ranking form. Prior to each Ranking Period, the Auditor will  post a Ranking Form on the Website in ``pdf'' file format. Each eligible  Subsector Member wishing to rank the current Offers shall rank the  Offers on the Ranking Form numerically in the Subsector Member's  preferred order of purchase. The Offer that Subsector Member would most  like to have accepted should be ranked number one (1), and subsequent  Offers ranked sequentially until the Offer that the Subsector Member  would least like to see accepted is ranked with the highest numerical  score. A Subsector Member wishing to call for a Closing Vote shall, in  lieu of ranking the Current Offers, mark the Ranking Form to accept the  Selected Offers selected during the prior Ranking Period and close the  Selection Process. To be valid, the Ranking Form must rank each Current  Offer listed on the Ranking Form or, if applicable, be marked to call  for a Closing Vote. Ranking Forms shall be submitted by sending a  completed Ranking Form, signed by an Authorized Party, to the Auditor by  facsimile or mail prior to the end of the Ranking Period. A Subsector  Member is not required to rank the Offers during a Ranking Period or  call for a Closing Vote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Validity of subsector member ranking. The Auditor shall examine  each Ranking Form for completeness, whether the form either ranks the  Offers or calls for a Closing Vote (but not both), and authorized  signature. Any incomplete or otherwise noncompliant Ranking Form(s)  shall be invalid, and shall not be included in the Rankings of the  Current Offers. The Auditor shall notify the Subsector Member of the  reason for declaring any Ranking Form invalid as soon as practicable. A  Subsector Member may cure the submission of an invalid Ranking Form by  submitting a complying Ranking Form if accomplished before the end of  the applicable Ranking Period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Ranking results--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compiling the rankings. Unless two-thirds  (\2/3\) of the Nonoffering Subsector Members have called for a Closing  Vote, the Auditor shall compile the results of the Ranking Forms by  assigning one point for each position on a Ranking Form. That is, the  Offer ranked number one (1) on a Ranking Form shall be awarded one (1)  point, the Offer ranked two (2) shall receive two (2) points, and  continuing on in this manner until all Offers have been assigned points  correlating to its ranking on each valid Ranking Form. The Offer with  the least number of total points assigned shall be the highest ranked  Offer, and the Offer with the greatest total points assigned shall be  the lowest ranked Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Posting rankings. The Auditor shall post the results of the  compilation of the Ranking Forms on the Website in alphabetical order  based on the Offering Subsector Member's name no later than 5 p.m.  (Pacific time) on the Monday following the Ranking Period. The Auditor  shall post the highest consecutive ranking Offers that total thirty six  million dollars ($36,000,000) or less. Those Offering Subsector Members  whose Offers are posted shall be deemed Selected Offerors and their  Offers shall be deemed Selected Offers. Those Offering Subsector Members  whose Offers are not posted shall be deemed Rejected Offerors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Selected offer information or confidentiality. The Auditor  shall post the name of the Offering Subsector Member, the amount of the  Offer, and a summary of the total number of Ranking Forms received and  the number of such forms on which the Members called for a Closing Vote.  Other than the foregoing, the Auditor shall not post any details of the  compilation of the Ranking Forms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Selected offerors. Selected Offerors may not withdraw their  Offers unless in subsequent rankings their Offers no longer are within  the highest ranking Offers and they become Rejected Offerors. A Selected  Offeror may, however, modify a Selected Offer solely to the extent such  modification consists of a reduction in the Offer price. A Selected  Offeror may submit a modified Offer to the Auditor during the next  Offering Period as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Unless  a Selected Offeror becomes a Rejected Offeror in a subsequent Ranking, a  Selected Offeror shall be bound by the terms of the lowest Selected  Offer submitted as if such modified Offer had been the original Selected  Offer. In the event a Selected Offeror submits a modified Offer and such  Offer is not ranked because sufficient votes are received to call for a  Closing Vote, the previously Selected Offer shall remain the Selected  Offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Rejected offerors. The Offer of a Rejected Offeror is terminated  and the Rejected Offeror is no longer bound by the terms of its Offer. A  Rejected Offeror may, at its sole discretion, resubmit the same Offer,  submit a revised Offer, or elect not to submit an Offer during any  subsequent Submission Period until the Selection Process is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ties. In the event there is a tie with respect to Offers which  results in the tied Offers exceeding thirty-six million dollars  ($36,000,000), the tied Offers and all Offers ranked lower than the tied  Offers shall be deemed to be rejected and the Rejected Offerors may, at  their option, submit an Offer in a subsequent Submission Period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Archive. Auditor shall maintain on the Website an archive of  prior Offer Rankings as posted over the course of the Selection Process,  which shall be available for Subsector Member review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Closing.

A Closing Vote will be held when: at least two- thirds (\2/3\) of the Nonoffering Subsector Members submit Ranking Forms  electing to accept the Selected Offerors and close the Selection Process  in lieu of Ranking the current Offers; and there are no unresolved  Protests or Arbitrations. The Auditor shall notify all Subsector Members  by e-mail or mail and posting a notice on the Website as soon as  practicable that a Closing Vote is to be held. Such notice shall state  the starting and ending dates and times of the   voting period, which shall be not less than three (3) nor more than  seven (7) calendar days from the date of such notice. A voting period  shall commence at 9 a.m. (Pacific time) on Monday and end at 5 p.m. on  the Friday of that week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Voting. No less than three (3) calendar days prior to the  voting period, the Auditor will post a Closing Ballot on the Website in  ``pdf'' file format. Each eligible Nonoffering Subsector Member wishing  to vote shall print out the Closing Ballot, and, with respect to each of  the currently Selected Offers on the Closing Ballot, vote either in  favor of or opposed to accepting that Selected Offer and submit a  completed and signed Closing Ballot to the Auditor preferably by  facsimile prior to the end of the Voting Period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ballot verification. The Auditor shall examine each submitted  Closing Ballot for completeness and authorized signature. Any incomplete  Closing Ballot shall be void, and shall not be included in the voting  results. The Auditor shall not notify the Subsector Member of an invalid  Closing Ballot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Voting results. The Auditor shall post the results of the Vote  as soon as practicable after voting closes. Each Offer on the Closing  Ballot that receives votes approving acceptance of such Offer from two- thirds (\2/3\) or more of the total number of Nonoffering Subsector  Members shall be a Selected Offeror and shall be the basis for the  Reduction Plan submitted to NMFS. Any Offer on the Closing Ballot that  does not receive such two-thirds (\2/3\) approval shall be rejected and  shall not be included among the Offers included among the Reduction Plan  submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notification to NMFS. Upon closing of the Selection Process,  FLCC shall notify NMFS in writing of the identities of the Selected  Offerors and provide to NMFS a completed and fully executed original  Reduction Agreement from each of the Selected Offerors and a certified  copy of the fully executed Reduction Agreement and Reduction Contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Capacity reduction. The Reduction Plan shall identify as the  proposed capacity reduction, without auction process, the LLP Licenses  as well as the vessels and the catch histories related to the LLP  Licenses, linked crab LLP Licenses, and any other fishing rights or  other interests associated with the LLP Licenses and vessels included in  the Selected Offers. The aggregate of all Reduction Agreements and  Reduction Contracts signed by Subsector Members whose offers to  participate in this buyback were accepted by votes of the Subsector  Members, will together with the FLCC's supporting documents and  rationale for recognizing that these offers represent the expenditure of  the least money for the greatest capacity reduction, constitute the  Reduction Plan to be submitted to NMFS for approval on behalf of the  Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Loan repayment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Term. As authorized by Section 219(B)(2) of  the Act, the capacity reduction loan (the ``Reduction Loan'') shall be  amortized over a thirty (30) year term. The Reduction Loan's original  principal amount may not exceed thirty-six million dollars  ($36,000,000), but may be less if the reduction cost is less. Subsector  Members acknowledge that in the event payments made under the Reduction  Plan are insufficient to repay the actual loan, the term of repayment  shall be extended by NMFS until the loan is paid in full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest. The Reduction Loan's interest rate will be the U.S.  Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds plus 2 percent.  NMFS will determine the Reduction Loan's initial interest rate when NMFS  borrows from the U.S. Treasury the funds with which to disburse  reduction payments. The initial interest rate will change to a final  interest rate at the end of the Federal fiscal year in which NMFS  borrows the funds from the U.S. Treasury. The final interest rate will  be 2 percent plus a weighted average, throughout that fiscal year, of  the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds. The  final interest rate will be   fixed, and will not vary over the remainder of the reduction loan's 30- year term. The Reduction loan will be subject to a level debt  amortization. There is no prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fees. The Reduction Loan shall be repaid by fees collected  from the Longline Subsector. The fee amount will be based upon: The  principal and interest due over the next twelve months divided by the  product of the Hook & Line, Catcher Processor (Longline Subsector;  sometimes referred to as the ``H&LCP; Subsector'') portion of the BSAI  Pacific cod ITAC (in metric tons) set by the North Pacific Fishery  Management Council (NPFMC) in December of each year multiplied by 2,205  (i.e., the number of pounds in a metric ton). In the event that the  Longline Subsector portion for the ensuing year is not available, the  Longline Subsector portion forecast from the preceding year will be used  to calculate the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fee will be expressed in cents per pound rounded up to the  next one-tenth of a cent. For example: If the principal and interest due  equal $2,900,000 and the Longline Subsector portion equals 100,000  metric tons, then the fee per round weight pound of Pacific cod will  equal 1.4 cents per pound. [2,900,000 /(100,000 x 2,205) = .01315]. The  fee will be accessed and collected on Pacific cod to the extent possible  and if not, will be accessed and collected as provided for in this  paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fees must be accessed and collected on Pacific cod used for bait  or discarded. Although the fee could be up to 5 percent of the ex-vessel  production value of all post-reduction Longline Subsector landings, the  fee will be less than 5 percent if NMFS projects that a lesser rate can  amortize the fishery's reduction loan over the reduction loan's 30-year  term. In the event that the total principal and interest due exceeds 5  percent of the ex-vessel Pacific cod revenues, a penny per pound round  weight fee will be calculated based on the latest available revenue  records and NMFS conversion factors for pollock, arrowtooth flounder,  Greenland turbot, skate, yellowfin sole and rock sole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The additional fee will be limited to the amount necessary to  amortize the remaining twelve months principal and interest in addition  to the 5 percent fee accessed against Pacific cod. The additional fee  will be a minimum of one cent per pound. In the event that collections  exceed the total principal and interest needed to amortize the payment  due, the principal balance of the loan will be reduced. To verify that  the fees collected do not exceed 5 percent of the fishery revenues, the  annual total of principal and interest due will be compared to the  latest available annual Longline Subsector revenues to ensure it is  equal to or less than 5 percent of the total ex-vessel production  revenues. In the event that any of the components necessary to calculate  the next year's fee are not available, or for any other reason NMFS  believes the calculation must be postponed, the fee will remain at the  previous year's amount until such a time that new calculations are made  and communicated to the post reduction fishery participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> It is possible that the fishery may not open during some years  and no Longline Subsector portion of the ITAC is granted. Consequently,  the fishery will not produce fee revenue with which to service the  reduction loan during those years. However, interest will continue to  accrue on the principal balance. When this happens, if the fee rate is  not already at the maximum 5 percent, NMFS will increase the fisheries'  fee rate to the maximum 5 percent of the revenues for Pacific cod and  the species mentioned in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B), apply all subsequent  fee revenue first to the payment of accrued interest, and continue the  maximum fee rates until all principal and interest payments become  current. Once all principal and interest payments are current, NMFS will  make a determination about adjusting the fee rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reduction loan. NMFS has promulgated framework regulations  generally applicable to all fishing capacity reduction programs  (Sec. 600.1000 et seq.). The reduction loan shall be subject to the  provisions of Sec. 600.1012, except that: the borrower's obligation to  repay the reduction loan shall be discharged by the owner of the  Longline Subsector license regardless of which vessel   catches fish under this license and regardless of who processes the fish  in the reduction fishery in accordance with Sec. 600.1013. Longline  Subsector license owners in the reduction fishery shall be obligated to  collect the fee in accordance with Sec. 600.1013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Collection. The LLP License holder of the vessel harvesting in  the post-capacity reduction plan Longline Subsector shall be responsible  for self-collecting the repayment fees owed by that LLP License holder.  Fees shall be submitted to NMFS monthly and shall be due no later than  fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Record keeping and Reporting. The holder of the LLP License on  which a vessel harvesting in the post-capacity reduction plan Longline  Subsector is designated shall be responsible for compliance with the  applicable record keeping and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agreement with Secretary. Each Selected Offeror, and vessel  owner if not the Subsector Member, that has submitted a Selected Offer  shall complete and deliver to the FLCC for inclusion in the Reduction  Plan submitted to NMFS, designee for the Secretary, a completed and  fully executed Reduction Contract. Any and all LLP License(s) and or  vessels set forth on a Selected Offer shall be included as Reduction  Fishing Interests in such Reduction Contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Decisions of the Auditor and the FLCC. Time is of the essence in  developing and implementing a Reduction Plan and, accordingly, the  Offerors shall be limited to, and bound by, the decisions of the Auditor  and the FLCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Auditor's examination of submitted applications, Offers,  Prequalification Offers and Rankings shall be solely ministerial in  nature. That is, the Auditor will verify whether the documents submitted  by Subsector Members are, on their face, consistent with each other and  the Database, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the  Reduction Agreement, and, signed by an Authorized Party. The Auditor may  presume the validity of all signatures on documents submitted. The  Auditor shall not make substantive decisions as to compliance (e.g.,  whether an interim LLP License satisfies the requirements of the Act, or  whether a discrepancy in the name appearing on LLP Licenses and other  documents is material).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Enforcement/specific performance. The parties to the Reduction  Agreement have agreed that the opportunity to develop and submit a  capacity reduction program for the Longline Subsector under the terms of  the Act is both unique and finite and that failure of a Selected  Offeror, and vessel owner, if not a Subsector Member, to perform the  obligations provided by the Reduction Agreement will result in  irreparable damage to the FLCC, the Subsector Members and other Selected  Offerors. Accordingly, the parties to the Reduction Agreement expressly  acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate means of redress and  agree that upon the failure of the Selected Offeror, and vessel owner if  not a Subsector Member, to fulfill its obligations under the Reduction  Agreement that specific performance of those obligations may be obtained  by suit in equity brought by the FLCC in any court of competent  jurisdiction without obligation to arbitrate such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Miscellaneous--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time/Holidays. All times related to the  Selection Process shall be the time kept in the Pacific time zone as  calculated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In the  event that any date occurring within the Selection Process is a Federal  holiday, the date shall roll over to the next occurring business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination. The Reduction Agreement shall automatically  terminate if no vote of acceptance is completed by December 31, 2007.  The Reduction Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to approval  of the Reduction Plan by NMFS, on behalf of the Secretary, by written  notice from 50 percent of Subsector Members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Choice of law/venue. The Reduction Agreement shall be construed  and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington  without regard to its choice of law provisions. The parties submit to  the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court  located in Seattle, Washington, with respect to any   litigation arising out of or relating to the Reduction Agreement or out  of the performance of services hereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Incorporation. All executed counterparts of the Reduction  Agreement, Application Forms and Offers constitute the agreement between  the parties with respect to the subject matter of the Reduction  Agreement and are incorporated into the Reduction Agreement as if fully  written.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Counterparts. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in  multiple counterparts and will be effective as to signatories on the  Effective Date. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in duplicate  originals, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument.  All such counterparts and duplicate originals together shall constitute  the same agreement, whether or not all parties execute each counterpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facsimile signature of any party to the Reduction Agreement  shall constitute the duly authorized, irrevocable execution and delivery  of the Reduction Agreement as fully as if the Reduction Agreement  contained the original ink signatures of the party or parties supplying  a facsimile signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amendment. Subsector Member acknowledges that the Reduction  Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Reduction Plan may be subject  to amendment to conform to the requirements for approval of the  Reduction Plan by NMFS on behalf of the Secretary. The Auditor shall  distribute to each Subsector Member in electronic format the amended  form of the Reduction Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the  Reduction Plan, which amended documents in the form distributed by the  Auditor and identified by the Auditor by date and version, the version  of each such document then in effect at the time of any dispute arising  or action taken shall be deemed binding upon the parties with respect to  such dispute and/or action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Warranties. Subsector Member must expressly warrant and  represent in the Reduction Agreement that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subsector Member has had an opportunity to consult with  Subsector Member's attorney or other advisors of Subsector Member with  respect to the Reduction Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Act  and the ramifications of the ratification of the Reduction Plan  contemplated therein;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsector Member has full understanding and appreciation of the  ramifications of executing and delivering the Reduction Agreement and,  free from coercion of any kind by the FLCC or any of its members,  officers, agents and/or employees, executes and delivers the Reduction  Agreement as the free and voluntary act of Subsector Member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The execution and delivery of the Reduction Agreement, does not  and will not conflict with any provisions of the governing documents of  Subsector Member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The person executing the Reduction Agreement has been duly  authorized by Subsector Member to execute and deliver the Reduction  Agreement and to undertake and perform the actions contemplated herein;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subsector Member has taken all actions necessary for the  Reduction Agreement to constitute the valid and binding obligation of  Subsector Member, enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Approval of the reduction plan. Acceptance of the Offers are at  the sole discretion of NMFS on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

Groundfish Reduction Permit. Offeror expressly acknowledges that  it hereby offers to permanently surrender, relinquish, and have NMFS  permanently revoke the valid non-interim Federal License Limitation  Program groundfish license issued pursuant to 50 CFR 679.4(k) (or  successor regulation) endorsed for Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands  catcher processor fishing activity, C/P, Pacific cod, and hook and line  gear identified in section 46 of this contract as well as any present or  future claims of eligibility for any fishery privilege based upon such  permit, including any Latent License and any offered and accepted  interim permit that Offeror causes to become a non-interim permit, (the  ``Groundfish Reduction Permit'').</p><p class="depth0">5.

Offeror agrees to instruct the United States Coast Guard's Vessel  Documentation Center to remove the fishery endorsement from the  Reduction Privilege Vessel. If the Reduction Privilege Vessel is not a  federally documented vessel, the Offeror offers to promptly scrap the  vessel and allow NMFS whatever access to the scrapping NMFS deems  reasonably necessary to document and confirm the scrapping.</p><p class="depth0">8. Reduction Fishing History. Offeror surrenders, relinquishes, and  consents to NMFS' permanent revocation of the following Reduction  Fishing History (the ``Reduction Fishing History''):</p><p class="depth0">a.

The Offeror shall also  include with the offer all other information required in this Reduction  Contract and otherwise comply with Reduction Contract requirements.</p><p class="depth0">13. Use of Official Fishing License or Permit Databases. Offeror  expressly acknowledges that NMFS shall use the appropriate official  governmental fishing license or permit database to:</p><p class="depth0">Determine the Offeror's address of record; verify the Offeror's  qualification to offer; determine the holder of record of the Groundfish  Reduction Permit and Reduction Permit(s); and verify the Offeror's  inclusion in the offer of all permits and licenses required to be  offered in the Offer.</p><p class="depth0">14. Use of National Vessel Documentation Center Database. Offeror  expressly acknowledges that NMFS shall use the records of the National  Vessel Documentation Center to determine the owner of record for a  federally documented Reduction Privilege Vessel and the appropriate  State records to determine the owner of record of a non-federally  documented Reduction Privilege Vessel.</p><p class="depth0">15. Offeror to Ensure Accurate Records. Offeror shall, to the best  of its ability, ensure that the records of the databases relevant to  sections 13 and 14 of this contract are true, accurate, and complete.</p><p class="depth0">16. Submissions are Irrevocable. The parties hereto expressly  acknowledge as the essence hereof that the Offeror voluntarily submits  to NMFS this firm and irrevocable offer. The Offeror expressly  acknowledges that it hereby waives any privilege or right to withdraw,  change, modify, alter, rescind, or cancel any portion of the Reduction  Contract and that the receipt date and time which NMFS marks on the  Reduction Contract constitutes the date and time of the offer's  submission.</p><p class="depth0">17. Offer Rejection. NMFS shall reject an offer that NMFS deems is  in any way unresponsive or not in conformance with the Reduction  Contract, and the applicable law or regulations unless the Offeror  corrects the defect and NMFS, in its sole discretion, accepts the  correction.</p><p class="depth0">18. Notarized Offeror Signature(s) Required. NMFS shall deem as non- responsive and reject an offer whose Offer Submission Form does not  contain the notarized signatures of all persons required to sign the  form on behalf of the Offeror.</p><p class="depth0">19. Offer Rejections Constitute Final Agency Action. NMFS's offer  rejections are conclusive and constitute final agency action as of the  rejection date.</p><p class="depth0">20. Effect of Offer Submission. Submitting an irrevocable offer  conforming to the requirements stated herein entitles the Offeror to  have NMFS accept the offer if NMFS, in its sole discretion, deems that  the offer is fully responsive and complies with the Act, the final rule  and any other rule promulgated pursuant to the Act.</p><p class="depth0">21. Offeror Retains Use. After submitting an offer, the Offeror  shall continue to hold, own, or retain unimpaired every aspect of any  and all LLP License(s) and or vessels set forth on an Offer included as  Reduction Fishing Interests, until such time as: NMFS notifies the  Offeror that the Reduction Plan is not in compliance with the Act or  other applicable law and will not be approved by NMFS; notifies the  Offeror that the referendum was unsuccessful; NMFS tenders the reduction  payment and the Offeror complies with its obligations under the  Reduction Contract; or NMFS otherwise excuses the Offeror's performance.</p><p class="depth0">22. Acceptance by Referendum. NMFS shall formally notify the Offeror  in writing whether the referendum is successful, which written notice  shall inform Offeror that the condition subsequent has been satisfied.  Therefore, Offeror expressly acknowledges that all parties must perform  under the Reduction Contract and the Reduction Contract is enforceable  against, and binding on, the Reduction Contract parties in accordance  with the terms and conditions herein.</p><p class="depth0">23. Reduction Contract Subject to Federal Law. The Reduction  Contract is subject to Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">24. Notice to Creditors. Upon NMFS' offer acceptance notice to the  Offeror, Offeror agrees to notify all parties with secured interests in  the Reduction Fishing Interests that the Offeror has entered into the  Reduction Contract.</p><p class="depth0">25. Referendum. Offeror acknowledges that the outcome of the  referendum of the Reduction Plan is an occurrence over which NMFS has no  control.</p><p class="depth0">26. Unsuccessful Referendum Excuses Performance. An unsuccessful  referendum excuses all parties hereto from every obligation to perform  under the Reduction Contract. In such event, NMFS need not tender  reduction payment and the Offeror need not surrender and relinquish or  allow the revocation or restriction of any element of the Reduction  Fishing Interest specified in the Reduction Contract. An unsuccessful  referendum shall cause the Reduction Contract to have no further force  or effect.</p><p class="depth0">27. Offeror Responsibilities upon Successful Referendum. Upon NMFS'  formal notification to the Offeror that the referendum was successful  and that NMFS had accepted the Reduction Contract, Offeror shall  immediately become ready to surrender and relinquish and allow the  revocation or restriction of (as NMFS deems appropriate) the Reduction  Fishing Interests.</p><p class="depth0">28. Written Payment Instructions. After a successful referendum,  NMFS shall tender reduction payment by requesting the Offeror to provide  to NMFS, and the Offeror shall subsequently so provide, written payment  instructions for NMFS' disbursement of the reduction payment to the  Offeror or to the Offeror's order.</p><p class="depth0">29. Request for Written Payment Instructions Constitutes Tender.  NMFS' request to the Offeror for written payment instructions  constitutes reduction payment tender, as specified in 50 CFR 600.1011.</p><p class="depth0">30. Offeror Responsibilities upon Tender. Upon NMFS' reduction  payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror shall immediately surrender  and relinquish and allow the revocation or restriction of (as NMFS deems  appropriate) the Reduction Fishing Interests. The Offeror must then  return the original of its Groundfish Reduction Permit and Reduction  Permit(s) to NMFS. Concurrently with NMFS' reduction payment tender, the  Offeror shall forever cease all fishing for any species with the  Reduction Privilege Vessel and immediately retrieve all fishing gear,  irrespective of ownership, previously deployed from the Reduction  Privilege Vessel. Offeror agrees to authorize the United States Coast  Guard to cancel the fishery endorsement in the Reduction Privilege  Vessel.</p><p class="depth0">31. Reduction Privilege Vessel Lacking Federal Documentation. Upon  NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror shall  immediately scrap any vessel which the Offeror specified as a Reduction  Privilege Vessel and which is documented solely under state law or  otherwise lacks documentation under Federal law. The Offeror shall scrap  such vessel at the Offeror's expense. The Offeror shall allow NMFS, its  agents, or its appointees reasonable opportunity to observe and confirm  such scrapping. The Offeror shall conclude such scrapping within a  reasonable time.</p><p class="depth0">32. Future Harvest Privilege and Reduction Fishing History  Extinguished. Upon NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the  Offeror shall surrender and relinquish and consent to the revocation,  restriction, withdrawal, invalidation, or extinguishment by other means  (as NMFS deems appropriate), of any claim in any way related to any  fishing privilege derived, in whole or in part, from the use or  holdership of the Groundfish Reduction Permits and the Reduction  Permit(s), from the use or ownership of the Reduction Privilege Vessel  (subject to and in accordance with the provisions of section 8 of this  contract), and from any documented harvest fishing history arising under  or associated with the same which could ever qualify the Offeror for any  future limited access fishing license, fishing permit, and other harvest  authorization of any kind.</p><p class="depth0">33. Post Tender Use of Federally Documented Reduction Privilege  Vessel. After NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror  may continue to use a federally documented Reduction Privilege Vessel  for any lawful purpose except ``fishing'' as defined under the Magnuson- Stevens Act and may transfer--subject to all restrictions in the  Reduction Contract, other applicable regulations, and the applicable  law--the vessel to a new owner. The Offeror or any subsequent owner  shall only operate the Reduction Privilege Vessel under the United  States flag and shall not operate such vessel under the authority of a  foreign country. In the event the Offeror fails to abide by such  restrictions, the Offeror expressly acknowledges and hereby agrees to  allow NMFS to pursue any and all remedies available to it, including,  but not limited to, recovering the reduction payment and seizing the  Reduction Privilege Vessel and scrapping it at the Offeror's expense.</p><p class="depth0">34. NMFS' Actions upon Tender. Contemporaneously with NMFS'  reduction payment tender to the Offeror, and without regard to the  Offeror's refusal or failure to perform any of its Reduction Contract  duties and obligations, NMFS shall: Permanently revoke the Offeror's  Groundfish Reduction Permit and Reduction Permit(s); notify the National  Vessel Documentation Center to permanently revoke the Reduction  Privilege Vessel's fishery trade endorsement; notify the U.S. Maritime  Administration to make the   Reduction Privilege Vessel permanently ineligible for the approval of  requests to place the vessel under foreign registry or operate the  vessel under a foreign country's authority; record in the appropriate  NMFS records that the Reduction Fishing History represented by any  documented harvest fishing history accrued on, under, or as a result of  the operation of the Reduction Privilege Vessel and/or Reduction Fishing  Vessel (subject to and in accordance with the provisions of section 8 of  this contract), the Groundfish Reduction Permit, and the Reduction  Permit(s) which could ever qualify the Offeror for any future limited  access fishing license, fishing permit, or other harvesting privilege of  any kind shall never again be available to anyone for any fisheries  purpose; and implement any other restrictions the applicable law or  regulations impose.</p><p class="depth0">35. Material Disputes to be Identified. Members of the public shall,  up until NMFS receives the Offeror's written payment instructions, be  able to advise NMFS in writing of any material dispute with regard to  any aspect of any accepted Reduction Contract. Such a material dispute  shall neither relieve the Offeror of any Reduction Contract duties or  obligations nor affect NMFS' right to enforce performance of the  Reduction Contract terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth0">36. Reduction Payment Disbursement. Once NMFS receives the Offeror's  written payment instructions and certification of compliance with the  Reduction Contract, NMFS shall as soon as practicable disburse the  reduction payment to the Offeror. Reduction payment disbursement shall  be in strict accordance with the Offeror's written payment instructions.  Unless the Offeror's written payment instructions direct NMFS to the  contrary, NMFS shall disburse the whole of the reduction payment to the  Offeror. If the qualifying Offeror offers with a co-Offeror, both the  qualifying Offeror and the co-Offeror must approve and sign the written  payment instructions.</p><p class="depth0">37. Reduction Payment Withheld for Scrapping or for Other Reasons.  In the event that a Reduction Privilege Vessel which is not under  Federal documentation must be scrapped, NMFS shall withhold from  reduction payment disbursement an amount sufficient to scrap such  vessel. NMFS shall withhold such sum until the vessel is completely  scrapped before disbursing any amount withheld. NMFS may confirm, if  NMFS so chooses, that the vessel has been scrapped before disbursing any  amount withheld. If NMFS has reason to believe the Offeror has failed to  comply with any of the Reduction Contract terms and conditions, NMFS  shall also withhold reduction payment disbursement until such time as  the Offeror performs in accordance with the Reduction Contract terms and  conditions.</p><p class="depth0">38. Offeror Assistance with Restriction. The Offeror shall, upon  NMFS' request, furnish such additional documents, undertakings,  assurances, or take such other actions as may be reasonably required to  enable NMFS' revocation, restriction, invalidation, withdrawal, or  extinguishment by other means (as NMFS deems appropriate) of all  components of the Reduction Contract's Reduction Fishing Interest in  accordance with the requirements of the Reduction Contract terms and  conditions, applicable regulations and the applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">39. Recordation of Restrictions. Upon the Reduction Fishing  Privilege's revocation, the Offeror shall do everything reasonably  necessary to ensure that such revocation is recorded on the Reduction  Privilege Vessel's Federal documentation (which the National Vessel  Documentation Center maintains in accordance with Federal maritime law  and regulations) in such manner as is acceptable to NMFS and as shall  prevent the Reduction Privilege Vessel, regardless of its subsequent  ownership, from ever again being eligible for a fishery trade  endorsement or ever again fishing. The term ``fishing'' includes the  full range of activities defined in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).</p><p class="depth0">40. Reduction Element Omission. In the event NMFS accepts the offer  and the Offeror has failed, for any reason, to specify in the Reduction  Contract any Groundfish Reduction Permit, non-Groundfish Reduction  Permit(s), Reduction Privilege Vessel, Reduction Fishing Vessel,  Reduction Fishing History, or any other element of the Reduction Fishing  Interest which the Offeror should under Reduction Contract, applicable  regulations and the applicable law have specified in Reduction Contract,  such omitted element shall nevertheless be deemed to be included in the  Reduction Contract and to be subject to the Reduction Contract's terms  and conditions; and all Reduction Contract terms and conditions which  should have applied to such omitted element had it not be omitted shall  apply as if such element had not been omitted. Upon the Offeror  discovering any such omission, the Offeror shall immediately and fully  advise NMFS of such omission. Upon either NMFS or the Offeror  discovering any such omission, the Offeror shall act in accordance with  the Reduction Contract, applicable regulations and the applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">41. Remedy for Breach. Because money damages are not a sufficient  remedy for the Offeror breaching any one or more of the Reduction  Contract terms and conditions, the Offeror explicitly agrees to and  hereby authorizes specific performance of the Reduction Contract, in  addition to any money damages, as a remedy for such breach. In the event  of such breach, NMFS shall take any reasonable action, including  requiring and   enforcing specific performance of the Reduction Contract, NMFS deems  necessary to carry out the Reduction Contract, applicable regulations  and the applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">42. Waiver of Data Confidentiality. The Offeror consents to the  public release of any information provided in connection with the  Reduction Contract or pursuant to Reduction Plan requirements, including  any information provided in the Reduction Contract or by any other means  associated with, or necessary for evaluation of, the Offeror's Reduction  Contract if NMFS finds that the release of such information is necessary  to achieve the Reduction Plan's authorized purpose. The Offeror hereby  explicitly waives any claim of confidentiality otherwise afforded to  catch, or harvest data and fishing histories otherwise protected from  release under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management  Act (16 U.S.C. 1881 a(b)) or any other law. In the event of such  information release, the Offeror hereby forever fully and  unconditionally releases and holds harmless the United States and its  officers, agents, employees, representatives, of and from any and all  claims, demands, debts, damages, duties, causes of action, actions and  suits whatsoever, in law or equity, on account of any act, failure to  act or event arising from, out of, or in any way related to, the release  of any information associated with the Reduction Program.</p><p class="depth0">43. Oral Agreement Invalid. The Reduction Contract, any addendums to  section 46 of this contract, and enclosures of photocopies of licenses  and permits required under section 46 of this contract, contain the  final terms and conditions of the agreement between the Offeror and NMFS  and represent the entire and exclusive agreement between them. NMFS and  the Offeror forever waive all right to sue, or otherwise counterclaim  against each other, based on any claim of past, present, or future oral  agreement between them.</p><p class="depth0">44. Severable Provisions. The Reduction Contract provisions are  severable; and, in the event that any portion of the Reduction Contract  is held to be void, invalid, non-binding, or otherwise unenforceable,  the remaining portion thereof shall remain fully valid, binding, and  enforceable against the Offeror and NMFS.</p><p class="depth0">45. Disputes. Any and all disputes involving the Reduction Contract,  and any other Reduction Plan aspect affecting them shall in all respects  be governed by the Federal laws of the United States; and the Offeror  and all other parties claiming under the Offeror irrevocably submit  themselves to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts of the United  States and/or to any other Federal administrative body which the  applicable law authorizes to adjudicate such disputes.</p><p class="depth0">46. Fishing Capacity Reduction Offer Submission Form and Reduction  Fishing Interests Identification.</p><p class="depth0">a. Completion and Submission. The Offeror must fully, faithfully,  and accurately complete this section 46 of this contract and thereafter  submit the full and complete Reduction Contract to NMFS in accordance  with the Reduction Contract. If completing this section requires  inserting more information than the places provided for the insertion of  such information allows, the Offeror should attach an addendum to the  Reduction Contract that: Includes and identifies the additional  information, states that the addendum is a part of the Reduction Fishing  Interests Identification portion of the Reduction Contract, states (as a  means of identifying the Reduction Contract to which the addendum  relates) the NMFS license number designated on the Reduction Contract's  Groundfish Reduction Permit, and is signed by all persons who signed the  Reduction Contract as the Offeror.</p><p class="depth0">b.

A co-Offeror is not  allowed for either the Groundfish Reduction Permit or the Reduction  Permit(s). If the Offeror is also the owner of record, at the time of  offering, of the Reduction Privilege Vessel, the qualifying Offeror is  the sole Offeror. If, however, the owner of record, at the time of  execution of this Reduction Contract, of the Reduction Privilege Vessel  is not exactly the same as the Offeror, then the owner of record is the  co-Offeror; and the Offeror and the co-Offeror jointly offer together as  the Offeror.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------ OFFEROR NAME(S) If Offeror or co-   Check appropriate box for each name</p><p class="depth0">Offeror consists of more than        listed in the adjacent column</p><p class="depth0">one owner, use one row of this  ---------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">column to name each co-Offeror.</p><p class="depth0">If not, use only one row for                          Co-Offeror (if</p><p class="depth0">Offeror and one row for any co-        Offeror              any)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (2) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (5) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this contract the Offeror's and the co-Offeror's  (if there is a co-Offeror) full and exact address(s) of record, and  check the appropriate box for each address listed.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ OFFEROR ADDRESS(S) If Offeror or  Check appropriate box for each address co-Offeror consists of more than       listed in the adjacent column</p><p class="depth0">one owner, use one row of this  ---------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">column for address of each co-</p><p class="depth0">owner.
