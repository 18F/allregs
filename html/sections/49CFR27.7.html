in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Afford a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not substantially equal to that afforded persons who are not disabled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a qualified person with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as persons who are not disabled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to persons with a disability or to any class of persons with a disability unless such action is necessary to provide qualified persons with a disability with aid, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to persons who are not disabled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified person with a disability by providing financial or other assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Deny a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in conferences, in planning or advising recipients, applicants or would-be applicants, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Otherwise limit a qualified person with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for persons with and without a disability, but must afford persons with a disability equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting that is reasonably achievable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Even if separate or different aid, benefits, or services are available to persons with a disability, a recipient may not deny a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in the programs or activities that are not separate or different.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That have the effect of subjecting qualified persons with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially reducing the likelihood that persons with a disability can benefit by the objectives of the recipient's program or activity, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That yield or perpetuate discrimination against another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant or a recipient may not make selections:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That have the effect of excluding persons with a disability from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to persons with a disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As used in this section, the aid benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Communications. Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal law. For aid, benefits, or services authorized by Federal statute or executive order that are designed especially for persons with a disability, or for a particular class of persons with a disability, the exclusion of persons without a disability or other classes of

persons with a disability is not prohibited by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reasonable accommodations. A recipient shall make reasonable accommodations in policies, practices, or procedures when such accommodations are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability unless the recipient can demonstrate that making the accommodations would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or result in an undue financial and administrative burden. For the purposes of this section, the term reasonable accommodation shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the term ``reasonable modifications'' as set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act title II regulations at 28 CFR 35.130(b)(7), and not as it is defined or interpreted for the purposes of employment discrimination under title I of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12111-12112) and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1630.
