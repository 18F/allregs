                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Appliance means any device which contains and uses a refrigerant and  which is used for household or commercial purposes, including any air  conditioner, refrigerator, chiller, or freezer.</p><p class="depth0">Apprentice means any person who is currently registered as an  apprentice in service, maintenance, repair, or disposal of appliances  with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship and  Training (or a State Apprenticeship Council recognized by the Bureau of  Apprenticeship and Training). If more than two years have elapsed since  the person first registered as an apprentice with the Bureau of  Apprenticeship and Training (or a State Apprenticeship Council  recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship   and Training), the person shall not be considered an apprentice.</p><p class="depth0">Approved equipment testing organization means any organization which  has applied for and received approval from the Administrator pursuant to  Sec. 82.160.</p><p class="depth0">Certified refrigerant recovery or recycling equipment means  equipment manufactured before November 15, 1993, that meets the  standards in Sec. 82.158(c), (e), or (g); equipment certified by an  approved equipment testing organization to meet the standards in  Sec. 82.158(b), (d), or (f); or equipment certified pursuant to  Sec. 82.36(a).</p><p class="depth0">Commercial refrigeration means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i),  the refrigeration appliances utilized in the retail food and cold  storage warehouse sectors. Retail food includes the refrigeration  equipment found in supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and  other food service establishments. Cold storage includes the equipment  used to store meat, produce, dairy products, and other perishable goods.  All of the equipment contains large refrigerant charges, typically over  75 pounds.</p><p class="depth0">Critical component means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), a  component without which industrial process refrigeration equipment will  not function, will be unsafe in its intended environment, and/or will be  subject to failures that would cause the industrial process served by  the refrigeration appliance to be unsafe.</p><p class="depth0">Custom-built means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), that the  equipment or any of its critical components cannot be purchased and/or  installed without being uniquely designed, fabricated and/or assembled  to satisfy a specific set of industrial process conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal means the process leading to and including:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The discharge, deposit, dumping or placing of any discarded  appliance into or on any land or water;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The disassembly of any appliance for discharge, deposit, dumping  or placing of its discarded component parts into or on any land or  water; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The disassembly of any appliance for reuse of its component  parts.</p><p class="depth0">Follow-up verification test means, for the purposes of  Sec. 82.156(i), those tests that involve checking the repairs within 30  days of the appliance's returning to normal operating characteristics  and conditions. Follow-up verification tests for appliances from which  the refrigerant charge has been evacuated means a test conducted after  the appliance or portion of the appliance has resumed operation at  normal operating characteristics and conditions of temperature and  pressure, except in cases where sound professional judgment dictates  that these tests will be more meaningful if performed prior to the  return to normal operating characteristics and conditions. A follow-up  verification test with respect to repairs conducted without evacuation  of the refrigerant charge means a reverification test conducted after  the initial verification test and usually within 30 days of normal  operating conditions. Where an appliance is not evacuated, it is only  necessary to conclude any required changes in pressure, temperature or  other conditions to return the appliance to normal operating  characteristics and conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Full charge means the amount of refrigerant required for normal  operating characteristics and conditions of the appliance as determined  by using one or a combination of the following four methods:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Use the equipment manufacturer's determination of the correct  full charge for the equipment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Determine the full charge by making appropriate calculations  based on component sizes, density of refrigerant, volume of piping, and  other relevant considerations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Use actual measurements of the amount of refrigerant added or  evacuated from the appliance; and/or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Use an established range based on the best available data  regarding the normal operating characteristics and conditions for the  appliance, where the midpoint of the range will serve as the full  charge, and where records are maintained in accordance with  Sec. 82.166(q).</p><p class="depth0">High-pressure appliance means an appliance that uses a refrigerant  with a liquid phase saturation pressure between 170 psia and 355 psia at  104 F.

These  appliances are directly linked to the industrial process. This sector  also includes industrial ice machines, appliances used directly in the  generation of electricity, and ice rinks. Where one appliance is used  for both industrial process refrigeration and other applications, it  will be considered industrial process refrigeration equipment if 50  percent or more of its operating capacity is used for industrial process  refrigeration.</p><p class="depth0">Industrial process shutdown means, for the purposes of  Sec. 82.156(i), that an industrial process or facility temporarily  ceases to operate or manufacture whatever is being produced at that  facility.</p><p class="depth0">Initial verification test means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i),  those leak tests that are conducted as soon as practicable after the  repair is completed. An initial verification test, with regard to the  leak repairs that require the evacuation of the appliance or portion of  the appliance, means a test conducted prior to the replacement of the  full refrigerant charge and before the appliance or portion of the  appliance has reached operation at normal operating characteristics and  conditions of temperature and pressure. An initial verification test  with regard to repairs conducted without the evacuation of the  refrigerant charge means a test conducted as soon as practicable after  the conclusion of the repair work.</p><p class="depth0">Leak rate means the rate at which an appliance is losing  refrigerant, measured between refrigerant charges. The leak rate is  expressed in terms of the percentage of the appliance's full charge that  would be lost over a 12-month period if the current rate of loss were to  continue over that period. The rate is calculated using only one of the  following methods for all appliances located at an operating facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Method 1. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. Take the number of pounds of refrigerant  added to the appliance to return it to a full charge and divide it by  the number of pounds of refrigerant the appliance normally contains at  full charge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. Take the shorter of the number of days that have passed  since the last day refrigerant was added or 365 days and divide that  number by 365 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3. Take the number calculated in Step 1. and divide it by  the number calculated in Step 2.; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Step 4. Multiply the number calculated in Step 3. by 100 to  calculate a percentage. This method is summarized in the following  formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JA05.010</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Method 2. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. Take the sum of the quantity of  refrigerant added to the appliance over the previous 365-day period (or  over the period that has passed since leaks in the appliance were last  repaired, if that period is less than one year),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. Divide the result of Step 1. by the quantity (e.g.,  pounds) of refrigerant the appliance normally contains at full charge,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3. Multiply the result of Step 2. by 100 to obtain a  percentage. This method is summarized in the following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JA05.011</p><p class="depth3">Low-loss fitting means any device that is intended to establish a  connection between hoses, appliances, or recovery or recycling machines  and that is designed to close automatically or to be closed manually  when disconnected, minimizing the release of refrigerant from hoses,  appliances, and recovery or recycling machines.</p><p class="depth3">Low-pressure appliance means an appliance that uses a refrigerant  with a liquid phase saturation pressure below 45 psia at 104 F. This  definition includes but is not limited to appliances using R-11, R-123,  and R-113.</p><p class="depth3">Major maintenance, service, or repair means any maintenance,  service, or repair that involves the removal of any or all of the  following appliance components: compressor, condenser, evaporator, or  auxiliary heat exchange coil; or any maintenance, service, or repair  that involves uncovering an opening of more than four (4) square inches  of ``flow area'' for more than 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth3">Medium-pressure appliance means an appliance that uses a refrigerant  with a liquid phase saturation pressure between 45 psia and 170 psia at  104 F.
