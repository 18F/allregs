                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A public accommodation shall remove architectural barriers in

existing facilities, including communication barriers that are structural in nature, where such removal is readily achievable, i.e., easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. Examples of steps to remove barriers include, but are not limited to, the following actions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Installing ramps;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Repositioning shelves;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks, and other furniture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Repositioning telephones;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Installing flashing alarm lights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Widening doors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Installing offset hinges to widen doorways;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible path;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Installing accessible door hardware;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Installing grab bars in toilet stalls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Installing a raised toilet seat;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Installing a full-length bathroom mirror;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Creating designated accessible parking spaces;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an existing inaccessible water fountain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Removing high pile, low density carpeting; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Installing vehicle hand controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Priorities. A public accommodation is urged to take measures to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section in accordance with the following order of priorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, a public accommodation should take measures to provide access to a place of public accommodation from public sidewalks, parking, or public transportation. These measures include, for example, installing an entrance ramp, widening entrances, and providing accessible parking spaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second, a public accommodation should take measures to provide access to those areas of a place of public accommodation where goods and services are made available to the public. These measures include, for example, adjusting the layout of display racks, rearranging tables, providing Brailled and raised character signage, widening doors, providing visual alarms, and installing ramps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third, a public accommodation should take measures to provide access to restroom facilities. These measures include, for example, removal of obstructing furniture or vending machines, widening of doors, installation of ramps, providing accessible signage, widening of toilet stalls, and installation of grab bars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fourth, a public accommodation should take any other measures necessary to provide access to the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Relationship to alterations requirements of subpart D of this part. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, measures taken to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section shall comply with the applicable requirements for alterations in Sec.  36.402 and Sec. Sec.  36.404 through 36.406 of this part for the element being altered. The path of travel requirements of Sec.  36.403 shall not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)(i)</em> Safe harbor. Elements that have not been altered in existing facilities on or after March 15, 2012 and that comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards are not required to be modified in order to comply with the requirements set forth in the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Safe harbor. Elements that have not been altered in existing facilities on or after March 15, 2012 and that comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards are not required to be modified in order to comply with the requirements set forth in the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Safe harbor. Elements that have not been altered in existing facilities on or after March 15, 2012 and that comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards are not required to be modified in order to comply with the requirements set forth in the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> Before March 15, 2012, elements in existing facilities that do not comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards must be modified to the extent readily achievable to comply with either the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards. Noncomplying newly constructed and altered elements may also be subject to the requirements of Sec.  36.406(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Before March 15, 2012, elements in existing facilities that do not comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards must be modified to the extent readily achievable to comply with either the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards.

Noncomplying newly constructed and altered elements may also be subject to the requirements of Sec.  36.406(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The safe harbor provided in Sec.  36.304(d)(2)(i) does not apply to those elements in existing facilities that are subject to supplemental requirements (i.e., elements for which there are neither technical nor scoping specifications in the 1991 Standards), and therefore those elements must be modified to the extent readily achievable to comply with the 2010 Standards. Noncomplying newly constructed and altered elements may also be subject to the requirements of Sec.  36.406(a)(5). Elements in the 2010 Standards not eligible for the element-by-element safe harbor are identified as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Residential facilities and dwelling units, sections 233 and 809.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amusement rides, sections 234 and 1002; 206.2.9; 216.12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Recreational boating facilities, sections 235 and 1003; 206.2.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exercise machines and equipment, sections 236 and 1004; 206.2.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Fishing piers and platforms, sections 237 and 1005; 206.2.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Golf facilities, sections 238 and 1006; 206.2.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Miniature golf facilities, sections 239 and 1007; 206.2.16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Play areas, sections 240 and 1008; 206.2.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Saunas and steam rooms, sections 241 and 612.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Swimming pools, wading pools, and spas, sections 242 and 1009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Shooting facilities with firing positions, sections 243 and 1010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Miscellaneous.

Such measures include, for example, providing a ramp with a steeper slope or widening a doorway to a narrower width than that mandated by the alterations requirements. No measure shall be taken, however, that poses a significant risk to the health or safety of individuals with disabilities or others.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix to Sec.  36.304(d)</p><p class="depth0">Compliance Dates and Applicable Standards for Barrier Removal and Safe Harbor----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Date                                    Requirement                    Applicable standards----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before March 15, 2012...................
