                            <p class="depth0">If the contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations  through the advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit  analysis following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of  the cost-benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will  recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition,  develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following  570.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government  cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs  through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance  with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How the contracting officer performed the cost-benefit analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other  offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that  the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.
