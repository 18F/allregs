                                Sec. 931.7  Redemption and repurchase of capital stock.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Redemption. A member may have its capital stock in a Bank redeemed by providing written notice to the Bank in accordance with this section. For Class A stock, a member shall provide six-months written notice, and for Class B stock a member shall provide five-years written notice. The notice shall indicate the number of shares of Bank stock that are to be redeemed, and a member shall not have more than one notice of redemption outstanding at one time for the same shares of Bank stock. A member may cancel a notice of redemption by so informing the Bank in writing, and the Bank may impose a fee (to be specified in its capital plan) on any member that cancels a pending notice of redemption. At the expiration of the applicable notice period, the Bank shall pay the stated par value of that stock to the member in cash. A request by a member (whose membership has not been terminated) to redeem specific shares of stock shall automatically be cancelled if the Bank is prevented from redeeming the member's stock by paragraph (c) of this section within five business days from the end of the expiration of the applicable redemption notice period because the member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the stock of the Bank after such redemption. The automatic cancellation of a member's redemption request shall have the same effect as if the member had cancelled its notice to redeem stock prior to the end of the redemption notice period, and a Bank may impose a fee (to be specified in its capital plan) for automatic cancellation of a redemption request. A Bank

shall not be obligated to redeem its capital stock other than in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repurchase. A Bank, in its discretion and without regard to the applicable redemption periods, may repurchase from a member any outstanding Class A or Class B capital stock that is in excess of the amount of that class of Bank stock that the member is required to hold as a minimum investment, in accordance with the capital plan of that Bank. A Bank undertaking such a stock repurchase at its own initiative shall provide the member with reasonable notice prior to repurchasing any excess stock, with the period of such notice to be specified in the Bank's capital plan, and shall pay the stated par value of that stock to the member in cash. For purposes of this section, any Bank stock owned by a member shall be considered to be excess stock if the member is not required to hold such stock either as a condition of remaining a member of the Bank or as a condition of obtaining advances or transacting other business with the Bank. A member's submission of a notice of intent to withdraw from membership, or its termination of membership in any other manner, shall not, in and of itself, cause any Bank stock to be deemed excess stock for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation. In no event may a Bank redeem or repurchase any stock if, following the redemption or repurchase, the Bank would fail to meet any minimum capital requirement, or if the member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the stock of the Bank, as required by Sec. 931.3.
