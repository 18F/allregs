                                Sec. 1.6011-4  Requirement of statement disclosing participation in
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Every taxpayer that has participated, as described  in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in a reportable transaction within  the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section and who is required to file  a tax return must file within the time prescribed in paragraph (e) of  this section a disclosure statement in the form prescribed by paragraph  (d) of this section. The fact that a transaction is a reportable  transaction shall not affect the legal determination of whether the  taxpayer's treatment of the transaction is proper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reportable transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A reportable  transaction is a transaction described in any of the paragraphs (b)(2)  through (7) of this section. The term transaction includes all of the  factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any  investment, entity, plan, or arrangement, and includes any series of  steps carried out as part of a plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Listed transactions. A listed transaction is a transaction that  is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of  transactions that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined to  be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation, or  other form of published guidance as a listed transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Confidential transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A confidential  transaction is a   transaction that is offered to a taxpayer under conditions of  confidentiality and for which the taxpayer has paid an advisor a minimum  fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions of confidentiality. A transaction is considered to  be offered to a taxpayer under conditions of confidentiality if the  advisor who is paid the minimum fee places a limitation on disclosure by  the taxpayer of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction  and the limitation on disclosure protects the confidentiality of that  advisor's tax strategies. A transaction is treated as confidential even  if the conditions of confidentiality are not legally binding on the  taxpayer. A claim that a transaction is proprietary or exclusive is not  treated as a limitation on disclosure if the advisor confirms to the  taxpayer that there is no limitation on disclosure of the tax treatment  or tax structure of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimum fee. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the  minimum fee is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $250,000 for a transaction if the taxpayer is a corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $50,000 for all other transactions unless the taxpayer is a  partnership or trust, all of the owners or beneficiaries of which are  corporations (looking through any partners or beneficiaries that are  themselves partnerships or trusts), in which case the minimum fee is  $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Determination of minimum fee. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(3), in determining the minimum fee, all fees for a tax strategy or  for services for advice (whether or not tax advice) or for the  implementation of a transaction are taken into account. Fees include  consideration in whatever form paid, whether in cash or in kind, for  services to analyze the transaction (whether or not related to the tax  consequences of the transaction), for services to implement the  transaction, for services to document the transaction, and for services  to prepare tax returns to the extent return preparation fees are  unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances. For purposes of  this paragraph (b)(3), a taxpayer also is treated as paying fees to an  advisor if the taxpayer knows or should know that the amount it pays  will be paid indirectly to the advisor, such as through a referral fee  or fee-sharing arrangement. A fee does not include amounts paid to a  person, including an advisor, in that person's capacity as a party to  the transaction. For example, a fee does not include reasonable charges  for the use of capital or the sale or use of property. The IRS will  scrutinize carefully all of the facts and circumstances in determining  whether consideration received in connection with a confidential  transaction constitutes fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Related parties. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), persons  who bear a relationship to each other as described in section 267(b) or  707(b) will be treated as the same person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transactions with contractual protection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  transaction with contractual protection is a transaction for which the  taxpayer or a related party (as described in section 267(b) or 707(b))  has the right to a full or partial refund of fees (as described in  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) if all or part of the intended tax  consequences from the transaction are not sustained. A transaction with  contractual protection also is a transaction for which fees (as  described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) are contingent on the  taxpayer's realization of tax benefits from the transaction. All the  facts and circumstances relating to the transaction will be considered  when determining whether a fee is refundable or contingent, including  the right to reimbursements of amounts that the parties to the  transaction have not designated as fees or any agreement to provide  services without reasonable compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fees. Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section only applies with  respect to fees paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer or a related party  to any person who makes or provides a statement, oral or written, to the  taxpayer or related party (or for whose benefit a statement is made or  provided to the taxpayer or related party) as to the potential tax  consequences that may result from the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Termination of transaction. A transaction is  not considered to have contractual protection solely because a party to  the transaction has the right to terminate the transaction upon the  happening of an   event affecting the taxation of one or more parties to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Previously reported transaction. If a person makes or provides a  statement to a taxpayer as to the potential tax consequences that may  result from a transaction only after the taxpayer has entered into the  transaction and reported the consequences of the transaction on a filed  tax return, and the person has not previously received fees from the  taxpayer relating to the transaction, then any refundable or contingent  fees are not taken into account in determining whether the transaction  has contractual protection. This paragraph (b)(4) does not provide any  substantive rules regarding when a person may charge refundable or  contingent fees with respect to a transaction. See Circular 230, 31 CFR  part 10, for the regulations governing practice before the IRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Loss transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A loss transaction is any  transaction resulting in the taxpayer claiming a loss under section 165  of at least--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $10 million in any single taxable year or $20 million in any  combination of taxable years for corporations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $10 million in any single taxable year or $20 million in any  combination of taxable years for partnerships that have only  corporations as partners (looking through any partners that are  themselves partnerships), whether or not any losses flow through to one  or more partners; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> $2 million in any single taxable year or $4 million in any  combination of taxable years for all other partnerships, whether or not  any losses flow through to one or more partners;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> $2 million in any single taxable year or $4 million in any  combination of taxable years for individuals, S corporations, or trusts,  whether or not any losses flow through to one or more shareholders or  beneficiaries; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> $50,000 in any single taxable year for individuals or trusts,  whether or not the loss flows through from an S corporation or  partnership, if the loss arises with respect to a section 988  transaction (as defined in section 988(c)(1) relating to foreign  currency transactions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cumulative losses. In determining whether a transaction results  in a taxpayer claiming a loss that meets the threshold amounts over a  combination of taxable years as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this  section, only losses claimed in the taxable year that the transaction is  entered into and the five succeeding taxable years are combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 165 loss--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of this section, in  determining the thresholds in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the  amount of a section 165 loss is adjusted for any salvage value and for  any insurance or other compensation received. See Sec. 1.165-1(c)(4).  However, a section 165 loss does not take into account offsetting gains,  or other income or limitations. For example, a section 165 loss does not  take into account the limitation in section 165(d) (relating to wagering  losses) or the limitations in sections 165(f), 1211, and 1212 (relating  to capital losses). The full amount of a section 165 loss is taken into  account for the year in which the loss is sustained, regardless of  whether all or part of the loss enters into the computation of a net  operating loss under section 172 or a net capital loss under section  1212 that is a carryback or carryover to another year. A section 165  loss does not include any portion of a loss, attributable to a capital  loss carryback or carryover from another year, that is treated as a  deemed capital loss under section 1212.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of this section, a section 165 loss includes an  amount deductible pursuant to a provision that treats a transaction as a  sale or other disposition, or otherwise results in a deduction under  section 165. A section 165 loss includes, for example, a loss resulting  from a sale or exchange of a partnership interest under section 741 and  a loss resulting from a section 988 transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Transactions of interest. A transaction of interest is a  transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the  types of transactions that the IRS has identified by notice, regulation,  or other form of published guidance as a transaction of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A transaction will not be considered  a reportable transaction, or will be excluded   from any individual category of reportable transaction under paragraphs  (b)(3) through (7) of this section, if the Commissioner makes a  determination by published guidance that the transaction is not subject  to the reporting requirements of this section. The Commissioner may make  a determination by individual letter ruling under paragraph (f) of this  section that an individual letter ruling request on a specific  transaction satisfies the reporting requirements of this section with  regard to that transaction for the taxpayer who requests the individual  letter ruling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for RICs. For purposes of this section, a  regulated investment company (RIC) as defined in section 851 or an  investment vehicle that is owned 95 percent or more by one or more RICs  at all times during the course of the transaction is not required to  disclose a transaction that is described in any of paragraphs (b)(3)  through (5) and (b)(7) of this section unless the transaction is also a  listed transaction or a transaction of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, including S corporations. Except as otherwise  specifically provided in this section, the term taxpayer also includes  an affiliated group of corporations that joins in the filing of a  consolidated return under section 1501.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporation. When used specifically in this section, the term  corporation means an entity that is required to file a return for a  taxable year on any 1120 series form, or successor form, excluding S  corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Participation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Listed transactions. A  taxpayer has participated in a listed transaction if the taxpayer's tax  return reflects tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the  published guidance that lists the transaction under paragraph (b)(2) of  this section. A taxpayer also has participated in a listed transaction  if the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the taxpayer's tax  benefits are derived directly or indirectly from tax consequences or a  tax strategy described in published guidance that lists a transaction  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Published guidance may identify  other types or classes of persons that will be treated as participants  in a listed transaction. Published guidance also may identify types or  classes of persons that will not be treated as participants in a listed  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Confidential transactions. A taxpayer has participated in a  confidential transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a tax  benefit from the transaction and the taxpayer's disclosure of the tax  treatment or tax structure of the transaction is limited in the manner  described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If a partnership's, S  corporation's or trust's disclosure is limited, and the partner's,  shareholder's, or beneficiary's disclosure is not limited, then the  partnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder,  or beneficiary, has participated in the confidential transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Transactions with contractual protection. A taxpayer has  participated in a transaction with contractual protection if the  taxpayer's tax return reflects a tax benefit from the transaction and,  as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the taxpayer has the  right to the full or partial refund of fees or the fees are contingent.  If a partnership, S corporation, or trust has the right to a full or  partial refund of fees or has a contingent fee arrangement, and the  partner, shareholder, or beneficiary does not individually have the  right to the refund of fees or a contingent fee arrangement, then the  partnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder,  or beneficiary, has participated in the transaction with contractual  protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>, regardless of whether all or part of the loss  enters into the computation of a net operating loss under section 172 or  net capital loss under section 1212 that the taxpayer may carry back or  carry over to another year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Transactions of interest. A taxpayer has participated in a  transaction of interest if the taxpayer is one of the types or classes  of persons identified as participants in the transaction in the  published guidance describing the transaction of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> only for its first taxable  year with or within which ends the first taxable year of the foreign  corporation in which the foreign corporation participates in the  transaction, and for the reporting shareholder's five succeeding taxable  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting shareholder. The term reporting shareholder means a  United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in a controlled  foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) or a 10 percent  shareholder (by vote or value) of a qualified electing fund (as defined  in section 1295).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Notice 2003-55 (2003-2 CB 395), which modified and  superseded Notice 95-53 (1995-2 CB 334) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this  chapter), describes a lease stripping transaction in which one party  (the transferor) assigns the right to receive future payments under a  lease of tangible property and treats the amount realized from the  assignment as its current income. The transferor later transfers the  property subject to the lease in a transaction intended to qualify as a  transferred basis transaction, for example, a transaction described in  section 351. The transferee corporation claims the deductions associated  with the high basis property subject to the lease. The transferor's and  transferee corporation's tax returns reflect tax positions described in  Notice 2003-55. Therefore, the transferor and transferee corporation  have participated in the listed transaction. In the section 351  transaction, the transferor will have received stock with low value and  high basis from the transferee corporation. If the transferor  subsequently transfers the high basis/low value stock to a taxpayer in  another transaction intended to qualify as a transferred basis  transaction and the taxpayer uses the stock to generate a loss, and if  the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the tax loss claimed was  derived indirectly from the lease stripping transaction, then the  taxpayer has participated in the listed transaction. Accordingly, the  taxpayer must disclose the transaction and the manner of the taxpayer's  participation in the transaction under the rules of this section. For  purposes of this example, if a bank lends money to the transferor,  transferee corporation, or taxpayer for use in their transactions, the  bank has not participated in the listed transaction because the bank's  tax return does not reflect tax consequences or a tax strategy described  in the listing notice (nor does the bank's tax return reflect a tax  benefit derived from tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the  listing notice) nor is the bank described as a participant in the  listing notice.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. XYZ is a limited liability company treated as a  partnership for tax purposes. X, Y, and Z are members of XYZ. X is an  individual, Y is an S corporation, and Z is a partnership. XYZ enters  into a confidential transaction under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  XYZ and X are bound by the confidentiality agreement, but Y and Z are  not bound by the agreement. As a result of the   transaction, XYZ, X, Y, and Z all reflect a tax benefit on their tax  returns. Because XYZ's and X's disclosure of the tax treatment and tax  structure are limited in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of  this section and their tax returns reflect a tax benefit from the  transaction, both XYZ and X have participated in the confidential  transaction. Neither Y nor Z has participated in the confidential  transaction because they are not subject to the confidentiality  agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a corporation, has an 80% partnership interest in PS,  and S, an individual, has a 20% partnership interest in PS. P, S, and PS  are calendar year taxpayers. In 2006, PS enters into a transaction and  incurs a section 165 loss (that does not meet any of the exceptions to a  section 165 loss identified in published guidance) of $12 million and  offsetting gain of $3 million. On PS' 2006 tax return, PS includes the  section 165 loss and the corresponding gain. PS must disclose the  transaction under this section because PS' section 165 loss of $12  million is equal to or greater than $2 million. P is allocated $9.6  million of the section 165 loss and $2.4 million of the offsetting gain.  P does not have to disclose the transaction under this section because  P's section 165 loss of $9.6 million is not equal to or greater than $10  million. S is allocated $2.4 million of the section 165 loss and  $600,000 of the offsetting gain. S must disclose the transaction under  this section because S's section 165 loss of $2.4 million is equal to or  greater than $2 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Notice 2000-44 (2000-2 CB 255) (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), sets forth a listed transaction  involving offsetting options transferred to a partnership where the  taxpayer claims basis in the partnership for the cost of the purchased  options but does not adjust basis under section 752 as a result of the  partnership's assumption of the taxpayer's obligation with respect to  the options. Transactions using short sales, futures, derivatives or any  other type of offsetting obligations to inflate basis in a partnership  interest would be the same as or substantially similar to the  transaction described in Notice 2000-44. Moreover, use of the inflated  basis in the partnership interest to diminish gain that would otherwise  be recognized on the transfer of a partnership asset would also be the  same as or substantially similar to the transaction described in Notice  2000-44. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Notice 2001-16 (2001-1 CB 730) (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), sets forth a listed transaction  involving a seller (X) who desires to sell stock of a corporation (T),  an intermediary corporation (M), and a buyer (Y) who desires to purchase  the assets (and not the stock) of T. M agrees to facilitate the sale to  prevent the recognition of the gain that T would otherwise report.  Notice 2001-16 describes M as a member of a consolidated group that has  a loss within the group or as a party not subject to tax. Transactions  utilizing different intermediaries to prevent the recognition of gain  would be the same as or substantially similar to the transaction  described in Notice 2001-16. An example is a transaction in which M is a  corporation that does not file a consolidated return but which buys T  stock, liquidates T, sells assets of T to Y, and offsets the gain on the  sale of those assets with currently generated losses. See Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tax. The term tax means Federal income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tax benefit. A tax benefit includes deductions, exclusions from  gross income, nonrecognition of gain, tax credits, adjustments (or the  absence of adjustments) to the basis of property, status as an entity  exempt from Federal income taxation, and any other tax consequences that  may reduce a taxpayer's Federal income tax liability   by affecting the amount, timing, character, or source of any item of  income, gain, expense, loss, or credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Tax return. The term tax return means a Federal income tax  return and a Federal information return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Tax treatment. The tax treatment of a transaction is the  purported or claimed Federal income tax treatment of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Tax structure. The tax structure of a transaction is any fact  that may be relevant to understanding the purported or claimed Federal  income tax treatment of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time of providing disclosure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The disclosure  statement for a reportable transaction must be attached to the  taxpayer's tax return for each taxable year for which a taxpayer  participates in a reportable transaction. In addition, a disclosure  statement for a reportable transaction must be attached to each amended  return that reflects a taxpayer's participation in a reportable  transaction. A copy of the disclosure statement must be sent to OTSA at  the same time that any disclosure statement is first filed by the  taxpayer pertaining to a particular reportable transaction. If a  reportable transaction results in a loss which is carried back to a  prior year, the disclosure statement for the reportable transaction must  be attached to the taxpayer's application for tentative refund or  amended tax return for that prior year. In the case of a taxpayer that  is a partnership, an S corporation, or a trust, the disclosure statement  for a reportable transaction must be attached to the partnership, S  corporation, or trust's tax return for each taxable year in which the  partnership, S corporation, or trust participates in the transaction  under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. If a taxpayer  who is a partner in a partnership, a shareholder in an S corporation, or  a beneficiary of a trust receives a timely Schedule K-1 less than 10  calendar days before the due date of the taxpayer's return (including  extensions) and, based on receipt of the timely Schedule K-1, the  taxpayer determines that the taxpayer participated in a reportable  transaction within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the  disclosure statement will not be considered late if the taxpayer  discloses the reportable transaction by filing a disclosure statement  with OTSA within 60 calendar days after the due date of the taxpayer's  return (including extensions). The Commissioner in his discretion may  issue in published guidance other provisions for disclosure under Sec.  1.6011-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Listed transactions and transactions of  interest. In general,   if a transaction becomes a listed transaction or a transaction of  interest after the filing of a taxpayer's tax return (including an  amended return) reflecting the taxpayer's participation in the listed  transaction or transaction of interest and before the end of the period  of limitations for assessment of tax for any taxable year in which the  taxpayer participated in the listed transaction or transaction of  interest, then a disclosure statement must be filed, regardless of  whether the taxpayer participated in the transaction in the year the  transaction became a listed transaction or a transaction of interest,  with OTSA within 90 calendar days after the date on which the  transaction became a listed transaction or a transaction of interest.  The Commissioner also may determine the time for disclosure of listed  transactions and transactions of interest in the published guidance  identifying the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loss transactions. If a transaction becomes a loss transaction  because the losses equal or exceed the threshold amounts as described in  paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, a disclosure statement must be  filed as an attachment to the taxpayer's tax return for the first  taxable year in which the threshold amount is reached and to any  subsequent tax return that reflects any amount of section 165 loss from  the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiple disclosures. The taxpayer must disclose the transaction  in the time and manner provided for under the provisions of this section  regardless of whether the taxpayer also plans to disclose the  transaction under other published guidance, for example, Sec. 1.6662- 3(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0">Example. In January of 2008, F, a calendar year taxpayer, enters  into a transaction that at the time is not a listed transaction and is  not a transaction described in any of the paragraphs (b)(3) through (7)  of this section. All the tax benefits from the transaction are reported  on F's 2008 tax return filed timely in April 2009. On May 2, 2011, the  IRS publishes a notice identifying the transaction as a listed  transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Upon issuance  of the May 2, 2011 notice, the transaction becomes a reportable  transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section. The period of  limitations on assessment for F's 2008 taxable year is still open. F is  required to file Form 8886 for the transaction with OTSA within 90  calendar days after May 2, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rulings and protective disclosures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rulings. If a taxpayer  requests a ruling on the merits of a specific transaction on or before  the date that disclosure would otherwise be required under this section,  and receives a favorable ruling as to the transaction, the disclosure  rules under this section will be deemed to have been satisfied by that  taxpayer with regard to that transaction, so long as the request fully  discloses all relevant facts relating to the transaction which would  otherwise be required to be disclosed under this section. If a taxpayer  requests a ruling as to whether a specific transaction is a reportable  transaction on or before the date that disclosure would otherwise be  required under this section, the Commissioner in his discretion may  determine that the submission satisfies the disclosure rules under this  section for the taxpayer requesting the ruling for that transaction if  the request fully discloses all relevant facts relating to the  transaction which would otherwise be required to be disclosed under this  section. The potential obligation of the taxpayer to disclose the  transaction under this section will not be suspended during the period  that the ruling request is pending.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protective disclosures. If a taxpayer is uncertain whether a  transaction must be disclosed under this section, the taxpayer may  disclose the transaction in accordance with the requirements of this  section and comply with all the provisions of this section, and indicate  on the disclosure statement that the disclosure statement is being filed  on a protective basis. The IRS will not treat disclosure statements  filed on a protective basis any differently than other disclosure  statements filed under this section. For a protective disclosure to be  effective, the taxpayer must comply with these disclosure regulations by  providing to the IRS all information requested by the IRS under this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Retention of documents. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with the instructions  to Form   8886 (or a successor form), the taxpayer must retain a copy of all  documents and other records related to a transaction subject to  disclosure under this section that are material to an understanding of  the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction.
