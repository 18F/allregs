                            <p class="depth0">Manufacturers may generate credits applicable to the CO2 fleet average program described in Sec. 86.1865-12 by implementing specific air conditioning system technologies designed to reduce air conditioning refrigerant leakage over the useful life of their passenger automobiles and/or light trucks. Credits shall be calculated according to this section for each air conditioning system that the manufacturer is using to generate CO2 credits. Manufacturers may also generate early air conditioning refrigerant leakage credits under this section for the 2009 through 2011 model years according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1871-12(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer shall calculate an annual rate of refrigerant leakage from an air conditioning system in grams per year according to the procedures specified in SAE J2727 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 86.1). In doing so, the refrigerant permeation rates for

hoses shall be determined using the procedures specified in SAE J2064 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 86.1) The annual rate of refrigerant leakage from an air conditioning system shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per year. The procedures of SAE J2727 may be used to determine leakage rates for HFC-134a and HFO-1234yf; manufacturers should contact EPA regarding procedures for other refrigerants. The annual rate of refrigerant leakage from an air conditioning system shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The CO2-equivalent gram per mile leakage reduction used to calculate the total leakage credits generated by an air conditioning system shall be determined according to this paragraph (b), separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks, and rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Passenger automobile leakage credit for an air conditioning system:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC12.038

If the calculated rate is less than 8.3 grams/year (or 4.1 grams/year for systems using only electric compressors), the rate for the purpose of this formula shall be 8.3 grams/year (or 4.1 grams/year for systems using only electric compressors).</p><p class="depth0">GWPREF means the global warming potential of the refrigerant as indicated in paragraph (e) of this section or as otherwise determined by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth0">HiLeakDis means the high leak disincentive, which is zero for model years 2012 through 2016, and for 2017 and later model years is determined using the following equation, except that if GWPREF is greater than 150 or if the calculated result of the equation is less than zero, HiLeakDis shall be set equal to zero, or if the calculated result of the equation is greater than 1.8 g/mi, HiLeakDis shall be set to 1.8 g/mi:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC12.039
