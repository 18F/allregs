                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims arising from the acts or omissions of the U.S. Armed  Forces in the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia are  settled in accordance with Art. XV, Non-contractual Claims, of the U.S.- Marshall Islands and Micronesian Status of Forces Agreement (the  ``SOFA'') (posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see Sec.  536.2(a)). This is pursuant to the ``agreed upon minutes'' that are  appended to the SOFA, pursuant to Section 323 of the Compact of Free  Association between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands and the Federated  States of Micronesia, enacted by Public Law 99-239, January 14, 1986.  (The Compact may be viewed at http://www.fm/jcn/compact/relindex.html).  The ``agreed upon minutes'' state that ``all claims within the scope of  paragraph 1 of Article XV [Claims], [of the Compact] * * * shall be  processed and settled exclusively pursuant to the Foreign Claims Act, 10  U.S.C. 2734, and any regulations promulgated in implementation  thereof.'' Therefore, Title I, Article 178 of the Compact, regarding  claims processing, is not applicable to claims arising from the acts or  omissions of the U.S. armed forces, but only to other federal agencies.  Those agencies are required to follow the provisions of the Federal Tort  Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 2672.</p>
