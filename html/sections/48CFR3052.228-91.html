However, the Government may retain the damaged aircraft or dispose of it as it wishes. In that event, the Contractor will be paid the fair market value of the aircraft as stated in the clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor agrees that the contract price does not include any cost attributable to hull insurance or to any reserve fund it has established to protect its interest in the aircraft. If, in the event of loss or damage to the leased aircraft, the Contractor receives compensation for such loss or damage in any form from any source, the amount of such compensation shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credited to the Government in determining the amount of the Government's liability; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an increment of value of the aircraft beyond the value for which the Government is responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event of loss of or damage to the aircraft, the Government shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery by the Contractor against third parties for such loss or damage and the Contractor shall promptly assign such rights in writing to the Government.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
