                            <p class="depth0">Power supplies and CPU boards used with personal computers and for  which separate authorizations are required to be obtained shall be  tested as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CPU boards shall be tested as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testing for radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU  board installed in a typical enclosure but with the enclosure's cover  removed so that the internal circuitry is exposed at the top and on at  least two sides. Additional components, including a power supply,  peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to  result in a complete personal computer system. If the oscillator and the  microprocessor circuits are contained on separate circuit boards, both  boards, typical of the combination that would normally be employed, must  be used in the test. Testing shall be in accordance with the procedures  specified in Sec. 15.31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under these test conditions, the system under test shall not  exceed the radiated emission limits specified in Sec. 15.109 by more  than 6 dB. Emissions greater than 6 dB that can be identified and  documented to originate from a component(s) other than the CPU board  being tested, may be dismissed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless the test in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section  demonstrates compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109, a second test  shall be performed using the same configuration described above but with  the cover installed on the enclosure. Testing shall be in accordance  with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under these test  conditions, the system under test shall not exceed the radiated emission  limits specified in Sec. 15.109.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of the procedure in (a)(1) of this section, CPU boards  may be tested to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109  using a specified enclosure with the cover installed. Testing for  radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU board installed in a  typical system configuration. Additional components, including a power  supply, peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as  needed, to result in a complete personal computer system. If the  oscillator and the microprocessor circuits are contained on separate  circuit boards, both boards, typical of the combination that would  normally be employed, must be used in the test. Testing shall be in  accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under this  procedure, CPU boards that comply with the limits in Sec. 15.109 must be  marketed together with the specific enclosure used for the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The test demonstrating compliance with the AC power line  conducted limits specified in Sec. 15.107 shall be performed in  accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 using an  enclosure, peripherals, power supply and subassemblies that are typical  of the type with which the CPU board under test would normally be  employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The power supply shall be tested installed in an enclosure that  is typical of the type within which it would normally be installed.  Additional components, including peripheral devices, a   CPU board, and subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to result in a  complete personal computer system. Testing shall be in accordance with  the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 and must demonstrate compliance  with all of the standards contained in this part.
