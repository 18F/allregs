                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section are applicable to all persons  whose debt to CCC becomes delinquent after January 1, 1990, unless the  debtor and CCC agree otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not  apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local  governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged in  accordance with applicable statutes or, if none are applicable, at the  rate of interest charged by the U.S. Treasury for funds borrowed by CCC  on the day the debt became delinquent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement or contract  either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest  or charges applicable to the debt involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the late payment interest is waived by CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CCC will assess late payment interest on the full amount of  delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount  of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued regular  loan interest or accrued program interest, and any other charges which  are otherwise due and owing to CCC on the delinquent debt at the time  the late payment interest is assessed, except as provided in paragraphs  (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate  of interest which CCC charges on delinquent debts. The late payment  interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's  current value of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the  Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs  (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract or  other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and  payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of  the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise  provided by statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation,  contract or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment  interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to  accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or  hand-delivered to the debtor, except that, with respect to debts  resulting from price support loans, late payment interest shall begin to  accrue from the date on which a claim is established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be  fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has  defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new  agreement. CCC may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the  late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is  executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under  the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid  under a new repayment agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a  daily basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this  section, an additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will  be assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid 90 days after  the date described in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (d)(2) of this section, if no  repayment schedule satisfactory to CCC has been agreed upon. Such rate  will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began  to accrue and apply on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue  until the delinquent debt has been paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to debts resulting from price support loans, an  additional interest rate of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed  on a portion of a debt which remains unpaid 60 days after the date on  which a claim was established. Such rate will be assessed   retroactively from the date of claim establishment and apply on a daily  basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has  been paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> CCC shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs  of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such  costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are  not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of  employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing  contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or  property to satisfy the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments  will be applied first to administrative charges, second to additional  interest assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and  late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.
