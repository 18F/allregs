                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are  used to determine the conformity of motorcycles with the standards set  forth in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling,  parking, and operating conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The exhaust emission test is designed to determine hydrocarbon  (gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled  motorcycles), methanol, formaldehyde, and hydrocarbon (methanol-fueled  motorcycles), carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen mass emissions  while simulating an average trip in an urban area. The test consists of  engine startups and motorcycle operation on a chassis dynamometer,  through a specified driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted  exhaust emissions is collected continuously for subsequent analysis,  using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all  emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new  motorcycle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart.  Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be  authorized in accordance with subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Background concentrations are measured for all species for which  emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires  sampling and analysis of the dilution air. (When testing methanol-fueled  motorcycles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background  concentrations of methanol and/or formaldehyde, and then assume that the  concentrations are zero during calculations.)
