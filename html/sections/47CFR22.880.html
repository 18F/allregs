                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior notification. Public safety/CII licensees may notify a commercial aviation air-ground system licensee that they wish to receive prior notification of the activation or modification of a commercial aviation air-ground system ground station site in their area. Thereafter, the commercial aviation air-ground system licensee must provide the following information to the public safety/CII licensee at least 10 business days before a new ground station is activated or an existing ground station is modified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective radiated power;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Antenna manufacturer, model number, height above ground level and up tilt angle, as installed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Channels available for use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose of prior notification. The prior notification of ground station activation or modification is for informational purposes only: public safety/CII licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed ground station or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of prior notification are to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allow a public safety licensee to advise the commercial aviation air-ground system licensee whether it believes a proposed ground station will generate unacceptable interference;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit commercial aviation air-ground system licensee(s) to make voluntary changes in ground station parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the ground station is activated.
