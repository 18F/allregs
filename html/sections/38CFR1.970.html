Sec.   1.930 through 1.936. In loan guaranty cases the offer of a veteran or  other obligor to effect a   compromise must relate to an indebtedness established after the  liquidation of the security, if any, and shall be reviewed by the  Committee. An offer to effect a compromise may be accepted if it is  deemed advantageous to the Government. A decision on an offer of  compromise may be revised or modified on the basis of any information  which would warrant a change in the original decision.
