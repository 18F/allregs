                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required assessment. Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c),  and (d) of this section, each application for a new active ingredient,  new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of  administration shall contain data that are adequate to assess the safety  and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all  relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and  administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is  safe and effective. Where the course of the disease and the effects of  the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, FDA  may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from  adequate and well-controlled studies in adults usually supplemented with  other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as  pharmacokinetic studies. Studies may not be needed in each pediatric age  group, if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another.  Assessments of safety and effectiveness required under this section for  a drug product that represents a meaningful therapeutic benefit over  existing treatments for pediatric patients must be carried out using  appropriate formulations for each age group(s) for which the assessment  is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deferred submission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FDA may, on its own initiative or at  the request of an applicant, defer submission of some or all assessments  of safety and effectiveness described in paragraph (a) of this section  until after approval of the drug product for use in adults. Deferral may  be granted if, among other reasons, the drug is ready for approval in  adults before studies in pediatric patients are complete, or pediatric  studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data  have been collected. If an applicant requests deferred submission, the  request must provide a certification from the applicant of the grounds  for delaying pediatric studies, a description of the   planned or ongoing studies, and evidence that the studies are being or  will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If FDA determines that there is an adequate justification for  temporarily delaying the submission of assessments of pediatric safety  and effectiveness, the drug product may be approved for use in adults  subject to the requirement that the applicant submit the required  assessments within a specified time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. FDA may grant a full or partial waiver of  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section on its own initiative  or at the request of an applicant. A request for a waiver must provide  an adequate justification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Full waiver. An applicant may request a waiver of the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the applicant certifies  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The drug product does not represent a meaningful therapeutic  benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients and is not  likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because,  e.g., the number of such patients is so small or geographically  dispersed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug product  would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partial waiver. An applicant may request a waiver of the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a  specified pediatric age group, if the applicant certifies that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The drug product does not represent a meaningful therapeutic  benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients in that age  group, and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of patients  in that age group;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because,  e.g., the number of patients in that age group is so small or  geographically dispersed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug product  would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to  produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have  failed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FDA action on waiver. FDA shall grant a full or partial waiver,  as appropriate, if the agency finds that there is a reasonable basis on  which to conclude that one or more of the grounds for waiver specified  in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section have been met. If a  waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a  pediatric formulation, the waiver will cover only those pediatric age  groups requiring that formulation. If a waiver is granted because there  is evidence that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric  populations, this information will be included in the product's  labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Definition of ``meaningful therapeutic benefit''. For purposes  of this section and Sec. 201.23 of this chapter, a drug will be  considered to offer a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing  therapies if FDA estimates that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If approved, the drug would represent a significant improvement  in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, compared to  marketed products adequately labeled for that use in the relevant  pediatric population. Examples of how improvement might be demonstrated  include, for example, evidence of increased effectiveness in treatment,  prevention, or diagnosis of disease, elimination or substantial  reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement  of compliance, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new  subpopulation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The drug is in a class of drugs or for an indication for which  there is a need for additional therapeutic options.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemption for orphan drugs. This section does not apply to any  drug for an indication or indications for which orphan designation has  been granted under part 316, subpart C, of this chapter.  [63 FR 66670, Dec. 2, 1998]</p>
