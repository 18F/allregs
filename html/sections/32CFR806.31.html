                                Sec. 806.31  Requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) to submitters of nongovernment  contract-related information.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FOIA requires federal agencies to provide their records,  except those specifically exempted, for the public to inspect and copy.  Section (b) of the Act lists nine exemptions that are the only basis for  withholding records from the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em>, may  apply to records or information the Air Force maintains. Under this  exemption, agencies must withhold trade secrets and commercial or  financial information they obtained from a person or organization  outside the government that is privileged or confidential. This  generally includes information provided and received during the  contracting process with the understanding that the Air Force will keep  it privileged or confidential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commercial or financial matter is ``confidential'' and exempt if  its release will probably:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Impair the government's ability to obtain necessary information  in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantially harm the source's competitive position or impair  some other legitimate government interest such as compliance and program  effectiveness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability of exemption. The exemption may be used to protect  information provided by a nongovernment submitter when public disclosure  will probably cause substantial harm to its competitive position.  Examples of information that may qualify for this exemption include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial or financial information received in confidence with  loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well as other information  received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions,  discoveries, or other proprietary data.</p><p class="depth3">Note: Certain proprietary and source selection information may also  fall under exemption (b)(3), under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2305(g)  or 41 U.S.C. 423, if statutory requirements are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statistical data and commercial or financial information  concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and  expenditures, offered and received in confidence from a contractor or  potential contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or  audits, received and kept in confidence because they reveal trade  secrets or commercial or financial information, normally considered  confidential or privileged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial data that private employers give in confidence for  local wage surveys used to set and adjust pay schedules for the  prevailing wage rate of DoD employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or  developments that is technical or scientific or other information  submitted with a research grant application, or with a report while  research is in progress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor  develops entirely at private expense, and technical or scientific data  developed partly with Federal funds and partly with private funds, in  which the contractor or subcontractor retains legitimate proprietary  interests per 10 U.S.C. 2320 to 2321 and 48 CFR, Chapter 2, 227.71- 227.72.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976  (17 U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely impact its  potential market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submitter's Written Response. If release of the requested  material would prejudice your commercial interests, give detailed  written reasons that identify the specific information and the  competitive harm public release will cause to you, your organization, or  your business. The act requires the Air Force to provide any reasonably  segregable part of a record after deleting exempt portions. If deleting  key words or phrases would adequately protect your interests, advise us  in writing which portions you believe we can safely release, and which  portions you believe we need to withhold from release. If you do not  provide details on the probability of substantial harm to your  competitive position or other commercial interests, which would be  caused by releasing your material to the requester, we may be required  to release the information. Records qualify for protection on a case by  case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pricing Information. Generally, the prices a contractor charges  the government for goods or services would be released under the FOIA.  Examples of releasable data include: bids submitted in response to an  invitation for bids (IFB), amounts actually paid by the government under  a contract, and line item prices, contract award price, and  modifications to a contract. Unit prices contained in a contract award  are considered releasable as part of the post award notification  procedure prescribed by 48 CFR 15.503, unless they are part of an  unsuccessful proposal, then 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) protects everything  including unit price.</p><p class="depth2">Sec.
