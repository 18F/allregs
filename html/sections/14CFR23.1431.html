If the airplane design includes provision for the use of communication  headsets, the evaluation must also consider conditions where headsets  are being used. If the evaluation shows conditions under which it will  be difficult to converse, an intercommunication system must be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If installed communication equipment includes transmitter ``off- on'' switching, that switching means must be designed to return from the  ``transmit'' to the ``off'' position when it is released and ensure that  the transmitter will return to the off (non transmitting) state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If provisions for the use of communication headsets are  provided, it must be demonstrated that the flightcrew members will  receive all aural warnings under the actual cockpit noise conditions  when the airplane is being operated when any headset is being used.
