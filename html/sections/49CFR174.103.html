                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials found damaged or  broken in transit may be repaired when practicable and not dangerous. A  broken box of Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials that cannot be  repaired must be reinforced by stout wrapping paper and twine, placed in  another strong box and surrounded by dry, fine sawdust or dry and clean  cotton waste or elastic wads made from dry newspapers. A ruptured can or  keg must be sealed and enclosed in a strong cloth bag of good quality  and boxed. Damaged packages thus protected and properly marked may be  forwarded. The box and waybill   must be marked to indicate that it has been repacked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Care must be exercised in repacking damaged containers so that  no spark is produced by contact of metal or other hard surfaces which  could ignite loose particles of explosive compositions that may be  strewn on car floors or freight. In addition, the car floors must be  thoroughly swept, and washed with a plentiful supply of water. Iron- wheel trucks, metal hammers, or other metal tools that may produce  sparks may not be used. Metal tools must be limited to those made of  brass, bronze, or copper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each package of Class 1 (explosive) materials showing evidence  of leakage of liquid ingredients must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be refused if leakage is discovered before acceptance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be disposed of to a person who is competent and willing to  remove them from the carrier's property, if the leakage is discovered  while the shipment is in transit; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be removed immediately by consignee, if the leakage is  discovered at the shipment's destination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the disposition required by paragraph (c) of this section  cannot be made, the leaking package must be packed in other boxes large  enough to permit enclosure and the leaking boxes must be surrounded by  at least 5 cm (2 inches) of dry, fine sawdust or dry and clean cotton  waste, and be stored in a station magazine or other safe place until the  arrival of an inspector of the Bureau of Explosives, or other authorized  person, to superintend the destruction or disposition of the condemned  material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If careful inspection shows that an astray shipment of Class 1  (explosive) materials is in proper condition for safe transportation, it  must be forwarded immediately to its destination if known, or returned  to the shipper by the most practicable route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a package in an astray shipment is not in proper condition  for safe transportation (see paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this  section), or when the name and address of the consignee and the shipper  are unknown, disposition must be made as prescribed by paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section.
