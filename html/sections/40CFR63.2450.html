                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), and you must meet the requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.2455 through 63.2490 (or the alternative means of compliance in Sec. 63.2495, Sec. 63.2500, or Sec. 63.2505), except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (s) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.2515, 63.2520, and 63.2525.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine halogenated vent streams. You must determine if an emission stream is a halogenated vent stream, as defined in Sec. 63.2550, by calculating the mass emission rate of halogen atoms in accordance with Sec. 63.115(d)(2)(v). Alternatively, you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for combined emission streams. When organic HAP emissions from different emission types (e.g., continuous process vents, batch process vents, storage tanks, transfer operations, and waste management units) are combined, you must comply with the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart for each kind of organic HAP emissions in the stream (e.g., the requirements of table 1 to this subpart for continuous process vents and the requirements of table 4 to this subpart for emissions from storage tanks).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the applicable requirements based on the hierarchy presented in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section. For a combined stream, the applicable requirements are specified in the highest-listed paragraph in the hierarchy that applies to any of the individual streams that make up the combined stream. For example, if a combined stream consists of emissions from Group 1 batch process vents and any other type of emission stream, then you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the combined stream; compliance with the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section constitutes compliance for the other emission streams in the combined stream. Two exceptions are that you must comply with the requirements in table 3 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2465 for all process vents with hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions, and recordkeeping requirements for Group 2 applicability or compliance are still required (e.g., the requirement in Sec. 63.2525(f) to track the number of batches produced and calculate rolling annual emissions for processes with Group 2 batch process vents).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of table 2 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2460 for Group 1 batch process vents, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of table 1 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2455 for continuous process vents that are routed to a control device, as defined in Sec. 63.981, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The requirements of table 5 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2475 for transfer operations, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The requirements of table 7 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2485 for emissions from waste management units that are used to manage and treat Group 1 wastewater streams and residuals from Group 1 wastewater streams, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The requirements of table 4 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2470 for control of emissions from storage tanks, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The requirements of table 1 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2455 for continuous process vents after a recovery device including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements for control devices. (1) Except when complying with Sec. 63.2485, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare) or recovery devices, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except when complying with Sec. 63.2485, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare) or recovery devices, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except when complying with Sec. 63.2485, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions from halogenated vent streams, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in Sec. 63.115(d)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for flare compliance assessments. (1) As part of a flare compliance assessment required in Sec. 63.987(b), you have the option of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b) by complying with the requirements in either Sec. 63.11(b)(6)(i) or Sec. 63.987(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As part of a flare compliance assessment required in Sec. 63.987(b), you have the option of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b) by complying with the requirements in either Sec. 63.11(b)(6)(i) or Sec. 63.987(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you elect to meet the requirements in Sec. 63.11(b)(6)(i), you must keep flare compliance assessment records as specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Keep records as specified in Sec. 63.998(a)(1)(i), except that a record of the heat content determination is not required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Keep records of the flare diameter, hydrogen content, exit velocity, and maximum permitted velocity. Include these records in the flare compliance report required in Sec. 63.999(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requirements for performance tests. The requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section apply instead of or in addition to the requirements specified in subpart SS of this part 63.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct gas molecular weight analysis using Method 3, 3A, or 3B in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains carbon disulfide, you must conduct emissions testing according to paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you elect to comply with the percent reduction emission limits in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, and carbon disulfide is the principal organic HAP component (i.e., greater than 50 percent of the HAP in the stream by volume), then you must use Method 18, or Method 15 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to measure carbon disulfide at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Use the percent reduction in carbon disulfide as a surrogate for the percent reduction in total organic HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you elect to comply with the outlet total organic compound (TOC) concentration emission limits in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, and the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains greater than 10 percent (volume concentration) carbon disulfide, you must use Method 18 or Method 15 to separately determine the carbon disulfide concentration. Calculate the total HAP or TOC emissions by totaling the carbon disulfide emissions measured using Method 18 or 15

and the other HAP emissions measured using Method 18 or 25A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission limits specified in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, you may use Method 320 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Section 63.997(c)(1) does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 150 days after the compliance date, as specified in Sec. 63.2520(d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Design evaluation. To determine the percent reduction of a small control device that is used to comply with an emission limit specified in table 1, 2, 3, or 5 to this subpart, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as specified in subpart SS of this part 63. You must establish the value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design evaluation. For continuous process vents, the design evaluation must be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process, unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For transfer racks, the design evaluation must demonstrate that the control device achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum transfer loading rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Outlet concentration correction for combustion devices. When Sec. 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, the requirements in either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section apply for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must correct the concentration in the gas stream at the outlet of the combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental gases, as defined in Sec. 63.2550, to the vent stream, or;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must correct the measured concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.2460; you may use process knowledge and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Continuous emissions monitoring systems.

For any CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8, you must also comply with appendix F, procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you wish to use a CEMS other than an Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 to measure hydrogen halide and halogen HAP before we promulgate a Performance Specification for such CEMS, you must prepare a monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 63.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the calibration gases and reporting units for TOC CEMS in accordance with paragraph (j)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 9 or 15 requirements, determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a combustion device, calibrate the instrument on the predominant organic HAP and report the results as carbon (C1), and use Method 25A or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a noncombustion device,

determine the predominant organic HAP using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C1. Use Method 18, ASTM D6420-99, or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as C1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except that the schedule in Sec. 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the results of the performance evaluation must be included in the notification of compliance status report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data consistent with the data availability requirements specified in Sec. 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through (D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations within a process. Operating block averages may be used only for batch process vent data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you add supplemental gases, you must correct the measured concentrations in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section and Sec. 63.2460(c)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Continuous parameter monitoring.

Sec. 63.994(c)(1)(i) and 63.998(a)(2)(ii)(D), you may elect to continuously monitor and record the caustic strength of the effluent. For halogen scrubbers used to control only batch process vents you may elect to monitor and record either the pH or the caustic strength of the scrubber effluent at least once per day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an alternative to the inlet and outlet temperature monitoring requirements for catalytic incinerators as specified in Sec. 63.988(c)(2) and the related recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. 63.998(a)(2)(ii)(B)(2) and (c)(2)(ii), you may elect to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (k)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitor and record the inlet temperature as specified in subpart SS of this part 63.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Check the activity level of the catalyst at least every 12 months and take any necessary corrective action, such as replacing the catalyst to ensure that the catalyst is performing as designed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain records of the annual checks of catalyst activity levels and the subsequent corrective actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Recording the downstream temperature and temperature difference across the catalyst bed as specified in Sec. 63.998(a)(2)(ii)(B)(2) and (b)(2)(ii) is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For absorbers that control organic compounds and use water as the scrubbing fluid, you must conduct monitoring and recordkeeping as specified in paragraphs (k)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section instead of the monitoring and recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec.

limit(s) for a parameter(s) that you will measure and record at least once per averaging period (i.e., daily or block) to verify that the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Sections 63.152(f)(7)(ii) through (iv) and 63.998(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data collected during periods of SSM from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Reporting.
