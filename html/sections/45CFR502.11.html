                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrative Officer or any employee acting in that  official's capacity will determine within twenty days (excepting  Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any  a request whether to comply with the request. Upon receipt of a request  for a Commission record which is available, the Administrative Officer  or other employee will notify the requester as to the time the record is  available, and will promptly make the record available after advising  the requester of the applicable fees under Sec. 502.13. The person  making the request will be notified immediately after any adverse  determination, the reasons for making the adverse determination and the  right of the person to appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any denial of a request for a record will be written and signed  by the Administrative Officer or other employee, including a statement  of the reason for denial. That statement will contain, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of  Information Act authorizing the withholding of a record, and to the  extent consistent with the purpose of the exemption, an explanation of  how the exemption applies to the record withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a record requested does not exist, or has been legally  disposed of, the requester will be so notified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in paragraph  (a) of this section may be extended by written notice to the person  making the request setting forth the reasons for the extension and the  date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No extension  notice will specify a date that would result in an extension for more  than twenty working days. As used in this paragraph, ``unusual  circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to  the proper processing of the particular request--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  other establishments that are separate from the office processing the  request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in  the determination of the request or among two or more components of the  agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</p>
