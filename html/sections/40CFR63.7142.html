                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you wish to claim that your LMP is an area source, you must measure the emissions of hydrogen chloride from all lime kilns, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at your plant using either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EPA Method 320 of appendix A to this part,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA Method 321 of appendix A to this part, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ASTM Method D6735-01, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Gaseous Chlorides and Fluorides from Mineral Calcining Exhaust Sources--Impinger Method, provided that the provisions in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section are followed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A test must include three or more runs in which a pair of samples is obtained simultaneously for each run according to section 11.2.6 of ASTM Method D6735-01.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must calculate the test run standard deviation of each set of paired samples to quantify data precision, according to Equation 1 of this section:

If the percent recovery is outside of this range, the data are considered invalid, and the test must be repeated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you conduct tests to determine the rates of emission of specific organic HAP from lime kilns at LMP for use in applicability determinations under Sec. 63.7081, you may use either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 320 of appendix A to this part, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 18 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ASTM D6420-99, Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), provided that the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section are followed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The target compound(s) are those listed in section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 parts per million by volume;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, the additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, is conducted, met, documented, and submitted with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the compound is not considered water soluble; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, ASTM D6420-99 may not be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is left to the discretion of the permitting authority whether or not idled kilns must be tested for (HCl) to claim area source status. If the facility has kilns that use common feed materials and fuel, are essentially identical in design, and use essentially identical emission controls, the permitting authority may also determine if one kiln can be tested, and the HCl emissions for the other essentially identical kilns be estimated from that test.</p>
