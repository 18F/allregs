                                Sec. 49.4261-3  Payments made within the United States.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> applies to payments  made within the United States for transportation which begins in the  United States or in the 225-mile zone and ends in the United States or  in the 225-mile zone. For example, an amount paid within the United  States for transportation between New York and Montreal, Canada; between  Vancouver, Canada, and Windsor, Canada; or between Nogales, Mexico, and  Hermosillo, Mexico, would be fully taxable. See section 4262(c) (2) and  paragraph (b) of Sec. 49.4262(c)-1 for the definition of the term  ``225-mile zone''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other transportation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transportation beginning before  November 16, 1962. In the case of transportation beginning before  November 15, 1962, (other than that described in paragraph (a) of this  section), for which payment is made in the United States, the tax  applies with respect to the amount paid for that portion of such  transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station  in the United States to another port or station in the United States.  Transportation that (i) begins in the United States or in the 225-mile  zone and ends outside such area, (ii) begins outside the United States  or the 225-mile zone and ends inside such area, or (iii) begins outside  the United States and ends outside such area is taxable only with  respect to such portion of the transportation which is directly or  indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another such  port or station. Thus, on a trip from Chicago to London, England, with a  stopover at New York, for which payment is made in the United States,  the tax would apply to the part of the payment which is applicable to  the transportation from Chicago to New York.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation beginning after November 15, 1962. In the case of  transportation beginning after November 15, 1962 (other than that  described in paragraph (a) of this section), for which payment is made  in the United States, the tax applies with respect to the amount paid  for that portion of such transportation by air which is directly or  indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port  or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part  of ``uninterrupted international air transportation'' within the meaning  of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 49.4262(c)-1.  Transportation that</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Begins in the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends  outside such area,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Begins outside the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends  inside such area, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Begins outside the United States and ends outside such area.  is taxable only with respect to such portion of the transportation by  air which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the  United States to another port or station in the United States, but only  if such portion is not a part of ``uninterrupted international air  transportation'' within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph  (c) of Sec. 49.4262(c)-1. Thus, on a trip by air from Chicago to  London, England, with a stopover at New York, for which payment is made  in the United States, if the portion from Chicago to New York is not a  part of ``uninterrupted international air transportation'' within the  meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 49.4262(c)-1,  the tax would apply to the part of the payment which is applicable to  the transportation from Chicago to New York. However, if the portion  from Chicago to New York is a part of ``uninterrupted international air  transportation'' within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph  (c) of Sec. 49.4262(c)-1, the tax would not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method of computing tax on taxable portion. Where a payment is  made for transportation which is partially taxable under paragraph (b)  of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tax may be computed on that proportin of the total amount  paid   which the mileage of the taxable portion of the transportation bears to  the mileage of the entire trip, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tax may be computed on the basis of the applicable local  fare for transportation of a like class between the ports or stations  referred to in paragraph (b) of this section. Where a uniform fare is  charge for transportation between a station and any coastal gateway  point of embarkation on a trip to the same international destination,  the tax may be computed on the basis of such uniform fare. In the  absence of a fare described in this subparagraph, the tax must be  determined in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If an  international trip includes a leg between coastal gateway points of  embarkation for which no additional fare is charged, no tax shall be  applicable to such leg of the transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cross reference.
