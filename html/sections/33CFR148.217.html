However, a State not named as an Adjacent Coastal State in the notice may request to be designated as one if the environmental risks to it are equal to or greater than the risks posed to a State directly connected by pipeline to the proposed deepwater port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be submitted in writing to the Commandant (CG-5P) within 14 days after the date of publication of the notice of application in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be signed by the Governor of the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> List the facts and any available documentation or analyses concerning the risk of damage to the coastal environment of the State; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Explain why the State believes the risk of damage to its coastal environment is equal to or greater than the risk to a State connected by a pipeline to the proposed deepwater port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of a request, the Commandant (CG-5P) will send a copy of the State's request to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and ask for the Administrator's recommendations within an amount of time that will allow the Commandant (CG-5P) and the MARAD Administrator 45 days from receipt of the request to determine the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If after receiving NOAA's recommendations the Commandant (CG-5P), in concurrence with MARAD Administrator, determines that the State should be considered an Adjacent

Coastal State, the Commandant (CG-5P), in concurrence with the MARAD Administrator, will so designate it. If the Commandant (CG-5P), in concurrence with the MARAD Administrator, denies the request, he or she will notify the requesting State's Governor of the denial.
