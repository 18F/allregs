This authority is applicable to property under the jurisdiction or control of the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force. The authority vested in the President by this law has been delegated to the Office of Management and Budget by Executive Order No. 10530 dated 11 May 1954, as amended (see footnote to 3 U.S.C. 301).</p>
