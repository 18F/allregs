                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. This section is intended to meet  testing requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15  U.S.C. 2601).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test  guideline is the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances  (OPPTS) harmonized test guideline 870.3050 (July 2000, final  guidelines). This source is available at the address in paragraph (h) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic  characteristics of a chemical, the determination of oral toxicity using  repeated doses may be carried out after initial information on toxicity  has been obtained by acute testing. This study provides information on  the possible health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure over  a relatively limited period of time. The method comprises the basic  repeated dose toxicity study that may be used for chemicals on which a  90-day study is not warranted (e.g., when the production volume does not  exceed certain limits) or as a preliminary to a long term study. The  duration of exposure should normally be 28 days although a 14-day study  may be appropriate in certain circumstances; justification for use of a  14-day exposure period should be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This section places emphasis on neurological effects as a  specific endpoint, and the need for careful clinical observations of the  animals, so as to obtain as much information as possible, is stressed.  The method should identify chemicals with neurotoxic potential, which  may warrant further in-depth investigation of this aspect. In addition,  the method may give an indication of immunological effects and  reproductive organ toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of TSCA and in 40 CFR  Part 792--Good Laboratory Practice Standards apply to this section. The  following definitions also apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0">Dosage is a general term comprising of dose, its frequency and the  duration of dosing.</p><p class="depth0">Dose is the amount of test substance administered. Dose is expressed  as weight (g, mg) or as weight of test substance per unit weight of test  animal (e.g., mg/kg), or as constant dietary concentrations (parts per  million (ppm)).</p><p class="depth0">No-observed-effects level (NOEL) is the maximum dose used in a study  which produces no adverse effects. The NOEL is usually expressed in  terms of the weight of a test substance given daily per unit weight of  test animals (milligrams per kilograms per day).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Principle of the test. The test substance is orally administered  daily in graduated doses to several groups of experimental animals, one  dose level per group for a period of 28 days. During the period of  administration the animals are observed closely, each day for signs of  toxicity. Animals which die or are sacrificed during the test are  necropsied and at the conclusion of the test surviving animals are  sacrificed and necropsied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Description of the method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Selection of animal species. The  preferred rodent species is the rat, although other rodent species may  be used. Commonly used laboratory strains of young healthy adult animals  should be employed. The females should be nulliparous and non-pregnant.  Dosing should begin as soon as possible after weaning and, in any case,  before the animals are 9 weeks old. At the commencement of the study the  weight variation of animals used should be minimal and not exceed 20% of the mean weight of each sex. Where a repeated  dose oral study is conducted as a preliminary to a long term study,  preferably animals from the same strain and source should be used in  both studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Housing and feeding conditions. The temperature in the  experimental animal room should be 22 [deg]C (3  [deg]C). Although the relative humidity should be at least 30% and  preferably not to exceed 70% other than during room cleaning, the aim  should be 50-60%. Lighting should be artificial, the sequence being 12  hours light, 12 hours dark. For feeding, conventional laboratory diets  may be used with an unlimited supply of drinking water. The choice of  diet may be influenced by the need to ensure a suitable admixture of a  test substance when administered by this method. Animals may be housed  individually, or be caged in small groups of the same sex; for group  caging, no more than five animals should be housed per cage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Preparation of animals. Healthy young adult animals must be  randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups. Cages should be  arranged in such a way that possible effects due to cage placement are  minimized. The animals are identified uniquely and kept in their cages  for at least 5 days prior to the start of the study to allow for  acclimatization to the laboratory conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Preparation of doses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The test compound must be administered  by gavage or via the diet or drinking water. The method of oral  administration is dependent on the purpose of the study, and the  physical/chemical properties of the test material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where necessary, the test substance is dissolved or suspended  in a suitable vehicle. It is recommended that, wherever possible, the  use of an aqueous solution/suspension be considered first, followed by  consideration of a solution/emulsion in oil (e.g., corn oil) and then by  possible solution in other vehicles. For vehicles other than water the  toxic characteristics of the vehicle must be known. The stability of the  test substance in the vehicle should be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Number and sex of animals. At least 10 animals  (five female and five male) should be used at   each dose level. If interim sacrifices are planned, the number should be  increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before the  completion of the study. Consideration should be given to an additional  satellite group of 10 animals (five per sex) in the control and in the  top dose group for observation of reversibility, persistence, or delayed  occurrence of toxic effects, for at least 14 days post treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dosage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally, at least three test groups and a control  group should be used, but if from assessment of other data, no effects  would be expected at a dose of 1000 mg/kg bodyweight/per day, a limit  test may be performed. If there are no suitable data available, a range  finding study may be performed to aid the determination of the doses to  be used. Except for treatment with the test substance, animals in the  control group should be handled in an identical manner to the test group  subjects. If a vehicle is used in administering the test substance, the  control group should receive the vehicle in the highest volume used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dose levels should be selected taking into account any existing  toxicity and (toxico-) kinetic data available for the test compound or  related materials. The highest dose level should be chosen with the aim  of inducing toxic effects but not death or severe suffering. Thereafter,  a descending sequence of dose levels should be selected with a view to  demonstrating any dosage related response and NOEL at the lowest dose  level. Two to four fold intervals are frequently optimal for setting the  descending dose levels and addition of a fourth test group is often  preferable to using very large intervals (e.g., more than a factor of  10) between dosages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1000 mg/kg  body weight/day or, for dietary or drinking water administration, an  equivalent percentage in the diet, or drinking water (based upon body  weight determinations), using the procedures described for this study,  produces no observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be  expected based upon data from structurally related compounds, then a  full study using three dose levels may not be considered necessary. The  limit test applies except when human exposure indicates the need for a  higher dose level to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Administration of doses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The animals are dosed with the test  substance daily 7 days each week for a period of 28 days; use of a 5-day  per week dosing regime or a 14-day exposure period needs to be  justified. When the test substance is administered by gavage, this  should be done in a single dose to the animals using a stomach tube or a  suitable intubation cannula. The maximum volume of liquid that can be  administered at one time depends on the size of the test animal. The  volume should not exceed 1ml/100g body weight, except in the case of  aqueous solutions where 2ml/100g body weight may be used. Except for  irritating or corrosive substances which will normally reveal  exacerbated effects with higher concentrations, variability in test  volume should be minimized by adjusting the concentration to ensure a  constant volume at all dose levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For substances administered via the diet or drinking water it  is important to ensure that the quantities of the test substance  involved do not interfere with normal nutrition or water balance. When  the test substance is administered in the diet either a constant dietary  concentration (parts per million (ppm)) or a constant dose level in  terms of the animals' body weight may be used; the alternative used must  be specified. For a substance administered by gavage, the dose should be  given at similar times each day, and adjusted as necessary to maintain a  constant dose level in terms of animal body weight. Where a repeated  dose study is used as a preliminary to a long term study, a similar diet  should be used in both studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Observations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The observation period should be 28 days,  unless the study duration is 14 days (see paragraph (b)(1) of this  section). Animals in a satellite group scheduled for follow-up  observations should be kept for at least a further 14 days without  treatment to detect delayed occurrence, or persistence of, or recovery  from toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General clinical observations should be made at least once a  day,   preferably at the same time(s) each day and considering the peak period  of anticipated effects after dosing. The health condition of the animals  should be recorded. At least twice daily, all animals are observed for  morbidity and mortality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once before the first exposure (to allow for within-subject  comparisons), and at least once a week thereafter, detailed clinical  observations should be made in all animals. These observations should be  made outside the home cage in a standard arena and preferably at the  same time, each time. They should be carefully recorded, preferably  using scoring systems, explicitly defined by the testing laboratory.  Effort should be made to ensure that variations in the test conditions  are minimal and that observations are preferably conducted by observers  unaware of the treatment. Signs noted should include, but not be limited  to, changes in skin, fur, eyes, mucous membranes, occurrence of  secretions and excretions and autonomic activity (e.g., lacrimation,  piloerection, pupil size, unusual respiratory pattern). Changes in gait,  posture and response to handling as well as the presence of clonic or  tonic movements, stereotypies (e.g., excessive grooming, repetitive  circling) or bizarre behaviour (e.g., self-mutilation, walking  backwards) should also be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the fourth exposure week sensory reactivity to stimuli of  different types (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section) (e.g., auditory,  visual and proprioceptive stimuli), assessment of grip strength and  motor activity assessment should be conducted. Further details of the  procedures that could be followed are given in the respective  references. However, alternative procedures than those referenced could  also be used. Examples of procedures for observation are described in  the references in paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), (h)(4), and (h)(5)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Functional observations conducted in the fourth exposure week  may be omitted when the study is conducted as a preliminary study to a  subsequent subchronic (90-day) study. In that case, the functional  observations should be included in this follow-up study. On the other  hand, the availability of data on functional observations from the  repeated dose study may enhance the ability to select dose levels for a  subsequent subchronic study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Exceptionally, functional observations may also be omitted for  groups that otherwise reveal signs of toxicity to an extent that would  significantly interfere with the functional test performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Body weight and food/water consumption. All animals should be  weighed at least once a week. Measurements of food consumption should be  made at least weekly. If the test substance is administered via the  drinking water, water consumption should also be measured at least  weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Hematology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following hematological examinations should  be made at the end of the test period: hematocrit, hemoglobin  concentration, erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte  count, platelet count and a measure of blood clotting time/potential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Blood samples should be taken from a named site just prior to  or as part of the procedure for sacrificing the animals, and stored  under appropriate conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Clinical Biochemistry. (i) Clinical biochemistry determinations  to investigate major toxic effects in tissues and, specifically, effects  on kidney and liver, should be performed on blood samples obtained of  all animals just prior to or as part of the procedure for sacrificing  the animals (apart from those found moribund and/or intercurrently  sacrificed). Overnight fasting of the animals prior to blood sampling is  recommended. \1\ Investigations of plasma or serum shall include sodium,  potassium, glucose, total cholesterol,   urea, creatinine, total protein and albumin, at least two enzymes  indicative of hepatocellular effects (such as alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl  transpeptidase, and sorbitol dehydrogenase). Measurements of additional  enzymes (of hepatic or other origin) and bile acids may provide useful  information under certain circumstances. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For a number of measurements in serum and plasma, most notably  for glucose, overnight fasting would be preferable. The major reason for  this preference is that the increased variability which would inevitably  result from non-fasting, would tend to mask more subtle effects and make  interpretation difficult. On the other hand, however, overnight fasting  may interfere with the general metabolism of the animals and,  particularly in feeding studies, may disturb the daily exposure to the  test substance. If overnight fasting is adopted, clinical biochemical  determinations should be performed after the conduct of functional  observations in week 4 of the study. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Optionally, the following urinalysis determinations could be  performed during the last week of the study using timed urine volume  collection; appearance, volume, osmolality or specific gravity, pH,  protein, glucose and blood and blood cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In addition, studies to investigate serum markers of general  tissue damage should be considered. Other determinations that should be  carried out if the known properties of the test substance may, or are  suspected to, affect related metabolic profiles include calcium,  phosphate, fasting triglycerides, specific hormones, methemoglobin and  cholinesterase. These must to be identified for chemicals in certain  classes or on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Overall, there is a need for a flexible approach, depending on  the species and the observed and/or expected effect with a given  compound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If historical baseline data are inadequate, consideration should  be given to determination of hematological and clinical biochemistry  variables before dosing commences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Pathology--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>Gross necropsy. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All animals in the study must  be subjected to a full, detailed gross necropsy which includes careful  examination of the external surface of the body, all orifices, and the  cranial, thoracic and abdominal cavities and their contents. The liver,  kidneys, adrenals, testes, epididymides, thymus, spleen, brain and heart  of all animals (apart from those found moribund and/or intercurrently  sacrificed) should be trimmed of any adherent tissue, as appropriate,  and their wet weight taken as soon as possible after dissection to avoid  drying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The following tissues should be preserved in the most  appropriate fixation medium for both the type of tissue and the intended  subsequent histopathological examination: all gross lesions, brain  (representative regions including cerebrum, cerebellum and pons), spinal  cord, stomach, small and large intestines (including Peyer's patches),  liver, kidneys, adrenals, spleen, heart, thymus, thyroid, trachea and  lungs (preserved by inflation with fixative and then immersion),  ovaries, uterus, testes, epididymides, accessory sex organs (e.g.,  prostate, seminal vesicles), urinary bladder, lymph nodes (preferably  one lymph node covering the route of administration and another one  distant from the route of administration to cover systemic effects),  peripheral nerve (sciatic or tibial) preferably in close proximity to  the muscle, and a section of bone marrow (or, alternatively, a fresh  mounted bone marrow aspirate). The clinical and other findings may  suggest the need to examine additional tissues. Also any organs  considered likely to be target organs based on the known properties of  the test substance should be preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Histopathology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Full histopathology should be carried out  on the preserved organs and tissues of all animals in the control and  high dose groups. These examinations should be extended to animals of  all other dosage groups, if treatment-related changes are observed in  the high dose group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All gross lesions must be examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When a satellite group is used, histopathology should be  performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the  treated groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual data should be  provided. Additionally, all data should be summarized in tabular form  showing for each test group the number of animals at the start of the  test, the number of animals found dead during the test or sacrificed for  humane reasons and the time of any death or humane sacrifice, the number  showing signs of toxicity, a   description of the signs of toxicity observed, including time of onset,  duration, and severity of any toxic effects, the number of animals  showing lesions, the type of lesions and the percentage of animals  displaying each type of lesion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When possible, numerical results should be evaluated by an  appropriate and generally acceptable statistical method. The statistical  methods should be selected during the design of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test report. The test report must include the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test substance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Physical nature, purity and physicochemical properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identification data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vehicle (if appropriate): Justification for choice of vehicle,  if other than water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Test animals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Species/strain used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Number, age and sex of animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Source, housing conditions, diet, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Individual weights of animals at the start of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rationale for dose level selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Details of test substance formulation/diet preparation, achieved  concentration, stability and homogeneity of the preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Details of the administration of the test substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Conversion from diet/drinking water test substance concentration  (parts per million (ppm)) to the actual dose (mg/kg body weight/day), if  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Details of food and water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Results:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Body weight/body weight changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Food consumption, and water consumption, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Toxic response data by sex and dose level, including signs of  toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Nature, severity and duration of clinical observations (whether  reversible or not).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Sensory activity, grip strength and motor activity assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Hematological tests with relevant base-line values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Clinical biochemistry tests with relevant base-line values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Body weight at sacrificing and organ weight data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Necropsy findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> A detailed description of all histopathological findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Absorption data if available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Statistical treatment of results, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Discussion of results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Conclusions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> References.
