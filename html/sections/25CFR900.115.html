The Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in Sec. 900.131.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional ``procurement'' contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to a construction contract (or a subcontract of such a construction contract), the provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated under that Act, shall apply to a construction contract or subcontract only to the extent that application of the provision is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Necessary to ensure that the contract may be carried out in a satisfactory manner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Directly related to the construction activity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not inconsistent with the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of the Federal requirements that meet the requirements of this paragraph shall be included in an attachment to the contract under negotiations between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no Federal law listed in section 105(3)(C)(ii) of the Act or any other provision of Federal law (including an Executive order) relating to acquisition by the Federal government shall apply to a construction contract that an Indian tribe or tribal organization enters into under this Act, unless expressly provided in the law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provisions of a construction contract under this subpart shall be liberally construed in favor of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization.</p>
