Unless a rule is required by statute, the Chairman of a Special Panel may suspend the rule, in the interest of expediting a decision or for other good cause shown, and may conduct the proceedings in a manner he or she directs. The Chairman may take this action at the request of a party, or on his or her own motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time limit for proceedings. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7702(d)(2)(A), the Special Panel will issue a decision within 45 days after a matter has been certified to it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative assistance to the Special Panel.

If the Board and the Commission disagree on the manner in which costs are to be divided, the Chairman of the Special Panel will resolve the disagreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintaining the official record. The Board will maintain the official record of the appeal. It will transmit two copies of each submission that is filed to each member of the Special Panel in an expeditious manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Filing and service of pleadings.

The Office of the Clerk will serve one copy of each submission on the other parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certificate of service specifying how and when service was made must accompany all submissions of the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service may be made by mail or by personal delivery during the Board's normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.).

A submission that is delivered personally is considered to have been filed on the date the Office of the Clerk of the Board receives it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Briefs and responsive pleadings.

The parties have the right to present oral argument. Parties wishing to exercise this right must indicate this desire when they file their briefs or, if no briefs are filed, within 15 days after the date of the Board's certification order. Upon receiving a request for argument, the Chairman of the Special Panel will determine the time and place for argument and the amount of time to be allowed each side, and he or she will provide this information to the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Postargument submission. Because of the short statutory time limit for processing these cases, the parties may not file postargument submissions unless the Chairman of the Special Panel permits those submissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Procedural matters. Any procedural matters not addressed in these regulations will be resolved by written order of the Chairman of the Special Panel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Electronic filing.
