If the claimant, the claimant's spouse, or a person described in Sec. 404.612 contacts us through the Internet by completing and transmitting the Personal Identification Information data on the Internet Social Security Benefit Application to us, we will use the date of the transmission as the filing date if it is necessary to prevent the loss of benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The claimant files an application with us on an application form as described in Sec. 404.611, or one is filed for the claimant by a person described in Sec. 404.612, within 6 months after the date of a notice we will send advising of the need to file an application. We will send the notice to the claimant. However, if it is clear from the information we receive that the claimant is a minor or is mentally incompetent, we will send the notice to the person who submitted the written statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The claimant is alive when the application is filed; or if the claimant has died after the written statement was filed, an application is filed--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By or for a person who would be eligible to receive benefits on the deceased's earnings record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By a person acting for the deceased's estate; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the statement was filed with a hospital under Sec. 404.632, by the hospital if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No person described in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section can be located; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person described in paragraphs (d) (1) or (2) of this section is located
