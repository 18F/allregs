                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Organic solvents include diluents and thinners and are defined  as organic materials which are liquids at standard conditions and which  are used as dissolvers, viscosity reducers, or cleaning agents, except  that such materials which exhibit a boiling point higher than 220  [deg]F. at 0.5 millimeters of mercury absolute pressure or having an  equivalent vapor pressure shall not be considered to be solvents unless  exposed to temperatures exceeding 220 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Solvent of high photochemical reactivity means any solvent with  an aggregate of more than 20 percent of its total volume composed of the  chemical compounds classified below or which exceeds any of the  following individual percentage composition limitations in reference to  the total volume of solvent:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A combination of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters,  ethers, or ketones having an olefinic or   cycloolefinic type of unsaturation: 5 percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A combination of aromatic compounds with eight or more carbon  atoms to the molecule except ethylbenzene: 8 percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A combination of ethylbenzene, ketones having branched  hydrocarbon structures, trichloroethylene or toluene: 20 percent.  Whenever any organic solvent or any constituent of an organic solvent  may be classified from its chemical structure into more than one of the  above groups of organic compounds, it shall be considered as a member of  the most reactive chemical group, that is, that group having the least  allowable percentage of total volume of solvents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Organic materials are chemical compounds of carbon excluding  carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides,  metallic carbonates, and ammonium carbonate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section is applicable throughout the Boston Intrastate  Region. The requirements of this section shall be in effect in  accordance with Sec. 52.1147.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No person shall cause, allow, suffer, or permit the discharge  into the atmosphere of more than 15 pounds of organic materials in any 1  day, nor more than 3 pounds of organic materials in any 1 hour, from any  article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance, in which any organic  solvent or any material containing organic solvent comes into contact  with flame or is baked, heat-cured, or heat-polymerized, in the presence  of oxygen, unless said discharge has been reduced as a result of the  installation of abatement controls by at least 85 percent. Those  portions of any series of articles, machines, equipment, or other  contrivances designed for processing a continuous web, strip, or wire  that emit organic materials and use operations described in this section  shall be collectively subject to compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the discharge  into the atmosphere of more than 40 pounds of organic materials in any 1  day, nor more than 8 pounds in any 1 hour, from any article, machine,  equipment, or other contrivance used under conditions other than  described in paragraph (c) of this section for employing, or applying  any solvent of high photochemical reactivity or material containing such  photochemically reactive solvent, unless said discharge has been reduced  as a result of the installation of abatement controls by at least 85  percent. Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere resulting  from air or heated drying of products for the first 12 hours after their  removal from any article, machine, equipment or other contrivance  described in this section shall be included in determining compliance  with this section. Emissions resulting from baking, heat-curing, or  heat-polymerizing as described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be  excluded from determination of compliance with this section. Those  portions of any series of articles, machines, equipment, or other  contrivances designed for processing a continuous web, strip, or wire  that emit organic materials and use operations described in this section  shall be collectively subject to compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emissions of organic materials to the atmosphere from the clean- up with a solvent of high photochemical reactivity, or any article,  machine, equipment, or other contrivance described in paragraph (c) or  (d) of this section or in this paragraph, shall be included with the  other emissions of organic materials from that article, machine,  equipment or other contrivance for determining compliance with this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit during any one  day disposal of a total of more than 1.5 gallons of any solvent of high  photochemical reactivity, or of any material containing more than 1.5  gallons of any such photochemically reactive solvent by any means that  will permit the evaporation of such solvent into the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere required to  be controlled by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall be reduced  by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incineration, provided that 90 percent or more of the carbon in  the organic material being incinerated is converted to carbon dioxide,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adsorption, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The use of other abatement control equipment determined by the  Regional Administrator to be no less effective than either of the above  methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A person incinerating, adsorbing, or otherwise processing  organic materials pursuant to this section shall provide, properly  install and maintain in calibration, in good working order, and in  operation, devices as specified in the authority to construct, or as  specified by the Regional Administrator, for indicating temperatures,  pressures, rates of flow, or other operating conditions necessary to  determine the degree and effectiveness of air pollution control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Any person using organic solvents or any materials containing  organic solvents shall supply the Regional Administrator upon request  and in the manner and form prescribed by him, written evidence of the  chemical composition, physical properties, and amount consumed for each  organic solvent used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The provisions of this rule shall not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacture of organic solvents, or the transport or storage  of organic solvents or materials containing organic solvents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The spraying or other use of insecticides, pesticides, or  herbicides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employment, application, evaporation, or drying of saturated  halogenated hydrocarbons or perchloroethylene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The use of any material, in any article, machine, equipment or  other contrivance described in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this  section if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The volatile content of such material consists only of water,  and organic solvents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The organic solvents comprise not more than 30 percent by  volume of said volatile content;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The volatile content is not a solvent of high photochemical  reactivity as defined in paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The organic solvent or any material containing organic solvent  does not come into contact with flame.
