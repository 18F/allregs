                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> provides the general  rule that all computations entering into the determination of taxes  imposed by part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, shall be made  under an accrual method of accounting. Thus, the over-all method of  accounting for life insurance companies shall be the accrual method.  Except as otherwise provided in part I, the term ``accrual method''  shall have the same meaning and application in section 818 as it does  under section 446 (relating to general rule for methods of accounting)  and the regulations thereunder. For general rules relating to the  taxable year for inclusion of income   and deduction of expenses under an accrual method of accounting, see  sections 451 and 461 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, a life insurance company may elect to compute its  taxable income under an over-all method of accounting consisting of the  accrual method combined with the special methods of accounting for  particular items of income and expense provided under other sections of  chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, other than the cash  receipts and disbursements method. These methods of accounting for  special items include the accounting treatment provided for depreciation  (section 167), research and experimental expenditures (section 174),  soil and water conservation expenditures (section 175), organizational  expenditures (section 248), etc. In addition, a life insurance company  may, where applicable, use the crop method of accounting (as provided in  the regulations under sections 61 and 162), and the installment method  of accounting for sales of realty and casual sales of personalty (as  provided in section 453(b)). To the extent not inconsistent with the  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the regulations  thereunder and the method of accounting adopted by the taxpayer pursuant  to this section, all computations entering into the determination of  taxes imposed by part I shall be made in a manner consistent with the  manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An election to use any of the special methods of accounting  referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which was made  pursuant to any provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or prior  revenue laws for purposes of determining a company's tax liabilities for  prior years, shall have the same force and effect in determining the  items of gross investment income under section 804(b) and the items of  deduction under section 804(c) of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax  Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) as if such Act had not been enacted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under  section 809(b), in computing the life insurance company's share of  investment yield under section 809(b) (1)(A) and (2)(A), an election  with respect to any of the special methods of accounting referred to in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which was made pursuant to any  provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or prior revenue laws,  shall not be affected in any way by the enactment of the Life Insurance  Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under  section 809(b), in computing the items of gross amount under section  809(c) and the deduction items under section 809(d), an election to use  any of the special methods of accounting referred to in subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph must be made in accordance with the specific statutory  provisions of the sections containing such elections and the regulations  thereunder. However, where a particular election may be made only with  the consent of the Commissioner (either because the time for making the  election without the consent of the Commissioner has expired or because  the particular section contained no provision for making an election  without consent), and the time prescribed by the applicable regulations  for submitting a request for permission to make such an election for the  taxable year 1958 has expired, a life insurance company may make such an  election for the year 1958 at the time of filing its return for that  year (including extensions thereof). For example, a life insurance  company may elect any of the methods of depreciation prescribed   in section 167 (to the extent permitted under that section and the  regulations thereunder) with respect to those assets, or any portion  thereof, for which no depreciation was allowable under prior revenue  laws, for example, furniture and fixtures used in the underwriting  department. Similarly, a life insurance company shall be permitted to  make an election under section 461(c) (relating to the accrual of real  property taxes) with respect to real property for which no deduction was  allowable under prior revenue laws. Any such election shall be made in  the manner and form prescribed in the applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the  method used under section 1016(a)(3)(C) (relating to adjustments to  basis) in determining the amount of exhaustion, wear and tear,  obsolescence, and amortization actually sustained shall not preclude a  taxpayer from electing any of the methods prescribed in section 167 in  accordance with the provisions of that section and the regulations  thereunder for determining the amount of such exhaustion, wear and tear,  obsolescence, and amortization for the year 1958. For example, if the  amount of depreciation actually sustained, under section 1016(a)(3)(C),  on a life insurance company's home office building (other than that  portion for which depreciation was allowable under prior revenue laws)  is determined on the straight line method, the life insurance company  may elect for the year 1958 to use any of the methods prescribed in  section 167 for determining its depreciation allowance for 1958.  However, such election shall be binding for 1958, and for all subsequent  taxable years, unless consent to change such election, if required, is  obtained from the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of  section 167 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> For purposes of section 805(b)(3)(B)(i) (relating to the  determination of the current earnings rate for any taxable year  beginning before January 1, 1958), the determination for any year of the  investment yield and the assets shall be made as though the taxpayer had  been on the accrual method prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph for such year, or the accrual method in combination with the  other methods of accounting prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, if these other methods of accounting are used by the taxpayer  in determining the investment yield and assets for the taxable year  1958. However, where the method used for determining the deduction under  section 167 for the year 1958 differs from the method used in prior  years, the amount of the deduction actually allowed or allowable for  such prior years for purposes of section 1016(a)(2) (relating to  adjustments to basis) shall be the amount to be taken into account in  determining the current earnings rate under section 805(b)(3)(B)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of section 812(b)(1)(C) (relating to operations  loss carrybacks and carryovers for years prior to 1958), the  determination for those years of the gain or loss from operations shall  be made as though the taxpayer had been on the accrual method of  accounting prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for such  year, or the accrual method in combination with the other methods of  accounting prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if these  other methods of accounting are used by the taxpayer in the  determination of gain or loss from operations for the taxable year 1958.  However, where any adjustment to basis is required under section  1016(a)(3)(C) on account of exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence,  amortization, and depletion sustained, the amount actually sustained as  determined under section 1016(a)(3)(C) for each of the years involved  shall be the amount allowed in the determination of gain or loss from  operations for purposes of section 812(b)(1)(C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments required if accrual method of accounting was not  used in 1957. The items of gross amount taken into account under section  809(c) and the items of deductions allowed under section 809(d) for the  taxable year 1958 shall be determined as though the taxpayer had been on  the accrual method of accounting prescribed in paragraph (a) of this  section for all prior years. Thus, life insurance companies not on the  accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957,   those items of gross amount which would have been properly taken into  account for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method  described in section 818(a). Likewise, life insurance companies not on  the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31,  1957, those items of deductions which would have been properly allowed  for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method  described in section 818(a). For example, if certain premium amounts  were received during the year 1958 but such amounts would have been  properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the taxpayer had been  on the accrual method for the year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be  required to take such premium amounts into account for the year 1958.  If, for example, certain claims, benefits, and losses were paid during  the year 1958 but such items would have been properly taken into account  for the year 1957 if the taxpayer had been on the accrual method for the  year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be permitted to deduct such  expense items for the year 1958. For a special transitional rule  applicable with respect to changes in method of accounting required by  section 818(a) and paragraph (a) of this section, see section 818(e) and  Sec. 1.818-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> as of the close of the taxable year  differs from the basis for such determination as of the beginning of the  taxable year, then for purposes of subpart B, part I, subchapter L,  chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the determination of taxable  investment income), the amount of such item shall be the amount computed  on the old basis as of the close of the taxable year and the amount  computed on the new basis as of the beginning of the next taxable year.  Similarly, section 810(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> provides rules for determining the amount  of the adjustment to be made for purposes of subpart C, part I,  subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the determination of  gain or loss from operations), if the basis for determining any item  referred to in section 810(c) as of the close of any taxable year  differs from the basis for such determination as of the close of the  preceding taxable year. Under an accrual method of accounting, a change  in the basis or method of computing the amount of liability of any item  referred to in section 810(c) occurs in the taxable year in which all  the events have occurred which determine the change in the basis or  method of computing the amount of such liability and, in which, the  amount thereof (whether increased or decreased) can be determined with  reasonable accuracy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Assume that during the taxable year 1960, M, a life  insurance company, determines that the amount of its life insurance  reserves held with respect to a particular block of contracts is  understated on the present basis being used in valuing such liability  and that such liability can be more accurately reflected by changing  from the present basis to a particular new basis. Assume that M uses  such new basis in computing its reserves under such contracts at the end  of the taxable year 1960. Under the provisions of section 818(a) and  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the change in basis for purposes of  sections 806(b) and 810(d) occurs during the taxable year 1960, the year  in which all the events have occurred which determine the change in  basis and the amount of any increase (or decrease) attributable to such  change can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Such change shall be  treated as having occurred during the taxable year 1960 whether M  determines that its liability under such contracts was understated for  the first time during 1960, or that its liability under such contracts  has, in fact, been understated for a number of prior years.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except  that during the taxable year 1960 the insurance department of State X  issues a ruling, pursuant to authority conferred by statute, requiring M  to use the particular new basis which more accurately reflects its  liability with respect to such contracts and that as a result of such  ruling, M uses the new basis in computing its reserves under such  contracts for the taxable years 1958, 1959, and 1960. Under the  provisions of section 818(a) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the  change in basis for purposes of sections 806(b) and 810(d) occurs during  the taxable year 1960, the year in which all the events have occurred  which determine that a change in basis should be   made and the amount of any increase (or decrease) attributable to such  change can be determined with reasonable accuracy.
