                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Non-Federal interests, which include State, county and local governments; federally recognized Indian Tribes; and Alaska Native Corporations, are required to make full use of their own resources before Federal assistance can be furnished. The National Guard, as part of the State's resources when it is under State control, must be fully utilized as part of the non-Federal response. Non-Federal responsibilities include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disaster preparedness. Disaster preparedness is a basic tenet of State and local responsibility. Disaster preparedness responsibilities of non-Federal interests include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operation and maintenance of flood control works;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procurement and stockpiling of sandbags, pumps, and/or other materials or equipment that might be needed during flood situations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Training personnel to operate, maintain, and patrol projects during crisis situations, and preparation of plans to address emergency situations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Taking those actions necessary for flood control works to gain and maintain an Active status in the Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), as detailed in subpart D of this part; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Responsible regulation, management, and use of floodplain areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergency operations. During emergency operations, non-Federal interests must commit available resources, to include work force, supplies, equipment, and funds. Requests for Corps emergency operations assistance will be in writing from the appropriate State, tribal, or local official. For flood fight direct assistance and Post Flood Response assistance, non-Federal interests must furnish formal written assurances of local cooperation by entering into Cooperation Agreements (CA's), as detailed in subpart G of this regulation. (For Corps work authorized under Public Law 84-99, the term ``Cooperation Agreement'' is used to differentiate this agreement from a Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) that addresses the original construction of a project.) Following Flood Response or Post Flood Response assistance, it is a non-Federal responsibility to remove expedient flood control structures and similar works installed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects. Prior to Corps rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects, non-Federal interests must furnish formal written assurances of local cooperation by entering into a CA, as detailed in subpart G of this part. Requirements of local participation include such items as provision of lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and suitable borrow and dredged or excavated material disposal areas (LERRD's), applicable cost-sharing, and costs attributable to deficient and/or deferred maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects. Sponsors of Federal flood control projects are usually not required to furnish written assurances of local cooperation, if the PCA for the original construction of the project is sufficient. (Note: The PCA may also be referred to as a local cooperation agreement (LCA), cooperation and participation agreement (C&P;), or similar terms.) In lieu of a new PCA, the Corps will notify the sponsor of the sponsor's standing requirements, including such items as LERRD's, costs attributable to deficient or deferred maintenance, removal of temporary works, relocations, and any cost-sharing requirements contained in subpart G of Sec. 203.82. Modifications to the existing Operation and Maintenance Manual may be required based on the Rehabilitation Assistance required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency water supplies due to contaminated water source. Except for federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations, Non-Federal interests must first seek emergency water assistance through the Governor of the affected State. If the State is unable to provide the needed assistance, then the Governor or his or her authorized representative must request Corps assistance in writing. Similarly, requests for Corps assistance for Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations must be submitted in writing. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Requests for assistance must include information concerning the criteria prescribed by subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Drought assistance. Except for federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations, non-Federal interests must first seek emergency drinking water assistance through the Governor of the affected State. Requests for Corps assistance will be in writing from the Governor or his or her authorized representative. Similarly, requests for Corps assistance for Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations must be submitted in writing. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Assistance can be provided to those drought-distressed areas (as declared by the Secretary of the Army) to construct wells and to transport water for

human consumption. Requests for assistance must include information concerning the criteria prescribed by subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Advance Measures. Advance Measures assistance should complement the maximum non-Federal capability. Requests for assistance must be made by the Governor of the affected State, except requests for assistance on tribal lands held in trust by the United States, or on lands of the Alaska Natives, may be submitted directly by the affected Federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation, or through the regional representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or through the Governor of the State in which the lands are located. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Non-Federal participation may include either financial contribution or commitment of non-Federal physical resources, or both.</p>
