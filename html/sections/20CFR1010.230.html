Specifically, States must develop policies for the delivery of priority of service by the State Workforce Agency or Agencies, Local Workforce Investment Boards, and One-Stop Career Centers for all qualified job training programs delivered through the State's workforce system. The policy or policies must require that processes are in place to ensure that covered persons are identified at the point of entry and given an opportunity to take full advantage of priority of service. These processes shall be undertaken to ensure that covered persons are aware of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Their entitlement to priority of service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State's policy or policies must require Local Workforce Investment Boards to develop and include in their strategic local plan, policies implementing priority of service for the local One-Stop Career Centers and for service delivery by local workforce preparation and training providers.
