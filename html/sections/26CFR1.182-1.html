                                Sec. 1.182-1  Expenditures by farmers for clearing land; in general.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under section 182, a taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may elect, in the manner provided in Sec. 1.182-6, to deduct certain expenditures paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, in the clearing of land. The expenditures to which the election applies are all expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year in clearing land for the purpose of making the ``land suitable for use in farming'' (as defined in Sec. 1.182-4) which are not otherwise deductible (exclusive of expenditures for or in connection with depreciable items referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.182-3), but only if such expenditures are made in furtherance of the taxpayer's business of farming. The term expenditures to which the election applies also includes a reasonable allowance for depreciation (not otherwise allowable) on equipment used in the clearing of land provided such equipment, if used in the carrying on of a trade or business, would be subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. (See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.182-3.) (See section 175 and the regulations thereunder for deductibility of certain expenditures for treatment or moving of earth by a farmer where the land already qualifies as land used in farming as defined in Sec. 1.175-4.) The amount deductible for any taxable year is limited to the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of the taxable income derived from farming (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.182-5) during the taxable year. Expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible under section 182 for such taxable year shall be treated as capital expenditures and shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of the land under section 1016(a).
