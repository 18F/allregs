                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> General. Under the procedures in this section, the Secretary determines the completion rates, withdrawal rates, repayment rates, median loan debt, mean and median earnings, and program cohort default rate an institution must disclose under Sec.  668.412 for each of its GE programs, notifies the institution of that information, and provides the institution an opportunity to challenge the calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Under the procedures in this section, the Secretary determines the completion rates, withdrawal rates, repayment rates, median loan debt, mean and median earnings, and program cohort default rate an institution must disclose under Sec.  668.412 for each of its GE programs, notifies the institution of that information, and provides the institution an opportunity to challenge the calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enrollment cohort. (i) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, for the purpose of calculating the completion and withdrawal rates under paragraph (b) of this section, the enrollment cohort is comprised of all the students who began enrollment in a GE program during an award year. For example, the students who began enrollment in a GE program during the 2014-2015 award year constitute the enrollment cohort for that award year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, for the purpose of calculating the completion and withdrawal rates under paragraph (b) of this section, the enrollment cohort is comprised of all the students who began enrollment in a GE program during an award year. For example, the students who began enrollment in a GE program during the 2014-2015 award year constitute the enrollment cohort for that award year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A student is excluded from the enrollment cohort for the purpose of calculating the completion and withdrawal rates under paragraph (b) of this section if, while enrolled in the program, the student died or became totally and permanently disabled and was unable to continue enrollment on at least a half-time basis, as determined under the standards in 34 CFR 685.213.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculating completion rates, withdrawal rates, repayment rates, median loan debt, mean and median earnings, and program cohort default rate-- (1) Completion rates. For each enrollment cohort, the Secretary calculates the completion rates of a GE program as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Completion rates. For each enrollment cohort, the Secretary calculates the completion rates of a GE program as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For students whose enrollment status is full-time on the first day of the student's enrollment in the program:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04DE14.000



[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04DE14.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For students whose enrollment status is less than full-time on the first day of the student's enrollment in the program:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31OC14.066</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withdrawal rate. For each enrollment cohort, the Secretary calculates two withdrawal rates for a GE program as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The percentage of students in the enrollment cohort who withdrew from the program within 100 percent of the length of the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of students in the enrollment cohort who withdrew from the program within 150 percent of the length of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Loan repayment rate. For an award year, the Secretary calculates a loan repayment rate for borrowers not excluded under paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section who enrolled in a GE program as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31OC14.067</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Number of borrowers entering repayment. The total number of borrowers who entered repayment during the two-year cohort period on FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Number of borrowers paid in full. Of the number of borrowers entering repayment, the number who have fully repaid all FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Number of borrowers in active repayment. Of the number of borrowers entering repayment, the number who, during the most recently completed award year, made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the program, including consolidation loans that include a FFEL or Direct Loan received for enrollment in the program, by comparing the outstanding balance of each loan at the beginning and end of the award year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Loan defaults. A borrower who defaulted on a FFEL or Direct Loan is not included in the numerator of the loan repayment rate formula even if that loan has been paid in full or meets the definition of being in active repayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Repayment rates for borrowers who completed or withdrew. The Secretary may modify the formula in this paragraph to calculate repayment rates for only those borrowers who completed the program or for only those borrowers who withdrew from the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Exclusions. For the award year the Secretary calculates the loan repayment rate for a program, the Secretary excludes a borrower from the repayment rate calculation if the Secretary determines that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One or more of the borrower's FFEL or Direct loans were in a military-related deferment status at any time during the most recently completed award year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One or more of the borrower's FFEL or Direct loans are either under consideration by the Secretary, or have been approved, for a discharge on the basis of the borrower's total and permanent disability, under 34 CFR 682.402 or 685.212;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The borrower was enrolled in any other eligible program at the institution or at another institution during the most recently completed award year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The borrower died.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Median loan debt for students who completed the GE program. For the most recently completed award year, the Secretary calculates a median loan debt for the students described in Sec.  668.412(a)(10)(i) who completed the GE program during the award year. The median is calculated on debt described in Sec.  668.404(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Median loan debt for students who withdrew from the GE program. For the most recently completed award year, the Secretary calculates a median loan debt for the students described in Sec.  668.412(a)(10)(ii) who withdrew from the program during the award year. The median is calculated on debt described in Sec.  668.404(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Median loan debt for students who completed and withdrew from the GE program. For the most recently completed award year, the Secretary calculates a median loan debt for the students described in Sec.  668.412(a)(10)(iii) who completed the GE program during the award year and those students who withdrew from the GE program during the award year. The median is calculated on debt described in Sec.  668.404(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Mean and median earnings. The Secretary calculates the mean and median earnings of a GE program as described in paragraphs (b)(8) through (b)(12) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Mean and median earnings for students who completed the GE program. (i) The Secretary determines the mean and median earnings for the students who completed the GE program during the cohort period by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary determines the mean and median earnings for the students who completed the GE program during the cohort period by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Creating a list of the students who completed the program during the cohort period and providing it to the institution, as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Allowing the institution to correct the information about the students on the list, as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Obtaining from SSA the median annual earnings of the students on the list, as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Notifying the institution of the median annual earnings for the students on the list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Creating the list of students.
