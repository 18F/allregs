                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fixed-price incentive (successive targets)  contract specifies the following elements, all of which are negotiated  at the outset:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An initial target cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An initial target profit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An initial profit adjustment formula to be used for  establishing the firm target profit, including a ceiling and floor for  the firm target profit. (This formula normally provides for a lesser  degree of contractor cost responsibility than would a formula for  establishing final profit and price.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The production point at which the firm target cost and firm  target profit will be negotiated (usually before delivery or shop  completion of the first item).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A ceiling price that is the maximum that may be paid to the  contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract clauses  providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract  price under stated circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the production point specified in the contract is reached,  the parties negotiate the firm target cost, giving consideration to cost  experience under the contract and other pertinent factors. The firm  target profit is established by the formula. At this point, the parties  have two alternatives, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> They may negotiate a firm fixed price, using the firm target  cost plus the firm target profit as a guide.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If negotiation of a firm fixed price is inappropriate, they may  negotiate a formula for establishing the final price using the firm  target cost and firm target profit. The final cost is then negotiated at  completion, and the final profit is established by formula, as under the  fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract (see 16.403-1 above).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A fixed-price incentive (successive targets)  contract is appropriate when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Available cost or pricing information is not sufficient to  permit the negotiation of a realistic firm target cost and profit before  award;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sufficient information is available to permit negotiation of  initial targets; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is reasonable assurance that additional reliable  information will be available at an early point in the contract  performance so as to permit negotiation of either (i) a firm fixed price  or (ii) firm targets and a formula for establishing final profit and  price that will provide a fair and reasonable incentive. This additional  information is not limited to experience under the contract, itself, but  may be drawn from other contracts for the same or similar items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. This contract type may be used only when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor's accounting system is adequate for providing  data for negotiating firm targets and a realistic profit adjustment  formula, as well as later negotiation of final costs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost or pricing information adequate for establishing a  reasonable firm target cost is reasonably expected to be available at an  early point in contract performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contract Schedule. The contracting officer shall specify in the  contract Schedule the initial target cost, initial target profit, and  initial target price for each item subject to incentive price revision.
