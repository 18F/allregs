                                Sec. 158.240  Rebating premium if the applicable medical loss ratio
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. For each MLR reporting year, an issuer must  provide a rebate to each enrollee if the issuer's MLR does not meet or  exceed the minimum percentage required by Sec. Sec. 158.210 and 158.211  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of enrollee for purposes of rebate. For the sole  purpose of determining whom is entitled to receive a rebate pursuant to  this part, the term ``enrollee'' means the subscriber, policyholder,  and/or government entity that paid the premium for health care coverage  received by an individual during the respective MLR reporting year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of rebate to each enrollee. (1) For each MLR reporting  year, an issuer must rebate to the enrollee the total amount of premium  revenue, as defined in Sec. 158.130, received by the issuer from the  enrollee, after subtracting Federal and State taxes and licensing and  regulatory fees as provided in Sec. Sec. 158.161(a) and 158.162(a)(1)  and (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk  adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance as provided in Sec.  158.130(b)(5), multiplied by the difference between the MLR required by  Sec. 158.210 or Sec. 158.211, and the issuer's MLR as calculated under  Sec. 158.221.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For example, an issuer must rebate a pro rata portion of premium  revenue if it does not meet an 80 percent MLR for the individual market  in a State that has not set a higher MLR. If an issuer has a 75 percent  MLR for the coverage it offers in the individual market in a State that  has not set a higher MLR, the issuer must rebate 5 percent of the  premium paid by or on behalf of the enrollee for the MLR reporting year  after subtracting a pro rata portion of taxes and fees and accounting  for payments or receipts related to the reinsurance, risk adjustment and  risk corridors programs (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as  described in Sec. 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent).  If the issuer's total earned premium for the MLR reporting year in the  individual market in the State is $200,000, the issuer received  transitional reinsurance payments of $2,500, and made net payments  related to risk adjustment and risk corridors of $20,000 (calculated  using an adjustment percentage, as described in Sec. 153.500 of this  subchapter, equal to zero percent), the issuer's gross earned premium in  the individual market in the State would be $200,000 plus $2,500 minus  $20,000, for a total of $182,500. If the issuer's Federal and State  taxes and licensing and regulatory fees, including reinsurance  contributions, that may be excluded from premium revenue as described in  Sec. Sec. 158.161(a), 158.162(a)(1) and 158.162(b)(1), allocated to the  individual market in the State are $15,000, and the net payments related  to risk adjustment and risk corridors, reduced by reinsurance receipts,  that must be accounted for in premium revenue as described in Sec. Sec.  158.130(b)(5), 158.221, and 158.240, are $17,500 ($20,000 reduced by  $2,500), then the issuer would subtract $15,000 and add $17,500 to gross  premium revenue of $182,500, for a base of $185,000 in premium. The  issuer would owe rebates of 5 percent of $185,000, or $9,250 in the  individual market in the State. In this example, if an enrollee of the  issuer in the individual market in the State paid $2,000 in premiums for  the MLR reporting year, or 1/100 of the issuer's total premium in that  State market, then the enrollee would be entitled to 1/100 of the total  rebates owed by the issuer, or $92.50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of rebate. For each of the 2011, 2012, and 2013 MLR  reporting years, an issuer must provide any rebate owing to an enrollee  no later than August 1 following the end of the MLR reporting year.  Beginning with the 2014 MLR reporting year, an issuer must   provide any rebate owing to an enrollee no later than September 30  following the end of the MLR reporting year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Late payment interest. An issuer that fails to pay any rebate  owing to an enrollee or subscriber in accordance with paragraph (d) of  this section or to take other required action within the time periods  set forth in this part must, in addition to providing the required  rebate to the enrollee, pay the enrollee interest at the current Federal  Reserve Board lending rate or ten percent annually, whichever is higher,  on the total amount of the rebate, accruing from the date payment was  due under paragraph (d) of this section.
