                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may use a fleet charge card specifically issued for this  purpose. These cards are designed to collect motor vehicle data at the  time of purchase. Where appropriate, State sales and motor fuel taxes  may be deducted from fuel purchases by the fleet charge card services  contractor before your agency is billed; otherwise you may need to  request reimbursement from each State to which taxes were paid. The GSA  contractor issued fleet charge card is the only Government-issued charge  card that may be used for GSA Fleet motor vehicles. For further  information on acquiring these fleet charge cards and their use, contact  the: General Services Administration, ATTN: GSA SmartPay [supreg] (QMB),  2200 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may use a Government purchase card if you do not have a  fleet charge card or if the use of such a Government purchase card is  required by your agency mission. However, the Government purchase card  does not collect motor vehicle data nor does it deduct State sales and  motor fuel taxes.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 102-34.320: OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B, contains  additional specific guidance on the management, issuance, and usage of  Government charge cards. The Appendix B guidance consolidates and  updates current Governmentwide charge card program requirements and  guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, GSA,   Department of the Treasury, and other Federal agencies. Appendix B  provides a single document to incorporate changes, new guidance, or  amendments to existing guidance, and establishes minimum requirements  and suggested best practices for Government charge card programs that  may be supplemented by individual agency policy procedures.</p>
