                            <p class="depth0">Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling on a motion by an Administrative Law Judge may be sought only as prescribed in this rule:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When interlocutory appeal may be taken. An interlocutory appeal may be permitted, in the discretion of the Commission, under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to Sec. 12.102, Sec. 12.202, or Sec. 12.305 refusing to grant a motion to disqualify a Judgment Officer or Administrative Law Judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to Sec. 12.9 suspending an attorney from participation in a reparation proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon a determination by the Administrative Law Judge certified to the Commission either in writing or on the record, that</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A ruling sought to be appealed involves a controlling question of law or policy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the issues in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unnecessary delay or expense to the parties; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The appeal is from a ruling which satisfies the conditions of paragraphs (a)(3) (i)-(iii) of this section, despite the absence of certification, and extraordinary circumstances are shown to exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure to obtain interlocutory review. An application for interlocutory review may be served and filed within ten (10) days after service of a ruling

described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4) of this section or of notice that a determination has been made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The application for interlocutory review shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the controlling questions determined by the Administrative Law Judge, and to an understanding of the extraordinary circumstances warranting interlocutory review by the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the question or issue involved in the ruling upon which the application for review is based;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the reasons why, in the opinion of the party requesting review, the ruling was erroneous and should be reversed or modified; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A copy of all papers filed by the parties that relate to the subject matter of the ruling at issue, including the order containing the ruling.
Within seven (7) days after service of the application for interlocutory review, any party may file a response in opposition to the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standard for review. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Commission will not review a ruling of an Administrative Law Judge prior to the Commission's consideration of the proceeding pursuant to subpart F of these rules. A Commission denial of an application for interlocutory review shall be without prejudice to the applying party's right to raise any argument made in the application as an issue in an appeal taken pursuant to subpart F of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proceedings not stayed. The filing of an application for interlocutory review and a grant of review shall not stay proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (or a Judgment Officer, if applicable) unless that official or the Commission shall so order. The Commission will not consider a motion for a stay unless the motion shall have first been made to the Administrative Law Judge (or, if applicable, the Judgment Officer) and denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interlocutory review by the Commission on its own motion. Nothing in this rule should be construed as restricting the Commission from acting on its own motion to review on an interlocutory basis any ruling of an Administrative Law Judge, Proceedings Officer or a Judgment Officer in any proceeding commenced pursuant to Sec. 12.26 of these rules.</p>
