                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A prisoner or parolee may submit to the National Appeals  Board a written appeal of any decision to grant (other than a decision  to grant parole on the date of parole eligibility), rescind, deny, or  revoke parole, except that any appeal of a Commission decision pursuant  to Sec.  2.17 shall be submitted as a petition for reconsideration under  Sec.  2.27.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The appeal must be filed on a form provided for that purpose  within 30 days from the date of entry of the decision that is the  subject of the appeal. The appeal must include an opening paragraph that  briefly summarizes the grounds for the appeal. The appellant shall then  list each ground separately and concisely explain the reasons supporting  each ground. Appeals that do not conform to the above requirements may  be returned at the Commission's discretion, in which case the appellant  shall have 30 days from the date the appeal is returned to submit an  appeal that complies with the above requirements. The appellant may  provide any additional information for the Commission to consider in an  addendum to the appeal. Exhibits may be attached to an appeal, but the  appellant should not attach exhibits that are copies of documents  already in the possession of the Commission. Any exhibits that are  copies of documents already in the Commission's files will not be  retained by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The National Appeals Board may: Affirm the decision of a  Regional Commissioner on the vote of a single Commissioner other than  the Commissioner who issued the decision from which the appeal is taken;  or modify or reverse the decision of a Regional Commissioner, or order a  new hearing, upon the concurrence of two Commissioners. The Commissioner  first reviewing the case may in his discretion circulate the case for  review and vote by the other Commissioners notwithstanding his own vote  to affirm the Regional Commissioner's decision. In such event, the case  shall be decided by the concurrence of two out of three votes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All Commissioners serve as members of the National Appeals  Board, and it shall in no case be an objection to a decision of the  Board that the Commissioner who issued the decision from which an appeal  is taken participated as a voting member on appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The National Appeals Board shall act within sixty days of  receipt of the appellant's papers, to affirm, modify, or reverse the  decision. Decisions of the National Appeals Board shall be final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If no appeal is filed within thirty days of the date of entry of  the original   decision, such decision shall stand as the final decision of the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeals under this section may be based upon the following  grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the guidelines were incorrectly applied as to any or all of  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Severity rating;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Salient factor score;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Time in custody;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That a decision outside the guidelines was not supported by the  reasons or facts as stated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That especially mitigating circumstances (for example, facts  relating to the severity of the offense or the prisoner's probability of  success on parole) justify a different decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That a decision was based on erroneous information, and the  actual facts justify a different decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the Commission did not follow correct procedure in deciding  the case, and a different decision would have resulted if the error had  not occurred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There was significant information in existence but not known at  the time of the hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> There are compelling reasons why a more lenient decision should  be rendered on grounds of compassion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon the written request of the Attorney General seeking review  of a decision of a Regional Commissioner, which is received within 30  days of such decision, the National Appeals Board shall reaffirm,  modify, or reverse the Regional Commissioner's decision within 60 days  of receipt of the Attorney General's request. The National Appeals Board  shall inform the Attorney General and the prisoner to whom the decision  applies in writing of its decision and the reasons therefor. In the  event the Attorney General submits new and significant information that  has not previously been disclosed to the prisoner prior to a hearing  under these rules, the National Appeals Board shall act within 60 days  to reaffirm, modify or reverse the Regional Commissioner's decision, but  shall also remand the case for a new hearing if its decision is adverse  to the prisoner. The prisoner shall have disclosure of the new  information, and the opportunity to dispute that information under Sec.   2.19(c) of this part. Following the hearing, the case shall be returned  to the National Appeals Board, together with a recommendation from the  hearing examiner, to render a final Commission decision as to the  disposition of the case.
