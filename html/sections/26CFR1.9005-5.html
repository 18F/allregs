Further, all provisions of law contained in the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent that they can apply. Thus, all the provisions of subtitle F of the Code (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent they can apply, including the provisions of law relating to assessment, collection, credit or refund, and limitations. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.9005-1 to 1.9005-4, inclusive, the term ``Act'' means the Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-321, 75 Stat. 683).
