                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When available and appropriate to verify acceptable sensitivity  and specificity, you, a manufacturer of test kits, must use a reference  panel you obtain from FDA or from an FDA designated source to test lots  of the following products. You must test each lot of the following  products, unless FDA informs you that less frequent testing is  appropriate, based on your consistent prior production of products of  acceptable sensitivity and specificity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A test kit approved for use in testing donations of human blood  and blood components for evidence of infection due to communicable  disease agents listed in Sec. 610.40(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test kit approved for use in  the diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring of this communicable disease  agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must not distribute a lot that is found to be not acceptable  for sensitivity and specificity under Sec. 610.44(a). FDA may approve  an exception or alternative to this requirement. Applicants must submit  such requests in writing. However, in limited circumstances, such  requests may be made orally and permission may be given orally by FDA.  Oral requests and approvals must be promptly followed by written  requests and written approvals.  [66 FR 31164, June 11, 2001]</p>
