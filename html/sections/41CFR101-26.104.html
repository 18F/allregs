                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purchase documents for supplies or services submitted to GSA at  or near the close of a fiscal year shall reflect actual agency  requirements and shall not be used as a means of exhausting  appropriation balances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP systems, the requisitions submitted  to GSA are not required to reflect the applicable appropriation or  fiscal year funds to be charged. The fund code entry on the requisition  simply indicates to the supply source (GSA) that funds are available to  pay the charge, thereby providing authority for the release of material  and subsequent billing. Requisitions received by GSA in purchase  authority format are normally converted to FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP  documentation so that processing can be accomplished expeditiously  through a uniform system based on the use of automated equipment.  Accordingly, primary responsibility rests with the ordering activity for  ensuring that requisitions intended to be chargeable to appropriations  expiring the last day of the fiscal year are submitted in sufficient  time for GSA to consummate the necessary action before the end of the  fiscal year. Requisitions submitted on or before the last day of the  fiscal year may be chargeable to appropriations expiring on that date  provided the ordering agency is required by law or GSA regulation to use  GSA supply sources. When the ordering agency is not required to use GSA  sources, requisitions for GSA stock items may be recorded as obligations  provided the items are intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal  year in which the need arises or to replace stock used in that fiscal  year; requests for other than GSA stock items are to be recorded as  obligations at the time GSA awards a contract for the required items. In  the latter case, GSA procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA  publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, should be used as a guide for  timely submission of these requisitions. The leadtimes referred to  relate to the number of days between submission of a requisition and  actual delivery of the items involved. While this may furnish some  guidance to requisitioners, there is no direct relationship between  those leadtimes and the time it takes for GSA to make an award of a  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> End-of-year submission of requisitions which require GSA to  award a contract not later than the last day of the fiscal year in order  to obligate the appropriation or funds of the ordering agency will be  annotated to indicate that GSA procurement of the requested items must  be accomplished not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which  the requisitions are submitted. For example, a FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP  requisition should be prepared to include Document Identifier Code A0E  or A05 and reflect the annotation in the ``Remarks'' block. With this  information GSA will attempt to complete procurement action before the  end of the fiscal year. When a requistion is received too late to permit  GSA to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year,  the requisitioning activity will be so notified and requested to furnish  instructions regarding the action to be taken. Based on these  instructions, procurement action will be taken or the requisition will  be canceled and returned to the ordering activity.
