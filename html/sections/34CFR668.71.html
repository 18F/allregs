An eligible  institution is deemed to have engaged in substantial misrepresentation  when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or any  ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible  institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing,  advertising, recruiting or admissions services, makes a substantial  misrepresentation about the nature of its educational program, its  financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Substantial  misrepresentations are prohibited in all forms, including those made in  any advertising, promotional materials, or in the marketing or sale of  courses or programs of instruction offered by the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following definitions apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth2">Misrepresentation: Any false, erroneous or misleading statement an  eligible institution, one of its representatives, or any ineligible  institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution  has an agreement to provide educational programs, or to provide  marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services makes directly  or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the  public, or to an accrediting agency, to   a State agency, or to the Secretary. A misleading statement includes any  statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive. A statement is  any communication made in writing, visually, orally, or through other  means. Misrepresentation includes the dissemination of a student  endorsement or testimonial that a student gives either under duress or  because the institution required the student to make such an endorsement  or testimonial to participate in a program.</p><p class="depth2">Prospective student: Any individual who has contacted an eligible  institution for the purpose of requesting information about enrolling at  the institution or who has been contacted directly by the institution or  indirectly through advertising about enrolling at the institution.</p><p class="depth2">Substantial misrepresentation: Any misrepresentation on which the  person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has  reasonably relied, to that person's detriment.
