                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual leave accrues at the rate of 1 day (8 hours) for each full biweekly pay period for an employee who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301, who is employed for the full pay period, and who--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Holds a position in the Senior Executive Service (SES) which is subject to 5 U.S.C. 5383; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Holds a senior-level (SL) or scientific or professional (ST) position which is subject to 5 U.S.C. 5376.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The head of an agency may request that OPM authorize an annual leave accrual rate of 1 full day (8 hours) for each biweekly pay period for additional categories of employees who are covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301 and who hold positions that are determined by OPM to be equivalent to positions subject to the pay systems under 5 U.S.C. 5383 or 5376. Such a request must include documentation that the affected pay system is equivalent to the SES or SL/ST pay system because it meets all three of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pay rates are established under an administratively determined (AD) pay system that was created under a separate statutory authority. If an AD position has a single rate of pay established under an authority outside of 5 U.S.C. chapters 51 and 53, that single rate (excluding locality pay) must be higher than the rate for GS-15, step 10 (excluding locality pay). If an AD position is paid within a rate range established under an authority outside of 5 U.S.C. chapters 51 and 53, the minimum rate of the rate range (excluding locality pay) must be at least equal to the minimum rate for the SES and SL/ST pay systems (120 percent of the rate for GS-15, step 1, excluding locality pay), and the maximum rate of the rate range (excluding locality pay) must be at least equal to the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Covered positions are equivalent to a ``Senior Executive Service position'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(2), a senior-level position (i.e., a non-executive position that is classified above

GS-15, such as a high-level special assistant or a senior attorney in a highly-specialized field who is not a manager, supervisor, or policy advisor), or a scientific or professional position as described in 5 U.S.C. 3104; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Covered positions are subject to a performance appraisal system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, or other applicable legal authority, for planning, monitoring, developing, evaluating, and rewarding employee performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If OPM approves an agency's request to cover additional categories of employees, the higher annual leave accrual rate will become effective for the pay period during which OPM approves the agency's request. Agencies must credit annual leave at the 8-hour accrual rate for affected employees who are employed for the full pay period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee who moves to a position not covered by this section will no longer be entitled to the higher annual leave accrual rate established under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, except as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6303(a). Upon movement to a noncovered position, an employee's annual leave accrual rate must be determined based on his or her years of creditable service, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6303(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unused annual leave accrued by an employee while serving in a position subject to one of the pay systems under 5 U.S.C. 5383 (Senior Executive Service) or 5 U.S.C. 5376 (Senior-Level and Scientific or Professional) or 10 U.S.C. 1607(a) (Intelligence Senior Level), shall accumulate for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 90 days (720 hours) at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period (or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods) occurring in a calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When an employee in a position outside of those listed in paragraph (e) of this section moves to a position covered by paragraph (e) of this section, any annual leave accumulated prior to movement shall remain to the employee's credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual leave accumulated prior to movement to a position covered by paragraph (e) of this section that is in excess of the amount allowed for the former position by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), or (c) and that is not used by the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period in the next leave year shall be subject to forfeiture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an employee serves less than a full pay period in a position listed in paragraph (e) of this section, only that portion of accrued annual leave that is attributable to service in such a position shall be subject to the 90-day (720-hour) limitation on accumulation of annual leave. Annual leave accrued during the remainder of the pay period shall be subject to the limitations in 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), and (c), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When an employee covered by paragraph (e) of this section moves to a position not covered by paragraph (e) of this section, any annual leave accumulated while serving in the former position that is in excess of the amount allowed for the position by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), or (c) shall remain to the employee's credit and shall be subject to reduction under procedures identical to those described in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An employee in the Senior Executive Service who, as of the first day of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, has accumulated annual leave in excess of 90 days (720 hours) is entitled to retain that leave as a personal leave ceiling. The leave shall be credited to the employee and shall be subject to reduction in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual leave credited to an employee shall be based on the amount of annual leave accumulated by the employee as of the end of the pay period preceding the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994. The credited leave shall exclude--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any annual leave restored to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any annual leave advanced to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d) that had not yet been earned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual leave credited to an employee that is in excess of 90 days (720 hours) shall be subject to reduction in the same manner as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the employee's accumulated annual leave is equal to or less than 90 days (720 hours). For the 1994 leave year, 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) shall be applied only for leave earned and used

between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Agencies shall notify affected employees and maintain records on the accumulated annual leave credited to each employee under paragraph (h) of this section and on any reductions in the credited annual leave made under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c). If the employee transfers to another agency, such records shall be provided to the gaining agency.
