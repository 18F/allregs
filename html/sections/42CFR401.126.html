                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specific exemptions from disclosure. Pursuant to paragraph (b)  of 5 U.S.C. 552, certain classes of records are exempt from disclosure.  For some examples of the kinds of materials which are exempt, see  subpart F of the public information regulation of the Department of  Health and Human Services (45 CFR part 5) and the appendix to that  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> of 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, which exempts from the  requirement for disclosure matters that are exempted from disclosure by  statute, provided that such statute requires that the matters be  withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on  the issue, or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers  to particular types of matter to be withheld:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reports described in sections 1106 (d) and (e) of the Social  Security Act shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the  provisions of sections   1106 (d) and (e). Sections 1106 (d) and (e) provide for public  inspection of certain official reports dealing with the operation of the  health programs established by titles XVIII and XIX of the Social  Security Act (Medicare and Medicaid), but require that program  validation survey reports and other formal evaluations of providers of  services shall not identify individual patients, individual health care  practitioners, or other individuals. Section 1106(e) further requires  that none of the reports shall be made public until the contractor or  provider whose performance is being evaluated has had a reasonable  opportunity to review that report and to offer comments. See Sec.  401.133 (b) and (c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section,  CMS may not disclose any accreditation survey or any information  directly related to the survey (including corrective action plans) made  by and released to it by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of  Healthcare Organizations, the American Osteopathic Association or any  other national accreditation organization that meets the requirements of  Sec. 488.5 or Sec. 493.506 of this chapter. Materials that are  confidential include accreditation letters and accompanying  recommendations and comments prepared by an accreditation organization  concerning the entities it surveys.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> CMS may release the accreditation survey of any  home health agency; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> CMS may release the accreditation survey and other information  directly related to the survey (including corrective action plans) to  the extent the survey and information relate to an enforcement action  (for example, denial of payment for new admissions, civil money  penalties, temporary management and termination) taken by CMS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax returns and return information defined in section 6103 of  the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1976,  shall not be disclosed except as authorized by the Internal Revenue  Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of exemption. Neither 5 U.S.C. 552 nor this regulation  directs the withholding of any record or information, except to the  extent of the prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section. Except for  material required to be withheld under the statutory provisions  incorporated in paragraph (b) of this section or under another statute  which meets the standards in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), materials exempt from  mandatory disclosure will nevertheless be made available when this can  be done consistently with obligations of confidentiality and  administrative necessity. The disclosure of materials or records under  these circumstances in response to a specific request, however, is of no  precedent force with respect to any other request.
