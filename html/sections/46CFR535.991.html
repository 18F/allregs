                            <p class="depth0">This section displays the control number assigned to information  collection requirements of the Commission in this part by the Office of  Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,  Pub. L. 104-13. The Commission intends that this section comply with the  requirements of section 3507(a)(3) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, which  requires that agencies display a current control number assigned by the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each agency  information collection requirement in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Current OMB</p><p class="depth0">Section                            control No. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 535.101 through 535.902.................................       3072-0045 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 535--Information Form and Instructions</p><p class="depth0">Information Form Instructions</p><p class="depth0">1. All agreements and modifications to agreements between or among  ocean common carriers identified in 46 CFR 535.502 must be accompanied  by a completed Information Form to the full extent required in sections  I through V of this Form. Sections I and V must be completed by all such  agreements. In addition, sections II, III and IV must be completed, as  applicable, in accordance with the authority contained in each  agreement. Where an agreement containing multiple authorities is subject  to duplicate reporting requirements in the various sections of this  Form, the parties may provide only one response so long as the reporting  requirements within each section are fully addressed. The Information  Form specifies the data and information which must be reported for each  section and the format in which it must be provided. If a party to an  agreement is unable to supply a complete response to any item of this  Form, that party   shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise  data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for  noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required information.  For purposes of this Form, if one of the agreement signatories is a  joint service operating under an effective agreement, that signatory  shall respond to the Form as a single agreement party.</p><p class="depth0">2. For clarification of the agreement terminology used in this Form,  the parties may refer to the definitions provided in 46 CFR 535.104. In  addition, the following definitions shall apply for purposes of this  Form: liner movement means the carriage of liner cargo by liner  operators; liner cargo means cargo carried on liner vessels in a liner  service; liner operator means a vessel-operating common carrier engaged  in liner service; liner vessel means a vessel used in a liner service;  liner service means a definite, advertised schedule of sailings at  regular intervals; and TEU means a unit of measurement equivalent to one  20-foot shipping container. Further, when used in this Form, the terms  ``entire geographic scope of the agreement'' or ``agreement-wide'' refer  to the combined U.S. inbound trade and/or the combined U.S. outbound  trade as such trades apply to the geographic scope of the agreement, as  opposed to the term ``sub-trade,'' which is defined for reporting  purposes as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port  range and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement.  Whether required on a combined trade basis or a sub-trade basis, the  U.S. inbound trade (or sub-trades) and the U.S. outbound trade (or sub- trades) shall always be stated separately.</p><p class="depth0">Section I</p><p class="depth0">Section I applies to all agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502.  Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 through 4 of this  section. The authorities listed in part 4 of this section do not  necessarily include all of the authorities that must be set forth in an  agreement filed under the Act. The specific authorities between the  parties to an agreement, however, must be set forth, clearly and  completely, in a filed agreement in accordance with 46 CFR 535.402.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1</p><p class="depth0">State the full name of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement describing the specific purpose(s) of  the agreement pertaining to the parties' business activities as ocean  common carriers in the foreign commerce of the United States, and the  commercial or other relevant circumstances within the geographic scope  of the agreement that led the parties to enter into the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 3</p><p class="depth0">List all effective agreements that cover all or part of the  geographic scope of this agreement, and whose parties include one or  more of the parties to this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(A)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to discuss, or  agree upon, whether on a binding basis under a common tariff or a non- binding basis, any kind of rate or charge.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(B)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to establish a  joint service.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(C)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to pool cargo  traffic or revenues.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(D)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to discuss, or  agree on, any service contract matter.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(E)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to discuss or  agree on capacity rationalization as defined in 46 CFR 535.104(e).</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(F)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement contains provisions that place  conditions or restrictions on the parties' agreement participation, and/ or use or offering of competing services within the geographic scope of  the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(G)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to charter or  use vessel space in exchange for compensation or services. This  authority does not include capacity rationalization as referred to in  part 4(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(H)</p><p class="depth0">Identify whether the agreement authorizes the parties to rationalize  sailings or services relating to a schedule of ports, the frequency of  vessel calls at ports, or the size and capacity of vessels for  deployment. This authority does not include the establishment of a joint  service or capacity rationalization as referred to in parts 4(B) and  4(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Section II</p><p class="depth0">Section II applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502(a)  that contain any of the following authorities: a) the charter or use of  vessel space in exchange for compensation or   services; or b) the rationalization of sailings or services relating to  a schedule of ports, the frequency of vessel calls at ports, or the size  and capacity of vessels for deployment. Such authorities do not include  the establishment of a ``joint service,'' nor ``capacity  rationalization'' as these terms are defined in 46 CFR 535.104 (o) and  (e). Parties to agreements identified in this section must complete all  items in part 1.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the most recent 12-month period for which complete data are  available, provide the number of vessel calls each party made at each  port for its liner services that would be covered by the agreement  within the entire geographic scope of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  anticipated or planned to be implemented when the agreement goes into  effect, in the number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner  services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire  geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of  the significant change and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls  at the port for the liner service that would be subject to the change.  For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to an increase or  a decrease in the number of vessel calls at a port for a fixed,  seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change  excludes an incidental or temporary alteration in the number of vessel  calls at a port, or an operational change in vessel calls that would  have little or no impact on the number of vessel calls at a port. If no  significant change is anticipated or planned, it shall be noted with the  term ``none'' in response to part 1(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Section III</p><p class="depth0">Section III applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502 that  contain the authority to discuss or agree on capacity rationalization as  defined in 46 CFR 535.104(e). Parties to such agreements must complete  parts 1 and 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. For the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are  available, provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each  of its liner services that would be covered by the agreement within the  entire geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S.  inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the  agreement. For purposes of this Form, vessel capacity means a party's  total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by  it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from  the continent of North America for each of its liner services that would  be covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all  the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar  quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each  party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total  liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the  agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the  amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non- containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in  calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be  specified clearly and consistently applied.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide the percentage of vessel capacity utilization for each party  for each of its liner services that would be covered by the agreement  within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, corresponding to  the figures and time period used in part 1(A) of this section, stated  separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the  geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Form, the  percentage of vessel capacity utilization means a party's total volume  of liner cargo, for each of its liner services that would be covered by  the agreement, carried on any vessel space counted under part 1(A) of  this section, divided by its total vessel capacity as defined and  derived in part 1(A) of this section, which quotient is multiplied by  100.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1(C)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  anticipated or planned to be implemented when the agreement goes into  effect, in the amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner  services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire  geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of  and the reasons for the significant change and its effects on the liner  service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such service that  would be subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant  change refers to the removal from or addition to a liner service of  vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite  period of time. A significant change excludes instances when vessels may  be temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or  when vessel space may be temporarily altered, or when vessels are  removed from a liner service and vessels of similar capacity are  substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels or vessel  space that would   have little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a  liner service or a trade. If no significant change is anticipated or  planned, it shall be noted with the term ``none'' in response to part  1(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the most recent 12-month period for which complete data are  available, provide the number of vessel calls each party made at each  port for its liner services that would be covered by the agreement  within the entire geographic scope of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  anticipated or planned to be implemented when the agreement goes into  effect, in the number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner  services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire  geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of  the significant change and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls  at the port for the liner service that would be subject to the change.  For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to an increase or  a decrease in the number of vessel calls at a port for a fixed,  seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change  excludes an incidental or temporary alteration in the number of vessel  calls at a port, or an operational change in vessel calls that would  have little or no impact on the number of vessel calls at a port. If no  significant change is anticipated or planned, it shall be noted with the  term ``none'' in response to part 2(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Section IV</p><p class="depth0">Section IV applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502 that  contain any of the following authorities: a) the discussion of, or  agreement upon, whether on a binding basis under a common tariff or a  non-binding basis, any kind of rate or charge; b) the establishment of a  joint service; c) the pooling or division of cargo traffic, earnings, or  revenues and/or losses; or d) the discussion of, or agreement on, any  service contract matter. Parties to such agreements must complete parts  1 through 5 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1</p><p class="depth0">1. For the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are  available, provide the market shares of all liner operators for the  entire geographic scope of the agreement and in each sub-trade within  the scope of the agreement. A joint service shall be treated as a single  liner operator, whether it is an agreement line or a non-agreement line.  Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all liner movements between each  U.S. port range within the scope of the agreement and each foreign  country within the scope of the agreement. Where the agreement covers  both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound  market shares shall be shown separately.</p><p class="depth0">2. U.S. port ranges are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Atlantic and Gulf--Includes ports along the eastern seaboard and  the Gulf of Mexico from the northern boundary of Maine to Brownsville,  Texas. Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their  connecting waterways, all ports in the State of New York on the St.  Lawrence River, and all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands.</p><p class="depth0">b. Pacific--Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii,  California, Oregon, and Washington. Also includes all ports in Guam,  American Samoa, Northern Marianas, Johnston Island, Midway Island, and  Wake Island.</p><p class="depth0">3. An application may be filed for a waiver of the definition of  ``sub-trade'' under the procedures described in 46 CFR 535.504. In any  such application, the burden shall be on the parties to show that their  marketing and pricing practices have been done by ascertainable multi- country regions rather than by individual countries or, in the case of  the United States, by broader areas than the port ranges defined herein.  The parties must further show that, though operating individually, they  were nevertheless applying essentially similar regional practices.</p><p class="depth0">4. The formula for calculating market share in the entire agreement  scope or in a sub-trade is as follows: The total amount of liner cargo  carried on each liner operator's liner vessels in the entire agreement  scope or in the sub-trade during the most recent calendar quarter for  which complete data are available, divided by the total liner movements  in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the same  calendar quarter, which quotient is multiplied by 100. The calendar  quarter used must be clearly identified. The market shares held by non- agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be provided, stated  separately in the format indicated.</p><p class="depth0">5. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the  parties in the entire agreement scope during the calendar quarter was  containerized, only containerized liner movements (measured in TEUs)  must be used for determining market share. If 50 percent or more of the  total liner cargo carried by the parties was non-containerized, only  non-containerized liner movements must be used for determining market  share. The unit of measurement used in calculating amounts of non- containerized cargo must be specified clearly and applied consistently.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2</p><p class="depth0">1. For each party that served all or any part of the geographic  scope of the agreement during all or any part of the most recent 12- month period for which complete data are available, provide each party's  total liner revenues within the geographic scope, total liner cargo  carried within the geographic scope, and average revenue. For purposes  of this Form, total liner revenues means the total revenues, in U.S.  dollars, of each party corresponding to its total cargo carried for its  liner services that would fall under the agreement, inclusive of all  ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a  through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges  for inland cargo carriage. Average revenue shall be calculated as the  quotient of each party's total liner revenues within the geographic  scope divided by its total cargo carried within the geographic scope.</p><p class="depth0">2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all  the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month  period was containerized, each party shall report only its total  carryings of containerized liner cargo (measured in TEUs) within the  geographic scope, total revenues generated by its carriage of  containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per TEU. When 50 percent  or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the  geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month period was non- containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of non- containerized liner cargo (specifying the unit of measurement used),  total revenues generated by its carriage of non-containerized liner  cargo, and average revenue per unit of measurement. When the agreement  covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and  outbound data shall be stated separately.</p><p class="depth0">Part 3(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the same 12-month period used in part 2 of this section, provide  a list, for the entire geographic scope of the agreement, of the top 10  liner commodities (including commodities not subject to tariff  publication) carried by all the parties for their liner services that  would fall under the agreement. For purposes of this Form, commodities  shall be identified at the 4-digit level of customarily used commodity  coding schedules. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo  carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement  during the 12-month period was containerized, this list shall include  only containerized commodities. When 50 percent or more of the total  liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the  agreement during the 12-month period was non-containerized, this list  shall include only non-containerized commodities. When the agreement  covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and  outbound data shall be stated separately.</p><p class="depth0">Part 3(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide the cargo volume and revenue results for each party for each  of the major commodities listed in part 3(A) of this section,  corresponding to the same 12-month period and unit of measurement used.  For purposes of this Form, revenue results means the revenues, in U.S.  dollars, earned by each party on the cargo volume of each major  commodity listed in part 3(A) of this section, inclusive of all ocean  freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a through  intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges for  inland cargo carriage. If a party has no cargo volume and revenue  results for a commodity listed in part 3(A) of this section, it shall be  noted by using a zero for that party in response to part 3(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the same calendar quarter used in part 1 of this section,  provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each of its  liner services that would fall under the agreement within the entire  geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S.  inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the  agreement. For purposes of this Form, vessel capacity means a party's  total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by  it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from  the continent of North America for each of its liner services that would  fall under the agreement. When 50 percent or more of the total liner  cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the  agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, the amount(s)  of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50  percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in  the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was  non-containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall  be reported in non-containerized units of measurement. The unit of  measurement used in calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel  capacity must be specified clearly and consistently applied.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide the percentage of vessel capacity utilization for each party  for each of its liner services that would fall under the agreement  within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, corresponding to  the figures and time period used in part 4(A) of this section, stated  separately for the U.S. inbound and   outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement.  For purposes of this Form, the percentage of vessel capacity utilization  means a party's total volume of liner cargo, for each of its liner  services that would fall under the agreement, carried on any vessel  space counted under part 4(A) of this section, divided by its total  vessel capacity as defined and derived in part 4(A) of this section,  which quotient is multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(C)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  anticipated or planned for when the agreement goes into effect, in the  amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner services that would  fall under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and reasons for the  significant change and its effects on the liner service and the total  amount of vessel capacity for such service that would be subject to the  change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to the  removal from or addition to a liner service of vessels or vessel space  for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A  significant change excludes instances when vessels may be temporarily  repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or when vessel  space may be temporarily altered, or when vessels are removed from a  liner service and vessels of similar capacity are substituted. It also  excludes operational changes in vessels or vessel space that would have  little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner  service or a trade. If no significant change is anticipated or planned,  it shall be noted with the term ``none'' in response to part 4(C) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 5(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the same 12-month period used in parts 2 and 3 of this section,  provide the number of vessel calls each party made at each port for its  liner services that would fall under the agreement within the entire  geographic scope of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Part 5(B)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  anticipated or planned for when the agreement goes into effect, in the  number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner services that  would fall under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement.

Appendix B to Part 535--Monitoring Report and Instructions</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring Report Instructions</p><p class="depth0">1. All agreements between or among ocean common carriers identified  in 46 CFR 535.702(a) must submit completed Monitoring Reports to the  full extent required in sections I through III of this Report. Sections  I and II must be completed, as applicable, in accordance with the  authority contained in each agreement. Section III must be completed by  all agreements subject to Monitoring Report requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where an agreement containing multiple authorities is subject to  duplicate reporting requirements in the various sections of this Report,  the parties may provide only one response so long as the reporting  requirements within each section are fully addressed. The Monitoring  Report specifies the data and information which must be reported for  each section and the format in which it must be provided. If a party to  an agreement is unable to supply a complete response to any item of this  Report, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an  explanation of why precise data are not available) or a   detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to  obtain the required information. For purposes of this Report, if one of  the agreement signatories is a joint service operating under an  effective agreement, that signatory shall respond to the Report as a  single agreement party.</p><p class="depth0">3. For clarification of the agreement terminology used in this  Report, the parties may refer to the definitions provided in 46 CFR  535.104. In addition, the following definitions shall apply for purposes  of this Report: liner movement means the carriage of liner cargo by  liner operators; liner cargo means cargo carried on liner vessels in a  liner service; liner operator means a vessel-operating common carrier  engaged in liner service; liner vessel means a vessel used in a liner  service; liner service means a definite, advertised schedule of sailings  at regular intervals; and TEU means a unit of measurement equivalent to  one 20-foot shipping container. Further, when used in this Report, the  terms ``entire geographic scope of the agreement'' or ``agreement-wide''  refer to the combined U.S. inbound trade and/or the combined U.S.  outbound trade as such trades apply to the geographic scope of the  agreement, as opposed to the term ``sub-trade,'' which is defined for  reporting purposes as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S.  port range and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement.  Whether required on a combined trade basis or a sub-trade basis, the  U.S. inbound trade (or sub-trades) and the U.S. outbound trade (or sub- trades) shall always be stated separately.</p><p class="depth0">Section I</p><p class="depth0">Section I applies to agreements, identified in 46 CFR 535.702(a)(1),  that contain the authority to discuss or agree on capacity  rationalization as defined in 46 CFR 535.104(e). Parties to such  agreements must complete parts 1 through 3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1</p><p class="depth0">State the full name of the agreement and the agreement number  assigned by the FMC.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the amount of vessel  capacity for each party for each of its liner services that is covered  by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement,  stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable  to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report,  vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line- haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is  obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for each  of its liner services that is covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all  the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar  quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each  party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total  liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the  agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the  amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non- containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in  calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be  specified clearly and consistently applied.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(B)</p><p class="depth0">For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the percentage of vessel  capacity utilization for each party for each of its liner services that  is covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement, corresponding to the figures used in part 2(A) of this  section, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as  applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of  this Report, the percentage of vessel capacity utilization means a  party's total volume of liner cargo, for each of its liner services that  is covered by the agreement, carried on any vessel space counted under  part 2(A) of this section, divided by its total vessel capacity as  defined and derived in part 2(A) of this section, which quotient is  multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(C)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant reductions, to be  implemented under the agreement, in the amounts of vessel capacity for  the parties' liner services that are covered by the agreement within the  entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the  nature of and the reasons for the significant reduction and its effects  on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such  service that would be subject to the reduction. The narrative statement  for part 2(C) of this section shall be submitted to the Director, Bureau  of Trade Analysis, no later than 15 days after a significant reduction  in the amount of vessel capacity has been agreed upon by the parties but  prior to the implementation of the actual reduction under the agreement.  For purposes of this part, a significant reduction refers to the removal  from a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally  planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant reduction excludes  instances when vessels may be temporarily repositioned or shifted from  one service to another, or when vessel space may be temporarily altered,  or when vessels are removed from a liner service and vessels of similar  or greater capacity   are substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels or  vessel space that would have little or no impact on the amount of vessel  capacity offered in a liner service or a trade.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2(D)</p><p class="depth0">Excluding those changes already reported in part 2(C) of this  section, provide a narrative statement on any other significant changes,  implemented under the agreement during the preceding calendar quarter,  in the amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner services that  are covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and the reasons for the  significant change and its effects on the liner service and the total  amount of vessel capacity for such service that was subject to the  change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to the  addition to a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed,  seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change  excludes instances when vessels were temporarily repositioned or shifted  from one service to another, or when vessel space was temporarily  altered, or when vessels were removed from a liner service and vessels  of similar capacity were substituted. It also excludes operational  changes in vessels or vessel space that had little or no impact on the  amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade. If no  significant change was implemented, it shall be noted with the term  ``none'' in response to part 2(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 3</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes,  implemented under the agreement during the calendar quarter, in the  number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner services that  are covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of the significant change  and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls at the port for the  liner service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part,  a significant change refers to an increase or a decrease in the number  of vessel calls at a port for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite  period of time. A significant change excludes an incidental or temporary  alteration in the number of vessel calls at a port, or an operational  change in vessel calls that had little or no impact on the number of  vessel calls at a port. If no significant change was implemented, it  shall be noted with the term ``none'' in response to part 3 of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Section II</p><p class="depth0">Section II applies to agreements, identified in 46 CFR  535.702(a)(2), where the parties to the agreement hold a combined market  share, based on cargo volume, of 35 percent or more in the entire U.S.  inbound or outbound geographic scope of the agreement and the agreement  contains any of the following authorities: a) the discussion of, or  agreement upon, whether on a binding basis under a common tariff or a  non-binding basis, any kind of rate or charge; b) the establishment of a  joint service; c) the pooling or division of cargo traffic, earnings, or  revenues and/or losses; or d) the discussion of, or agreement on, any  service contract matter. Parties to such agreements must complete parts  1 through 6 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 1</p><p class="depth0">State the full name of the agreement and the agreement number  assigned by the FMC.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2</p><p class="depth0">1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the market shares of  all liner operators for the entire geographic scope of the agreement and  in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement. A joint service  shall be treated as a single liner operator, whether it is an agreement  line or a non-agreement line. Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all  liner movements between each U.S. port range within the scope of the  agreement and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement.  Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner  movements, inbound and outbound market shares shall be shown separately.</p><p class="depth0">2. U.S. port ranges are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Atlantic and Gulf--Includes ports along the eastern seaboard and  the Gulf of Mexico from the northern boundary of Maine to Brownsville,  Texas. Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their  connecting waterways, all ports in the State of New York on the St.  Lawrence River, and all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands.</p><p class="depth0">b. Pacific--Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii,  California, Oregon, and Washington. Also includes all ports in Guam,  American Samoa, Northern Marianas, Johnston Island, Midway Island, and  Wake Island.</p><p class="depth0">3. An application may be filed for a waiver of the definition of  ``sub-trade'' under the procedures described in 46 CFR 535.705. In any  such application, the burden shall be on the parties to show that their  marketing and pricing practices have been done by ascertainable multi- country regions rather than by individual countries or, in the case of  the United States, by broader areas than the port ranges defined herein.  The Commission will also consider whether the alternative definition of  ``sub-trade'' requested by the waiver application is reasonably  consistent with the definition of ``sub-trade'' applied in the original  Information Form for the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">4. The formula for calculating market share in the entire agreement  scope or in a sub-trade is as follows: The total amount of liner cargo  carried on each liner operator's liner vessels in the entire agreement  scope or in the sub-trade during the most recent calendar quarter for  which complete data are available, divided by the total liner movements  in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the same  calendar quarter, which quotient is multiplied by 100. The market shares  held by non-agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be  provided, stated separately in the format indicated.</p><p class="depth0">5. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the  parties in the entire agreement scope during the calendar quarter was  containerized, only containerized liner movements (measured in TEUs)  must be used for determining market share. If 50 percent or more of the  total liner cargo carried by the parties was non-containerized, only  non-containerized liner movements must be used for determining market  share. The unit of measurement used in calculating amounts of non- containerized cargo must be specified clearly and applied consistently.</p><p class="depth0">Part 3</p><p class="depth0">1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide each party's total  liner revenues in the entire geographic scope of the agreement, total  liner cargo carried in the entire geographic scope of the agreement, and  average revenue. For purposes of this Report, total liner revenues means  the total revenues, in U.S. dollars, of each party corresponding to its  total cargo carried for its liner services that fall under the  agreement, inclusive of all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a  port-to-port basis or a through intermodal basis; accessorial charges;  surcharges; and charges for inland cargo carriage. Average revenue shall  be calculated as the quotient of each party's total liner revenues in  the entire geographic scope divided by its total cargo carried in the  entire geographic scope.</p><p class="depth0">2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all  the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar  quarter was containerized, each party shall report only its total  carryings of containerized liner cargo (measured in TEUs) during the  calendar quarter, total revenues generated by its carriage of  containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per TEU. When 50 percent  or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the  geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non- containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of non- containerized liner cargo during the calendar quarter (specifying the  unit of measurement used), total revenues generated by its carriage of  non-containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per unit of  measurement. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound  liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated separately.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the preceding calendar quarter, provide a list, for the entire  geographic scope of the agreement, of the top 10 liner commodities  (including commodities not subject to tariff publication) carried by all  the parties for their liner services that fall under the agreement. For  purposes of this Report, commodities shall be identified at the 4-digit  level of customarily used commodity coding schedules. When 50 percent or  more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the  geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was  containerized, this list shall include only containerized commodities.  When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the  parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar  quarter was non-containerized, this list shall include only non- containerized commodities. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound  and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated  separately.</p><p class="depth0">Part 4(B)</p><p class="depth0">For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the cargo volume and  revenue results for each party for each of the major commodities listed  in part 4(A) of this section, corresponding to the same unit of  measurement used. For purposes of this Report, revenue results means the  revenues, in U.S. dollars, earned by each party on the cargo volume of  each major commodity listed in part 4(A) of this section, inclusive of  all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a  through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges  for inland cargo carriage. If a party has no cargo volume and revenue  results for a commodity listed in part 4(A) of this section, it shall be  noted by using a zero for that party in response to part 4(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 5(A)</p><p class="depth0">For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the amount of vessel  capacity for each party for each of its liner services that falls under  the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement,  stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable  to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report,  vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line- haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is  obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for   each of its liner services that falls under the agreement. When 50  percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in  the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was  containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be  reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo  carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement  during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the amount(s) of  vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non-containerized  units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in calculating the  amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be specified clearly  and consistently applied.</p><p class="depth0">Part 5(B)</p><p class="depth0">For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the percentage of vessel  capacity utilization for each party for each of its liner services that  falls under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the  agreement, corresponding to the figures used in part 5(A) of this  section, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as  applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of  this Report, the percentage of vessel capacity utilization means a  party's total volume of liner cargo, for each of its liner services that  falls under the agreement, carried on any vessel space counted under  part 5(A) of this section, divided by its total vessel capacity as  defined and derived in part 5(A) of this section, which quotient is  multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth0">Part 5(C)</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes in the  amount of vessel capacity that occurred during the preceding calendar  quarter for the parties' liner services that fall under the agreement  within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically,  explain the nature of and the reasons for the significant change and its  effects on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for  such service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part,  a significant change refers to the removal from or addition to a liner  service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or  indefinite period of time. A significant change would exclude instances  when vessels were temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service  to another, or when vessel space was temporarily altered, or when  vessels were removed from a liner service and vessels of similar  capacity were substituted. It also excludes operational changes in  vessels and vessel space that had little or no impact on the amount of  vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade. If no significant  change occurred during the calendar quarter, it shall be noted with the  term ``none'' in response to part 5(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Part 6</p><p class="depth0">Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes in the  number of vessel calls at a port that occurred during the preceding  calendar quarter for the parties' liner services that fall under the  agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement.  Specifically, explain the nature of the significant change and its  effect on the frequency of vessel calls at the port for the liner  service that was subject to the change.
