                                Sec. 121.327  Supplemental oxygen: Reciprocating engine powered
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except where supplemental oxygen is provided in accordance with Sec. 121.331, no person may operate an airplane unless supplemental oxygen is furnished and used as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The amount of supplemental oxygen required for a particular operation is determined on the basis of flight altitudes and flight duration, consistent with the operation procedures established for each operation and route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crewmembers. (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, during the entire flight time at those altitudes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a flight crewmember is required to use oxygen, he must use it continuously, except when necessary to remove the oxygen mask or other dispenser in connection with his regular duties. Standby crewmembers who are on call or are definitely going to have flight deck duty before completing the flight must be provided with an amount of supplemental oxygen equal to that provided for crewmembers on duty other than on flight deck duty. If a standby crewmember is not on call and will not be on flight deck duty during the remainder of the flight, he is considered to be a passenger for the purposes of supplemental oxygen requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Passengers. Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of oxygen, approved for passenger safety, in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For flights of more than 30 minutes duration at cabin pressure altitudes above 8,000 feet up to and including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet up to and including 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes for 30 percent of the passengers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for each passenger carried during the entire flight at those altitudes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of this subpart cabin pressure altitude means the pressure altitude corresponding with the pressure in the cabin of the airplane, and flight altitude means the altitude above sea level at which the airplane is operated. For airplanes without pressurized cabins, ``cabin pressure altitude'' and ``flight altitude'' mean the same thing.</p>
