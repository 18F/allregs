                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assumption authority for responsible entities: General. Responsible entities shall assume the responsibility for environmental review, decision-making, and action that would otherwise apply to HUD under NEPA and other provisions of law that further the purposes of NEPA, as specified in Sec. 58.5. Responsible entities that receive assistance directly from HUD assume these responsibilities by execution of a grant agreement with HUD and/or a legally binding document such as the certification contained on HUD Form 7015.15, certifying to the assumption of environmental responsibilities. When a State distributes funds to a responsible entity, the State must provide for appropriate procedures by which these responsible entities will evidence their

assumption of environmental responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Particular responsibilities of the States. (1) States are recipients for purposes of directly undertaking a State project and must assume the environmental review responsibilities for the State's activities and those of any non-governmental entity that may participate in the project. In this case, the State must submit the certification and RROF to HUD for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> States are recipients for purposes of directly undertaking a State project and must assume the environmental review responsibilities for the State's activities and those of any non-governmental entity that may participate in the project. In this case, the State must submit the certification and RROF to HUD for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> States must exercise HUD's responsibilities in accordance with Sec. 58.18, with respect to approval of a unit of local government's environmental certification and RROF for a HUD assisted project funded through the state. Approval by the state of a unit of local government's certification and RROF satisfies the Secretary's responsibilities under NEPA and the related laws cited in Sec. 58.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Particular responsibilities of Indian tribes. An Indian tribe may, but is not required to, assume responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making and action for programs authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) (other than title VIII) or section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-13a). The tribe must make a separate decision regarding assumption of responsibilities for each of these Acts and communicate that decision in writing to HUD. If the tribe assumes these responsibilities, the requirements of this part shall apply. If a tribe formally declines assumption of these responsibilities, they are retained by HUD and the provisions of part 50 of this title apply.
