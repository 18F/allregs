                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Integral File Blocks. Classified records within an integral file  block that have not been reviewed and properly exempted from  declassification, or referred to an equity holder, will be automatically  declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date  of the most recent record within the file block, except as specified in  paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of  automatic declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only  records dated within 10 years of the oldest record in the block. The  records of each Presidential Administration will be treated as an  integral file block and will be scanned for declassification review  through the RAC Project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special media records. After consultation with the Director of  the National Declassification Center and before the records are subject  to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official  may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for  classified information contained in media that make a review for  possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly. NARA,  through the NDC, will coordinate processing of referrals made in these  special media records as part of its overall prioritization strategy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Referrals. The IRC at the NDC will provide official notification  for Federal records, while the RAC Project will provide formal  notification for Presidential records. For agencies which fail to act on  their referrals after formal notification by the IRC or the RAC Project,  NARA will automatically declassify their information in accordance with  section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em> of the Order. NARA will delay  automatic declassification for up to 1 year for classified records that  have been identified by the originating agency or by NARA as having  classified information that requires referral that were not identified  by the primary reviewing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other circumstances. Information from another agency that has  not been properly identified and referred is not subject to automatic  declassification. When NARA identifies information, in accordance with  section 3.3 of the Order, that agency will have up to 1 year from the  date of formal notification to review its information for  declassification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discovery of information inadvertently not reviewed. When NARA  identifies a file series or collection in its physical and legal custody  that contains classified information over 25   years old and that was inadvertently not reviewed before the effective  date of automatic declassification, NARA must report the discovery to  the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and to the responsible  agency head or senior agency official within 90 days of discovery. ISOO,  the responsible agency, and NARA will consult on a delay of up to three  years to review the records.</p>
