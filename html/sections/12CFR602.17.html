This subpart does not affect  access to documents under the FOIA or the Privacy Act. See subpart B of  this part and part 603 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, we will not produce documents voluntarily and  employees will not appear as witnesses voluntarily in any legal  proceeding. However, in limited circumstances, the Chairman may allow  the production of documents or testimony when the Chairman decides it  would be in the best interest of FCA or the public. All privileged  documents produced under this subpart remain our property. Any employee  having information or privileged documents may disclose them only as  allowed by the Chairman.</p>
