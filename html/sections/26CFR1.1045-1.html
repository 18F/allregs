                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview of section. A partnership that holds qualified small business stock (QSB stock) (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) may elect to apply section 1045. An eligible partner (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) of a partnership that sells QSB stock, may elect to apply section 1045 if the eligible partner purchases replacement QSB stock directly or through a purchasing partnership (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). A taxpayer (other than a C corporation) that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock and purchases replacement QSB stock through a purchasing partnership may elect to apply section 1045. A section 1045 election is revocable only with the prior written consent of the Commissioner. To obtain the Commissioner's prior written

consent, the person who made the section 1045 election must submit a request for a private letter ruling. (For further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2007-1, 2007-1 CB 1 (or any applicable successor) and Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.) Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for partnerships that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for certain taxpayers other than C corporations and for eligible partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a limitation on the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under section 1045. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for partnership distributions of QSB stock to an eligible partner. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for contributions of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions of certain terms used in section 1045 and this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides reporting rules for partnerships and partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (i) of this section provides examples illustrating the provisions of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section contains the effective/applicability date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Partnership election--(1) Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock. A partnership that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045. If the partnership elects to apply section 1045, then, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4) and (d) of this section, each eligible partner shall not recognize its distributive share of any partnership section 1045 gain (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section). For this purpose, partnership section 1045 gain equals the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock reduced by the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock. A partnership that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045. If the partnership elects to apply section 1045, then, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4) and (d) of this section, each eligible partner shall not recognize its distributive share of any partnership section 1045 gain (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section). For this purpose, partnership section 1045 gain equals the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock reduced by the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The excess of the amount realized by the partnership on the sale over the total cost of all replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain. A partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain shall be in the same proportion as the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock. For this purpose, the partnership's gain from the sale of QSB stock and the partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basis adjustments--(i) Partner's interest in a partnership. The adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership shall not be increased under section 705(a)(1) by gain from a partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner as the result of a partnership election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partner's interest in a partnership. The adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership shall not be increased under section 705(a)(1) by gain from a partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner as the result of a partnership election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnership's replacement QSB stock--(A) Rule. The basis of a partnership's replacement QSB stock is reduced (in the order acquired) by the amount of gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by an eligible partner as a result of the partnership's election under section 1045. The basis adjustment with respect to any amount described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) constitutes an adjustment to the basis of the partnership's replacement QSB stock with respect to that partner only. The effect of such a basis adjustment is determined under the principles of Sec. 1.743-1(g), (h), and (j) except as modified in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A). If a partnership sells QSB stock with respect to which a basis adjustment has been made under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), and the partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the sale and purchases replacement QSB stock, the basis adjustment shall carry over to the replacement QSB stock except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). The basis adjustment that carries over to the replacement QSB stock shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the eligible partner's distributive share of the excess, if any,

of the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section from the sale of the QSB stock, over the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743 or paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). The excess amount that reduces the basis adjustment shall be accounted for as gain in accordance with Sec. 1.743-1(j)(3). See Example 5 of paragraph (i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a partnership must presume that a partner did not recognize that partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain as a result of the partnership's section 1045 election unless the partner notifies the partnership to the contrary as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. However, if a partnership knows that a particular partner is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as a C corporation, then the partnership may presume that the partner did not defer recognition of its distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, even in the absence of a notification by the partner. If a partnership makes an election under section 1045, but an eligible partner opts out of the election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and provides to the partnership the notification required under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no basis adjustments under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) are required with respect to that partner as a result of the section 1045 election by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rule. The basis of a partnership's replacement QSB stock is reduced (in the order acquired) by the amount of gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by an eligible partner as a result of the partnership's election under section 1045. The basis adjustment with respect to any amount described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) constitutes an adjustment to the basis of the partnership's replacement QSB stock with respect to that partner only. The effect of such a basis adjustment is determined under the principles of Sec. 1.743-1(g), (h), and (j) except as modified in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A). If a partnership sells QSB stock with respect to which a basis adjustment has been made under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), and the partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the sale and purchases replacement QSB stock, the basis adjustment shall carry over to the replacement QSB stock except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). The basis adjustment that carries over to the replacement QSB stock shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the eligible partner's distributive share of the excess, if any,

of the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section from the sale of the QSB stock, over the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743 or paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). The excess amount that reduces the basis adjustment shall be accounted for as gain in accordance with Sec. 1.743-1(j)(3). See Example 5 of paragraph (i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a partnership must presume that a partner did not recognize that partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain as a result of the partnership's section 1045 election unless the partner notifies the partnership to the contrary as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. However, if a partnership knows that a particular partner is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as a C corporation, then the partnership may presume that the partner did not defer recognition of its distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, even in the absence of a notification by the partner. If a partnership makes an election under section 1045, but an eligible partner opts out of the election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and provides to the partnership the notification required under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no basis adjustments under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) are required with respect to that partner as a result of the section 1045 election by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tiered-partnership rule. If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that makes an election under section 1045, the portion of the lower-tier partnership's basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated to the upper-tier partnership and any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section. Similarly, that portion of the basis of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership attributable to the basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the lower-tier partnership's replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated solely to any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Statement of adjustments. A partnership that must adjust the basis of replacement QSB stock under this paragraph (b) must attach a statement to the partnership return for the taxable year in which the partnership purchases replacement QSB stock setting forth the computation of the adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, the date(s) on which such QSB stock was acquired by the partnership, and the amount of the adjustment that is allocated to each partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Eligible partners may opt out of partnership's section 1045 election. An eligible partner may opt out of the partnership's section 1045 election with respect to QSB stock either by recognizing the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, or by making a partner section 1045 election under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section for applicable notification requirements. Opting out of a partnership's section 1045 election under this paragraph (b)(4) does not constitute a revocation of the partnership's election, and such election shall continue to apply to other partners of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice requirements--(i) Partnership notification to partners. A partnership that makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify all of its partners of the election and the purchase of replacement QSB stock, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions, and separately state each partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock under section 702. Each partner shall determine whether the partner is an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and report the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock, including gain not recognized, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partnership notification to partners. A partnership that makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify all of its partners of the election and the purchase of replacement QSB stock, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions, and separately state each partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock under section 702. Each partner shall determine whether the partner is an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and report the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock, including gain not recognized, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partner notification to partnership. Any partner that must recognize all or

part of the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain must notify the partnership, in writing, of the amount of partnership section 1045 gain that is recognized by the partner. Similarly, an eligible partner that opts out of a partnership's section 1045 election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section must notify the partnership, in writing, that the partner is opting out of the partnership's section 1045 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partner election--(1) In general--(i) Rule. An eligible partner of a partnership that sells QSB stock (selling partnership) may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by the eligible partner. An eligible partner of a selling partnership may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner (directly or through an upper-tier partnership) on the date on which the partnership acquires the replacement QSB stock (purchasing partnership). A taxpayer other than a C corporation that sells QSB stock held for more than 6 months at the time of the sale may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a purchasing partnership (including a selling partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--(i) Rule. An eligible partner of a partnership that sells QSB stock (selling partnership) may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by the eligible partner. An eligible partner of a selling partnership may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner (directly or through an upper-tier partnership) on the date on which the partnership acquires the replacement QSB stock (purchasing partnership). A taxpayer other than a C corporation that sells QSB stock held for more than 6 months at the time of the sale may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a purchasing partnership (including a selling partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. An eligible partner of a partnership that sells QSB stock (selling partnership) may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by the eligible partner. An eligible partner of a selling partnership may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner (directly or through an upper-tier partnership) on the date on which the partnership acquires the replacement QSB stock (purchasing partnership). A taxpayer other than a C corporation that sells QSB stock held for more than 6 months at the time of the sale may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a purchasing partnership (including a selling partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partner purchase of replacement QSB stock. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner of a selling partnership that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to the eligible partner's purchase of replacement QSB stock must recognize its distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB stock by the selling partnership only to the extent of the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the eligible partner (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock--(A) Partner of a selling partnership. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the eligible partner and that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to such purchase must recognize its total gain (the eligible partner's distributive share of gain from the selling partnership's sale of QSB stock and any gain taken into account under paragraph (c)(5) of this section from the sale of replacement QSB stock) only to the extent of the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the eligible partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxpayer other than a C corporation. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer other than a C corporation that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership with respect to which the taxpayer is a partner as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the taxpayer must recognize its gain from the sale of the QSB stock only to the extent of the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The excess of the amount realized by the taxpayer on the sale of the QSB

stock over the partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible partner's share of amount realized by partnership--(i) General rule. The eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the selling partnership is the amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock otherwise taken into account under section 1045) multiplied by the following fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the selling partnership is the amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock otherwise taken into account under section 1045) multiplied by the following fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The numerator of which is the eligible partner's distributive share of the partnership's realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The denominator of which is the partnership's realized gain on the sale of the QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rule modified for determining eligible partner's share of amount realized by purchasing partnership upon a sale of replacement QSB stock in certain situations--(A) No gain realized or loss realized on sale of replacement QSB stock. If a purchasing partnership does not realize a gain or realizes a loss from the sale of replacement QSB stock for which an election under this section was made for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the eligible partner's share of the amount realized is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the eligible partner had a distributive share of gain allocated to the eligible partner that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount realized by a taxpayer other than a C corporation from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer realized gain that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section; less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The eligible partner's distributive share of any loss recognized on the sale of replacement QSB stock, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Eligible partner's interest in purchasing partnership is reduced and gain realized on sale of replacement QSB stock. If an eligible partner's interest in a purchasing partnership is reduced subsequent to the sale of QSB stock and the purchasing partnership realizes a gain from the sale of the replacement QSB stock, the eligible partner's share of the amount realized upon a sale of replacement QSB stock must be determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section based on the distributive share of the partnership's realized gain that would have been allocated to the eligible partner if the eligible partner's interest in the partnership had not been reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligible partner's share of the amount realized. For purposes of determining the eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the partnership, the partnership's realized gain from the sale of QSB stock and the eligible partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partner's share of the cost of QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership. The partner's share of the cost (adjusted basis) of replacement QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership is the percentage of the partnership's future income and gain, if any, that is reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner (determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1045) with respect to the replacement QSB stock that was purchased by the partnership, multiplied by the cost of that replacement QSB stock. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of income and gain must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same item of income or gain as being reasonably expected to be allocated to more than one partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Basis adjustments--(i) Eligible partner's interest in selling partnership. Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a selling partnership that sells QSB

stock is increased by the partner's distributive share of gain without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if the selling partnership is also a purchasing partnership, the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership that sells QSB stock may be reduced under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eligible partner's interest in selling partnership. Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a selling partnership that sells QSB

stock is increased by the partner's distributive share of gain without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if the selling partnership is also a purchasing partnership, the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership that sells QSB stock may be reduced under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Replacement QSB stock. A partner's basis in any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by the partner, as well as the adjusted basis of any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by a purchasing partnership and that is treated as the partner's replacement QSB stock must be reduced (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired by the partner and purchasing partnership, as applicable) by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. If replacement QSB stock is purchased by the purchasing partnership, the purchasing partnership shall maintain its adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock without regard to any basis adjustments required by this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). The eligible partner, however, shall in computing its distributive share of income, gain, loss and deduction from the purchasing partnership with respect to the replacement QSB stock take into account the variation between the adjusted basis in the QSB stock as determined under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) and the adjusted basis determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). A partner must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, and the date(s) on which such stock was acquired. See Examples 7 and 8 of paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partner's basis in purchasing partnership interest. A partner that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a lower-tier purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increase in basis on sale of QSB stock by purchasing partnership. A partner that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner. Similarly, a partner in an upper-tier partnership that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Partner recognition of gain. At the time that either the partner or the purchasing partnership (whichever applies) sells or exchanges replacement QSB stock, the amount recognized by the partner is determined by taking into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership that holds replacement QSB stock must take into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in determining the amount recognized by the partner on a

sale of the interest in the lower-tier partnership by the upper-tier partnership or the partner's distributive share of gain from the upper-tier partnership. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for rules applicable to certain distributions of replacement QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Nonrecognition limitation--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section cannot exceed the nonrecognition limitation.

The amount of gain that the partner must recognize is determined based on the amount of gain that the partner would recognize upon a sale of the distributed replacement QSB stock for its fair market value on the date of the distribution but not to exceed the amount that was previously not recognized by the partner under section 1045 with respect to the distributed replacement QSB stock. Any gain recognized by a partner whose interest is reduced must be taken into account in determining

the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership and also taken into account in determining the partnership's adjusted basis in the QSB stock distributed to another partner under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Contribution of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership. Section 721 applies to a contribution of QSB stock to a partnership. Except as provided in section 721(b), any gain that was not recognized by the taxpayer under section 1045 is not recognized when the taxpayer contributes QSB stock to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest. Stock that is contributed to a partnership is not QSB stock in the hands of the partnership. See Example 12 of paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Definitions.

The term qualified small business stock (QSB stock) has the meaning provided in section 1202(c). The term ``QSB stock'' does not include an interest in a partnership that purchases or holds QSB stock. See Example 1 of paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replacement QSB stock. The term replacement QSB stock is any QSB stock purchased within 60 days beginning on the date of a sale of QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Eligible partner--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (g)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section, an eligible partner with respect to QSB stock is a taxpayer other than a C corporation that holds an interest in a partnership on the date the partnership acquires the QSB stock and at all times thereafter for more than 6 months until the partnership sells or distributes the QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer who acquires from a partner (other than a C corporation) by gift or at death an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is treated as having held the acquired interest in the partnership during the period the partner (other than a C corporation) held the interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tiered partnership. For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, if a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that holds QSB stock, then the upper-tier partnership's ownership of the lower-tier partnership is disregarded and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as owning the interest in the lower-tier partnership directly.

For purposes of this section, the term month(s) means a period commencing on the same numerical day of any calendar month as the day on which the QSB stock is sold and ending with the close of the day preceding the numerically corresponding day of the succeeding calendar month or, if there is no corresponding day, with the last day of the succeeding calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reporting and election rules--(1) Time and manner of making election. A partnership making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must do so on the partnership's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the sale of QSB stock occurs. A partner making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must do so on the partner's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock is taken into account by such partner under section 706. In addition, a partnership or partner making an election under section 1045 must make

A partnership making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must do so on the partnership's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the sale of QSB stock occurs. A partner making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must do so on the partner's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock is taken into account by such partner under section 706. In addition, a partnership or partner making an election under section 1045 must make

such election in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Purchases, distributions, and sales of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock by partnerships. A partnership that purchases, distributes to a partner, or sells or exchanges QSB stock or replacement QSB stock must provide information to the Commissioner and to the partnership's partners to the extent provided by the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonrecognition of gain by eligible partners. An eligible partner that does not recognize gain under section 1045 must provide information to the Commissioner to the extent provided by the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Sale of a partnership interest. On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, X, a C corporation, and Y, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, X, and Y each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 4, 2008, A sells A's interest in PRS for $500, realizing $250 of capital gain. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is not treated as QSB stock. Therefore, the sale of an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is not treated as a sale of QSB stock, and A may not elect to apply section 1045 with respect to A's $250 gain from the sale of A's interest in PRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A does not sell A's interest in PRS. Instead, PRS sells the QSB stock (QSB1 stock) for $1,500 on November 3, 2008. PRS realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 of gain to each of A, X, and Y. PRS does not make a section 1045 election. On November 30, 2008, A contributes $500 to ABC, a partnership, in exchange for a 10 percent interest in ABC. ABC then purchases QSB stock (QSB2 stock) for $5,000 on December 1, 2008. ABC has no other assets. A makes an election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and treats A's percentage interest in ABC's QSB2 stock as replacement QSB stock under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the $250 gain PRS allocated to A. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, A's share of the cost of QSB2 stock purchased by ABC is $500 (A's reasonably expected income and gain with respect to QSB2 stock, or 10 percent multiplied by the cost of the QSB2 stock, $5,000). Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A will not recognize the $250 gain PRS allocated to A, because A's share of the amount realized by PRS, $500 (the total amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB1 stock ($1,500) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of the QSB1 stock ($250) over the total gain realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB1 stock ($750)), does not exceed A's share of ABC's cost of the QSB2 stock acquired by ABC, $500. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, A must reduce A's share of ABC's basis in the QSB2 stock by $250. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, A must reduce A's basis in A's interest in ABC by $250. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, A's basis in A's interest in PRS is increased by $250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, except that A does not contribute $500 to ABC in exchange for a partnership interest. Instead, on November 30, 2008, EFG, a partnership in which A has an existing 10 percent partnership interest, purchases QSB stock for $5,000. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, A may treat A's 10 percent interest in EFG's QSB stock as replacement QSB stock with respect to the $250 of gain PRS allocated to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, except that ABC owns QSB stock that ABC purchased on November 10, 2008, and ABC does not purchase QSB stock on December 1, 2008. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ABC is not a purchasing partnership with respect to A for the QSB stock ABC purchased on November 10, 2008. A may not treat A's percentage interest in ABC's QSB stock as replacement QSB stock to defer the $250 gain PRS allocated to A, because A acquired its interest in ABC after ABC acquired the QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, except that ABC sells QSB2 stock on July 30, 2009, for $5,000. ABC realizes no gain or loss on the sale of QSB2 stock. A desires to continue to rollover the $250 gain from the sale of QSB1 stock. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, A's share of the amount realized is $500, which was A's share of the amount realized on the prior sale of QSB1 stock. Accordingly, A must elect to apply section 1045 and purchase $500 of replacement QSB stock either directly or through a purchasing partnership to continue to defer the $250 gain from the sale of QSB1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and B, an individual, each contribute $500 to UTP (upper-tier partnership) for equal partnership interests. On February 1, 2008, UTP and C, an individual, each contribute $1,000 to LTP (lower-tier partnership) for equal partnership interests. On March 1, 2008, LTP purchases QSB stock for $500. On

April 1, 2008, D, an individual, joins UTP by contributing $500 to UTP for a \1/3\ interest in UTP. On December 1, 2008, LTP sells the QSB stock for $2,000. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, A, B, and D are treated as owning an interest in LTP during the period in which each of the partners held an interest in UTP and UTP held an interest in LTP. Therefore, under paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (iii) of this section, A and B are eligible partners, and D and UTP are not eligible partners with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, C is also an eligible partner with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3. LTP realizes a gain of $1,500 on the December 1, 2008, sale of QSB stock. LTP allocates $750 of gain to each of UTP and C. UTP, in turn, allocates $250 (of the $750 of gain allocated to UTP) to each of A, B, and D. LTP makes a section 1045 election. On January 1, 2009, LTP purchases replacement QSB stock for $2,000. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, D notifies UTP that it recognizes $250 of gain and UTP notifies LTP. Because A, B, and C are eligible partners with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP, A and B may each defer $250 of LTP's section 1045 gain and C may defer $750 of LTP's section 1045 gain. LTP must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB stock by the $750 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to C and by $500 of the partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to UTP. These basis reductions are with respect to UTP (A and B) and C only. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the basis of UTP's interest in LTP attributable to the LTP's replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated to A and B. In addition, A and B each have a $250 negative basis adjustment in their respective interests in UTP. If UTP sells its interest in LTP for $1,250, A and B would each recognize $250 of gain from the sale of the LTP interest. D would not recognize any gain or loss from the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form UTP, a partnership. A and X each contribute $250 to UTP and agree to share all partnership items equally. Also, on January 1, 2008, UTP and Y, a C corporation, form LTP, a partnership. UTP and Y contribute $500 and $250, respectively, to LTP. UTP and Y agree to share all partnership items equally. LTP purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 3, 2008, LTP sells the QSB stock for $1,500. LTP realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 gain to Y and $500 gain to UTP. Of the $500 gain allocated to UTP from the sale of QSB stock, $250 is allocated to A and $250 is allocated to X. LTP purchases replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB1 stock) for $1,350 on December 15, 2008. LTP does not make an election under section 1045. Under the rules provided in paragraph (c) of this section, A makes an election under section 1045 on its timely filed return for the taxable year for which the distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB stock is taken into account by A under section 706. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A treats A's interest in replacement QSB1 stock as replacement stock with respect to A's distributive share of LTP's section 1045 gain. On March 30, 2009, LTP sells replacement QSB1 stock for $1,650. LTP realizes $300 of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 to Y and $200 to UTP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A must recognize its distributive share of gain from LTP's sale of QSB stock ($250) only to the extent of the greater of A's distributive share of LTP's gain from the sale of QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income ($0) or the amount by which A's share of the amount realized by LTP's sale of QSB stock exceeds A's share of LTP's cost of the replacement QSB1 stock, $50 (\1/3\ of $1,500, or $500, minus \1/3\ of $1,350, or $450). Because Y is not an eligible partner of LTP under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, Y must recognize its $250 distributive share of partnership gain from the sale of the QSB stock. Also, X is not an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, and it must recognize its $250 distributive share of gain from UTP attributable to UTP's distributive share of $500 of LTP's gain from the sale of QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of Y's interest in LTP is increased by $250, and the adjusted basis of UTP's interest in LTP is increased by $500. Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of X's interest in UTP is increased by $250, and the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is increased by $250. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is reduced by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was not recognized by A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the LTP's adjusted basis in replacement QSB1 stock is reduced by the $200 of gain from the sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by A, as a result of A's election under section 1045. A must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment is made, and dates the stock was acquired. LTP's adjusted basis in the replacement QSB1 stock is maintained without regard to the eligible partner's adjustment provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> On the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, LTP realizes a gain of $300, $100 of which is allocated to Y and $200 of which is allocated

to UTP. UTP allocates $100 of this gain to A. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in determining A's amount recognized upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock by LTP, A must take into account A's basis adjustment of $200. Accordingly, A recognizes a total gain of $300 upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, absent an additional section 1045 election by A or LTP. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is increased by $300 under section 705(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 4, except that UTP sells its entire interest in LTP on March 30, 2009, for $1,200. UTP realizes a gain of $200 on the sale of its interest in LTP ($1,200 amount realized less $1,000 adjusted basis) and allocates $100 of this gain to A. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in determining A's amount recognized upon the sale of UTP's interest in LTP, A must take into account A's basis adjustment of $200. Accordingly, A recognizes a total gain of $300 upon the sale of the interest in LTP. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the adjusted basis in A's interest in UTP is increased by $300 under section 705(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, X, a C corporation, and Y, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, X, and Y each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 3, 2008, PRS sells the QSB stock for $1,500. PRS realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 of gain to each of A, X, and Y. PRS purchases replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB1 stock) for $1,350 on December 15, 2008. On its timely filed return for the taxable year during which the sale of the QSB stock occurs, PRS makes an election to apply section 1045. A does not make an election to apply section 1045 with respect to the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock. PRS knows that X and Y are C corporations. On March 30, 2009, PRS sells replacement QSB1 stock for $1,650. PRS realizes $300 of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 of gain to each of A, X, and Y.

This amount must be allocated among the partners in the same proportions as the entire gain from the sale of QSB stock is allocated to the partners, \1/3\ ($200) to A, \1/3\ ($200) to X, and \1/3\ ($200) to Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because neither X nor Y is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, X and Y must each recognize its $250 distributive share of partnership gain from the sale of QSB stock. Because A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, A may defer recognition of A's $200 distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain.

Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is not increased by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was not recognized by A, but is increased by A's remaining $50 distributive share of gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> PRS must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB1 stock by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to A. This basis reduction is a reduction with respect to A only. PRS then adjusts A's distributive share of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock to reflect the effect of A's basis adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In accordance with the principles of Sec. 1.743-1(j)(3), the amount of A's gain from the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock in which A has a $200 negative basis adjustment equals $300 (A's share of PRS' gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock ($100), increased by the amount of A's negative basis adjustment for replacement QSB1 stock ($200)). Accordingly, upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, A recognizes $300 of gain, and X and Y each recognize $100 of gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 5, except that PRS purchases replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB2 stock) on April 15, 2009, for $1,150 and PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 with respect to the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, PRS' $200 basis adjustment in QSB1 stock relating to the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock carries over to the basis adjustment for QSB2 stock. This basis adjustment is an adjustment with respect to A only. The $200 basis adjustment is reduced by A's distributive share of the excess of $500 (the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i), $0, or (ii) of this section, $500 ($1,650 amount realized on the sale of QSB1 stock less $1,150 cost of replacement QSB2 stock)) over $300 (PRS' gain from the sale of QSB1 stock), or $67 ($200 ($500 minus $300) divided by 3). Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A), A must account for the $67

excess amount that reduces PRS' basis adjustment in QSB2 stock as gain in accordance with Sec. 1.743-1(j)(3). Therefore, A now has a $133 negative basis adjustment with respect to replacement QSB2 stock (($200) negative basis adjustment from the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock plus $67 positive basis adjustment from the March 30, 2009, sale of QSB1 stock). A also recognizes the $100 of gain allocated by PRS to A from the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock for total gain recognition of $167 ($100 plus $67).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 5 except that PRS does not make an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of either the QSB stock on November 3, 2008, or the QSB1 stock on March 30, 2009. However, A makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of QSB stock and treats the purchase of QSB1 stock on December 15, 2008, by PRS, as the purchase of replacement QSB stock. Additionally, A makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of QSB1 stock and treats the purchase of QSB2 stock on April 15, 2009, by PRS, as the purchase of replacement QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's distributive share of gain from the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock is $250 (A's \1/3\ interest in $750 of total PRS gain).

Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, A's adjusted basis in its interest in PRS is increased by $250. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, because PRS is a purchasing partnership, A's adjusted basis of its interest in PRS is then reduced by the deferred gain of $200. Also under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, PRS' adjusted basis in QSB1 stock is reduced by the gain not recognized of $200 and A must take into account such adjusted basis in computing A's income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to QSB1 stock.

Accordingly, A's total gain from the sale of QSB1 stock is $300. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A must recognize only $167 of A's total gain of $300, that is, the excess of A's share of the amount realized on the sale of QSB1 stock, or $550 (the total amount realized by PRS on the sale of QSB1 stock ($1,650) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of QSB1 stock ($100) over the total gain realized by PRS on the sale of QSB1 stock ($300)) minus A's share of PRS' cost of QSB2 stock, or $383 (\1/3\ of $1,150).

Because A purchased, within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for a cost equal to A's share of the partnership's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, and because A made an election pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to apply section 1045, A defers recognition of A's $250 distributive share of gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock. Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is increased by $250.

PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $1,000 and subsequently sells the QSB stock on January 31, 2010, for $3,000. PRS realizes $2,000 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $1,000 of gain to each of A and X. On February 10, 2010, PRS purchases replacement QSB stock for $2,200. On March 20, 2010, A purchases replacement QSB stock for $400. PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock and A does not opt out of PRS' section 1045 election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

This amount is allocated among the partners in the same proportions as the entire gain from the sale of the QSB stock is allocated to the partners, \1/2\ to A ($600), and \1/2\ to X ($600). Because A is an eligible partner, A defers recognition of A's $600 distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A also made an election under section 1045 and purchased, within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for $400. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, A may defer a portion of A's distributive share of the remaining gain from the partnership's sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize that remaining gain to the extent that A's share of the amount realized by PRS on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of the QSB stock that was replaced by PRS) exceeds the cost of the replacement QSB stock purchased by A during the 60-day period following the sale of the QSB stock. The amount realized by PRS on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of the QSB stock that was replaced by PRS) is $800 ($3,000 minus $2,200). Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, A's share of that amount realized is $400 ($1,000 (A's share of the realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock) / $2,000 (PRS total realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock) multiplied by $800). Because the replacement QSB stock purchased by A cost $400, A defers recognition of all of the remaining gain from the sale of the QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is not increased by the $600 gain that was not recognized pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but is increased by the $400 gain that was not recognized pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. See paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section. PRS must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB stock by the $600 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to A.

A and X each contribute $500 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $1,000. On August 2, 2008, A sells a 25 percent interest in PRS to Z. On July 10, 2009, A repurchases the 25 percent interest from Z for $500. PRS makes a timely election under section 754 for the 2008 taxable year. Under section 743(b), A has a positive basis adjustment of $250. On January 31, 2011, PRS sells the QSB stock for $3,000. PRS realizes $2,000 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $1,000 of gain to each of A and X. On February 10, 2010, PRS purchases replacement QSB stock for $3,000. PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Of the $2,000 of realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock, PRS allocates $1,000 to A and $1,000 to X. However, A has a positive basis adjustment of $250 under section 743(b) as a result of the purchase of the 25 percent interest in PRS from Z; therefore, A's share of the gain is reduced to $750. Because A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, A may defer recognition of A's distributive share of gain from the sale of the QSB stock subject to the nonrecognition limitation described in paragraph (d) of this section. The smallest percentage interest that A held in PRS capital during the time that PRS held the QSB stock is 25 percent. Under the nonrecognition limitation, A may not defer more than 25 percent of the partnership gain realized from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to any basis adjustment under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than a basis adjustment described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). Because the partnership's realized gain determined without regard to A's basis adjustment under section 743(b) is $2,000, A may defer recognition of $500 (25 percent of $2,000) of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize the remaining $250 of that gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A and X each contribute $1,500 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $3,000. On May 1, 2008, when the QSB stock has appreciated in value to $4,000, A contributes $1,000 to PRS, increasing A's interest in PRS capital to 60 percent. On June 1, 2011, when the QSB stock is still worth $4,000, PRS makes a liquidating distribution of $3,000 worth of QSB stock to A. Under section 732, A's basis in the distributed QSB stock is $2,500. A sells the QSB stock on August 4, 2011, for $6,000, realizing a gain of $3,500 (none of which is treated as ordinary income). A purchases replacement QSB stock on August 30, 2011, for $5,500, and makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the August 4, 2011, sale of QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, A is treated as having acquired the distributed QSB stock in the same manner as PRS and as having held the QSB stock since February 1, 2008, its original issue date. Because A purchased, within 60 days of A's sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock, A is eligible to defer a portion of A's gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize gain, however, to the extent that A's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, $6,000, exceeds the cost of the replacement QSB stock purchased by A during the 60-day period beginning on the date of the sale of the QSB stock, $5,500. Accordingly, A must recognize $500 of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A defers recognition of the remaining $3,000 of gain to the extent that such gain does not exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, A's nonrecognition limitation with respect to the sale of the QSB stock is A's section 1045 amount realized with respect to the stock, reduced by A's section 1045 adjusted basis with respect to the stock. A's amount realized from the sale is the product of A's amount realized from the sale, $6,000; and a fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The numerator of which is A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The denominator of which is A's percentage interest in that type of partnership QSB stock immediately after the distribution, 75 percent (the value of the stock distributed to A, $3,000, divided by the value of all QSB stock of that type acquired by PRS, $4,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Therefore, A's section 1045 amount realized is $4,000 ($6,000 multiplied by 50/75). Because PRS distributed the QSB stock to A in liquidation of A's interest in PRS, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of PRS' basis in all of the QSB stock of the type distributed, $3,000; A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to QSB stock of the type distributed, 50 percent; and the percentage of the distributed QSB stock that was sold by A, 100 percent. Therefore, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is $1,500 (the product of $3,000, 50 percent, and 100 percent)) and A's nonrecognition limitation amount on the sale of the QSB stock is $2,500 ($4,000 section 1045 amount realized minus $1,500 section 1045 adjusted basis). Accordingly, A defers recognition of $2,500 of the remaining $3,000 gain from the sale of the QSB stock and must recognize $500 of the remaining $3,000 gain. Accordingly, A's total gain recognized from the sale of the QSB stock is $1,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $3,000 (cost of the replacement QSB stock, $5,500, reduced by the gain not recognized under section 1045, $2,500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 10, except that, on June 1, 2011, PRS distributes only $2,000 of the QSB stock to A, reducing A's interest in PRS capital from 60 percent to 33 percent. PRS' basis in the distributed QSB stock is $1,500. On November 1, 2011, A sells for $2,500 the QSB stock distributed by PRS to A and purchases, within 60 days of the date of sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for $2,500. A makes a timely election to apply section 1045 with respect to A's sale of the distributed QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 732, A's basis in the distributed QSB stock is $1,500. Therefore, A realizes a gain on the sale of the distributed QSB stock of $1,000. Because A made an election to apply section 1045 to the sale, and because A purchased, within 60 days of A's sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock at a cost equal to the amount realized on the sale of the distributed QSB stock, A defers recognition of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock to the extent that such gain does not exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the nonrecognition limitation with respect to A's sale of the QSB stock is A's section 1045 amount realized reduced by A's section 1045 adjusted basis. Because PRS did not distribute all of the particular type of QSB stock and the distribution of the QSB stock to A was not in liquidation of A's interest in PRS, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section A's section 1045 amount realized is $1,250 (A's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock, $2,500, multiplied by A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of the partnership's basis in the QSB stock

sold by the partner, $1,500, and A's smallest percentage interest in the partnership capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent. Therefore, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is $750 (50 percent of $1,500), and A's nonrecognition limitation amount on the sale of the QSB stock is $500 ($1,250 section 1045 amount realized minus $750 section 1045 adjusted basis). As this amount is less than the amount of gain that A is eligible to defer under section 1045, $1,000, A defers recognition of only $500 of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize the remaining $500 of that gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $2,000 (cost of the replacement QSB stock, $2,500, reduced by the gain not recognized under section 1045, $500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, B, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, B, and X each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. On February 1, 2008, PRS purchases QSB stock for $750. PRS sells the QSB stock on November 3, 2008, for $1,050. PRS realizes $300 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 of gain to each of its partners. PRS informs the partners that it does not intend to make an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of the QSB stock. Each partner's share of the amount realized from the sale of the QSB stock is $350. On November 30, 2008, A, an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, purchases replacement QSB stock for $350 and makes a section 1045 election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Subsequently, A transfers the replacement QSB stock to ABC, a partnership, in exchange for an interest in ABC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because A purchased within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for a cost equal to A's share of the partnership's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, and because A made a valid election to apply section 1045 with respect to A's share of the gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock, A does not recognize A's $100 distributive share of the gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock. Before the contribution of the replacement QSB stock to ABC, A's adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock is $250 ($350 cost minus $100 nonrecognition amount). A does not recognize gain upon the contribution of QSB stock to ABC under section 721(a). Upon the contribution of the replacement QSB stock to ABC, A's basis in the ABC partnership interest is $250, and ABC's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $250. However, the replacement QSB stock does not qualify as QSB stock in ABC's hands. Neither A nor ABC will be eligible to defer gain under section 1045 on a subsequent sale of the replacement QSB stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date/applicability--In general.
