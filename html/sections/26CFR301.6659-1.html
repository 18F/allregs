                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Additions treated as tax. Except as otherwise provided in the  Code, any reference in the Code to ``tax'' shall be deemed also to be a  reference to any addition to the tax, additional amount, or penalty  imposed by chapter 68 of the Code with respect to such tax. Such  additions to the tax, additional amounts, and penalties shall become  payable upon notice and demand therefor and shall be assessed,  collected, and paid in the same manner as taxes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additions to tax for failure to file return or pay tax. Any  addition under section 6651 or section 6653 to a tax shall be considered  a part of such tax for the purpose of the assessment and collection of  such tax. For applicability of deficiency procedures to additions to the  tax, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deficiency procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Addition to the tax for failure to  file tax return. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subchapter B, chapter 63, of the Code (deficiency  procedures) applies to the additions to the income estate, gift, and  chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes imposed by section 6651 for failure to  file a tax return to the same extent that it applies to such taxes.  Accordingly, if there is a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) in  the tax (apart from the addition to the tax) where a return has not been  timely filed, deficiency procedures apply to the addition to the tax  under section 6651. If there is no deficiency in the tax where a return  has not been timely filed, the addition to the tax under section 6651  may be assessed and collected without deficiency procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A filed his income tax return for the calendar year 1955  on May 15, 1956, not having been granted an extension of time for such  filing. His failure to file on time was not due to reasonable cause. The  return showed a liability of $1,000 and it was determined that A is  liable under section 6651 for an addition to such tax of $50 (5 percent  a month for 1 month). The provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63  (deficiency procedures) do not apply to the assessment and collection of  the addition to the tax since such provisions are not applicable to the  tax with respect to which such addition was asserted, there being no  statutory deficiency for purposes of section 6211.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 and assume further  that a deficiency of $500 in tax and a further $25 addition to the tax  under section 6651 is asserted against A for the calendar year 1955.  Thus, the total addition to the tax under section 6651 is $75. Since the  provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 are applicable to the $500  deficiency, they likewise apply to the $25 addition to the tax asserted  with respect to such deficiency (but not to the $50 addition to the tax  under example 1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additions to the tax for negligence or fraud. Subchapter B of  chapter 63 (deficiency procedures) applies to all additions to the  income, estate, gift, and chapter 41, 42, 43, and 44 taxes imposed by  section 6653 (a) and (b) for negligence and fraud.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additions to tax for failure to pay estimated income taxes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Return filed by taxpayer. The addition to the tax for underpayment of  estimated income tax imposed by section 6654 (relating to failure by  individuals to pay estimated income tax) or section 6655 (relating to  failure by corporations to pay estimated income tax) is determined by  reference to the tax shown on the return if a return is filed.  Therefore, such addition may be assessed and collected without regard to  the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 (deficiency procedures) if  a return is filed since such provisions are not applicable to the  assessment of the tax shown on the return. Further, since the additions  to the tax imposed by section 6654 or 6655 are determined solely by  reference to the amount of tax shown on the return if a return is filed,  the assertion of a deficiency with respect to any tax not shown on such  return will not make the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63  (deficiency procedures) apply to the assessment and collection of any  additions to the tax under section 6654 or 6655.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No return filed by taxpayer. If the taxpayer has not filed a  return and his entire income tax liability is asserted as a deficiency  to which the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 63 apply, such  provisions likewise will apply to   any addition to such tax imposed by section 6654 or 6655.
