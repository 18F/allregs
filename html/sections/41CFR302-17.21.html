                                Sec.  302-17.21  What relocation expenses does the WTA cover?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The WTA covers certain allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct  payments to vendors, to the extent that each of them is taxable income.  It does not cover any allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a  vendor   that is nontaxable; that is, your agency will not give you a WTA for  anything that is not considered taxable income to you (see Table 1 in  Sec.  302-17.8 for a summary of tax treatment). In particular, the WTA  covers:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> En route meals and incidental expenses--Reimbursements for meals  and incidental expenses while en route are taxable and, therefore, are  covered by the WTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One Househunting trip--Travel (including per diem and  transportation) expenses for you (and your spouse) for one round trip to  the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters.  Househunting is covered regardless of whether it is reimbursed under the  actual expense or lump sum method. (See Part 302-5 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary quarters--Subsistence expenses for you and your  immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters. Temporary  quarters are covered regardless of whether it is reimbursed under the  actual expense or lump sum method. (See Part 302-6 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extended storage expenses--Extended storage for a temporary  change of station in CONUS or assignment to an isolated duty station in  CONUS, but only if these expenses are allowed by Part 302-8 of this  chapter and your agency's policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Real estate expenses--Expenses for the sale of the residence at  your old official station and purchase of a home at your new official  station. This can also include expenses for settling an unexpired lease  (``breaking'' a lease) at your old official station. (See Part 302-11 of  this chapter. If you do not hold full title to the home you are selling  or buying, see Sec.  302-11.7 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Expenses paid by a relocation company to the extent such  payments constitute taxable income to the employee. The extent to which  such payments constitute taxable income varies according to the  individual circumstances of your relocation, and by the state and  locality in which you reside. (See IRS Publication 521, Moving Expenses,  and appropriate state and local tax authorities for additional  information.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Property Management Services--Payment for the services of a  property manager for renting rather than selling a residence at your old  official station. (See Part 302-15 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Miscellaneous expense allowance--Miscellaneous expenses for  defraying certain relocation expenses not covered by other relocation  benefits. (See Part 302-16 of this chapter.)</p>
