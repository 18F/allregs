                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basis and scope. This section is based on section 1903(d)(5) of the Act, which requires that the Secretary charge a State interest on the Federal share of claims that have been disallowed but have been retained by the State during the administrative appeals process under section 1116(e) of the Act and the Secretary later recovers after the administrative appeals process has been completed. This section does not apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Claims that have been deferred by the Secretary and disallowed within the time limits of Sec.  430.40 of this chapter. Deferral of claims for FFP; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claims for expenditures that have never been paid on a grant award; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disallowances of any claims for services furnished before October 1, 1980, regardless of the date of the claim submitted to CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General principles. (1) CMS will charge the State interest on FFP when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS has notified the Medicaid agency under Sec.  430.42 of this subpart that a State's claim for FFP is not allowable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The agency has requested a reconsideration of the disallowance to the Administrator under Sec.  430.42 of this chapter and has chosen to retain the FFP during the administrative reconsideration process in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> CMS has made a final determination upholding part or all of the disallowance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CMS has made a final determination upholding part or all of the disallowance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The agency has withdrawn its request for administrative reconsideration on all or part of the disallowance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The agency has reversed its decision to retain the funds without withdrawing its request for administrative reconsideration and CMS upholds all or part of the disallowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The agency has appealed the disallowance to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR part 16 and has chosen to retain the FFP during the administrative appeals process in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(A)</em>The Board has made a final determination upholding part or all of the disallowance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>The Board has made a final determination upholding part or all of the disallowance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The agency has withdrawn its appeal on all or part of the disallowance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The agency has reversed its decision to retain the funds without withdrawing its appeal and the Board upholds all or part of the disallowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the courts overturn, in whole or in part, a Board decision that has sustained a disallowance, CMS will return the principal and the interest collected on the funds that were disallowed, upon the completion of all judicial appeals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unless an agency decides to withdraw its request for administrative reconsideration or appeal on part of the disallowance and therefore returns only that part of the funds on which it has withdrawn its request for administrative reconsideration or appeal, any decision to retain or return disallowed funds must apply to the entire amount in dispute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the agency elects to have CMS recover the disputed amount, it may not reverse that election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> State procedures. (1) If the Medicaid agency has requested administrative reconsideration to CMS or appeal

of a disallowance to the Board and wishes to retain the disallowed funds until CMS or the Board issues a final determination, the agency must notify the CMS Regional Office in writing of its decision to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The agency must mail its notice to the CMS Regional Office within 60 days of the date of receipt of the notice of the disallowance, as established by the certified mail receipt accompanying the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the agency withdraws its decision to retain the FFP or its request for administrative reconsideration or appeal on all or part of the FFP, the agency must notify CMS in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amount of interest charged. (1) If the agency retains funds that later become subject to an interest charge under paragraph (b) of this section, CMS will offset from the next Medicaid grant award to the State the amount of the funds subject to the interest charge, plus interest on that amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The interest charge is at the rate CMS determines to be the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day Treasury bill auction rates during the period for which interest will be charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Duration of interest. (1) The interest charge on the amount of disallowed FFP retained by the agency will begin on the date of the disallowance notice and end--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On the date of the final determination by CMS of the administrative reconsideration if the State elects not to appeal to the Board, or final determination by the Board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the date CMS receives written notice from the State that it is withdrawing its request for administrative reconsideration and elects not to appeal to the Board, or withdraws its appeal to the Board on all of the disallowed funds; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the agency withdraws its request for administrative reconsideration on part of the funds on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date CMS receives written notice from the agency that it is withdrawing its request for administrative reconsideration on a specified part of the disallowed funds for the part on which the agency withdraws its request for administrative reconsideration; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date of the final determination by CMS on the part for which the agency pursues its administrative reconsideration; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the agency withdraws its appeal on part of the funds, on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date CMS receives written notice from the agency that it is withdrawing its appeal on a specified part of the disallowed funds for the part on which the agency withdraws its appeal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date of the final determination by the Board on the part for which the agency pursues its appeal; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the agency has given CMS written notice of its intent to repay by installment, in the quarter in which the final installment is paid. Interest during the repayment of Federal funds by installments will be at the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The date CMS receives written notice from the agency that it no longer chooses to retain the funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CMS will not charge interest on FFP retained by an agency for more than 12 months for disallowances of FFP made between October 1, 1980 and August 13, 1981.
