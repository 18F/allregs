                            <p class="depth0">Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and  control system used to comply with the provisions of Sec.  60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from  each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid  waste has been in place for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 5 years or more if active; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each  wellhead except under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator  shall develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive  pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design  changes shall be approved by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a  landfill gas temperature less than 55 [deg]C and with either a nitrogen  level less than 20 percent or an oxygen level less than 5 percent. The  owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature,  nitrogen, or oxygen value at a particular well. A higher operating value  demonstration shall show supporting data that the elevated parameter  does not cause fires or significantly inhibit anaerobic decomposition by  killing methanogens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nitrogen level shall be determined using Method 3C, unless  an alternative test method is established as allowed by Sec.  60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this subpart, the oxygen shall be determined by  an oxygen meter using Method 3A or 3C except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The span shall be set so that the regulatory limit is between 20  and 50 percent of the span;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A data recorder is not required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span, and  ambient air may be used as the span;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A calibration error check is not required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are  10 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration  is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of  the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or  operator shall conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the  collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30  meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated  concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks  or seeps in the cover. The owner or operator may establish an  alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A  surface monitoring design plan shall be developed that includes a  topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any  site-specific deviations from the 30 meter intervals. Areas with steep  slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface  testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a  control system designed and operated in compliance with Sec.  60.752(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is  inoperable, the gas mover system shall be shut down and all valves in  the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to  the atmosphere shall be closed within 1 hour; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operate the control or treatment system at all times when the  collected gas is routed to the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in  paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective  action shall be taken as specified in Sec. 60.755(a)(3) through (5) or  Sec. 60.755(c) of this subpart. If corrective actions are taken as  specified in Sec. 60.755, the monitored exceedance is not a violation  of the operational requirements in this section.
