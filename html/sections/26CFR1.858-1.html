                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> either before or after the close of the  taxable year as long as the declaration is made before the time  prescribed by law for   filing its return for the taxable year (including the period of any  extension of time granted for filing the return).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method of making election. The election must be  made in the return filed by the trust for the taxable year. The election  shall be made by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which the  election applies as a dividend paid during the taxable year of the trust  in computing its real estate investment trust taxable income and, if  applicable, the alternative tax imposed by section 857(b)(3)(A). (In the  case of an election with respect to a taxable year ending before October  5, 1976, if the dividend (or portion thereof) to which the election is  to apply is a capital gain dividend, the trust shall treat the dividend  as paid during such taxable year in computing the amount of capital  gains dividends paid during the taxable year.) In the case of an  election with respect to a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976,  the trust must also specify in its return (or in a statement attached to  its return) the exact dollar amount that is to be treated as having been  paid during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitation based on earnings and profits. The election provided  in section 858(a) may be made only to the extent that the earnings and  profits of the taxable year (computed with the application of sections  857(d) and Sec. 1.857-7) exceed the total amount of distributions out  of such earnings and profits actually made during the taxable year. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, deficiency dividends and  distributions with respect to which an election has been made for a  prior year under section 858(a) are disregarded in determining the total  amount of distributions out of earnings and profits actually made during  the taxable year. The dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which  the real estate investment trust has made a valid election under section  858(a), shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of  the taxable year for which such election is made, and not out of the  earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is  actually made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional limitation based on amount specified. The amount  treated under section 858(a) as having been paid in a taxable year  beginning after October 4, 1976, cannot exceed the lesser of (i) the  dollar amount specified by the trust in its return (or a statement  attached thereto) in making the election or (ii) the amount allowable  under the limitation prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Irrevocability of the election. After the expiration of the time  for filing the return for the taxable year for which an election is made  under section 858(a), such election shall be irrevocable with respect to  the dividend or portion thereof to which it applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receipt by shareholders. Under section 858(b), the dividend or  portion thereof, with respect to which a valid election has been made,  will be includable in the gross income of the shareholders of the real  estate investment trust for the taxable year in which the dividend is  received by them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Illustrations. The application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)  of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The X Trust, a real estate investment trust, had taxable  income (and earnings and profits) for the calendar year 1961 of  $100,000. During that year the trust distributed to shareholders taxable  dividends aggregating $88,000. On March 10, 1962, the trust declared a  dividend of $37,000 payable to shareholders on March 20, 1962. Such  dividend consisted of the first regular quarterly dividend for 1962 of  $25,000 plus an additional $12,000 representing that part of the taxable  income for 1961 which was not distributed in 1961. On March 15, 1962,  the X Trust filed its Federal income tax return and elected therein to  treat $12,000 of the total dividend of $37,000 to be paid to  shareholders on March 20, 1962, as having been paid during the taxable  year 1961. Assuming that the X Trust actually distributed the entire  amount of the dividend of $37,000 on March 20, 1962, an amount equal to  $12,000 thereof will be treated for the purposes of section 857(a) as  having been paid during the taxable year 1961. Upon distribution of such  dividend the trust becomes a qualified real estate investment trust for  the taxable year 1961. Such amount ($12,000) will be considered by the X  Trust as a distribution out of the earnings and profits for the taxable  year 1961, and will be treated by the shareholders as a taxable dividend  for the taxable year in which such distribution is received by them.  However, assuming that the X Trust is not a qualified real estate  investment trust for the calendar year 1962,   nevertheless, the $12,000 portion of the dividend (paid on March 20,  1962) which the trust elected to relate to the calendar year 1961, will  not qualify as a dividend for purposes of section 34, 116, or 243.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The Y Trust, a real estate investment trust, had taxable  income (and earnings and profits) for the calendar year 1964 of  $100,000, and for 1965 taxable income (and earnings and profits) of  $125,000. On January 1, 1964, the trust had a deficit in its earnings  and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, of $115,000. During the  year 1964 the trust distributed to shareholders taxable dividends  aggregating $85,000. On March 5, 1965, the trust declared a dividend of  $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1965. On March 15, 1965,  the Y Trust filed its Federal income tax return in which it included  $40,000 of the total dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on  March 31, 1965, as a dividend paid by it during the taxable year 1964.  On March 31, 1965, the Y Trust distributed the entire amount of the  dividend of $65,000 declared on March 5, 1965. The election under  section 858(a) is valid only to the extent of $15,000, the amount of the  undistributed earnings and profits for 1964 ($100,000 earnings and  profits less $85,000 distributed during 1964). The remainder ($50,000)  of the $65,000 dividend paid on March 31, 1965, could not be the subject  of an election, and such amount will be regarded as a distribution by  the Y Trust out of earnings and profits for the taxable year 1965.  Assuming that the only other distribution by the Y Trust during 1965 was  a distribution of $75,000 paid as a dividend on October 31, 1965, the  total amount of the distribution of $65,000 paid on March 31, 1965, is  to be treated by the shareholders as taxable dividends for the taxable  year in which such dividend is received. The Y Trust will treat the  amount of $15,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits of the  trust for the taxable year 1964, and the remaining $50,000 as a  distribution of the earnings or profits for the year 1965. The  distribution of $75,000 on October 31, 1966, is, of course, a taxable  dividend out of the earnings and profits for the year 1965.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the facts are the same as in example 2, except  that the taxable years involved are calendar years 1977 and 1978, and Y  Trust specified in its Federal income tax return for 1977 that the  dollar amount of $40,000 of the $65,000 distribution payable to  shareholders on March 31, 1978, is to be treated as having been paid in  1977. The result will be the same as in example 2, since the amount of  the undistributed earnings and profits for 1977 is less than the $40,000  amount specified by Y Trust in making its election. Accordingly, the  election is valid only to the extent of $15,000. Y Trust will treat the  amount of $15,000 as a distribution, in 1977, of earnings and profits of  the trust for the taxable year 1977 and the remaining $50,000 as a  distribution, in 1978, of the earnings and profits for 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e))</em>;  sec. 6001 (68A Stat. 731; 26 U.S.C. 6001); sec. 6011 (68A Stat. 732; 26  U.S.C. 6011); sec. 6071 (68A Stat. 749, 26 U.S.C. 6071); sec. 6091 (68A  Stat. 752; 26 U.S.C. 6091); sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805),  Internal Revenue Code of 1954))  [T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4089, Apr. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 7767, 46 FR  11279, Feb. 6, 1981]</p>
