                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The grazing payment rate shall be the loan deficiency payment in  effect for the farm on the date which the producer submits a complete  program application to CCC. For triticale, the grazing rate will be  equal to the loan deficiency payment rate in effect for the predominant  class of wheat in the county where the farm is located as of the date  the application is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The payable units of production shall be computed by multiplying  the eligible grazed acres by the applicable yield determined under  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The payment yield shall be the yield in effect for the  calculation of direct payments under part 1412 of this chapter. In a  case of a farm for which a farm program payment yield is unavailable for  a covered commodity, an appropriate payment yield for the covered  commodity on the farm will be determined by CCC taking into  consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to the  commodity using three (3) similar farms. For triticale, the payment  yield shall be the yield for wheat from three (3) similar farms in that  county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No payment may be received or retained under this subpart to the  extent that the payment, were they considered to be LDP's, would place  that person over the per person per year payment limit that applies to  LDP's. The producer agrees that the CCC may collect any payment  considered to be an overpayment by reason of this subsection by  withholding LDP payments until the matter is resolved, by treating the  LDP as being not payable to the extent that a grazing refund would  otherwise be due, by setoff, or by any other means available to CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payments can be withheld until the actual grazed acreage is  verified and justified in connection with any other reports filed with  FSA with respect to the farm (or filed with some other person or agency)  and until all other necessary information is obtained. CCC may require  such other verification as it deems appropriate to assure that the  program goals are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To receive the payment, the eligible producer must submit a  request for payment on an application form as prescribed by CCC or FSA.  The application may be obtained from the county FSA office, or from the  USDA or FSA web site in the Internet. The form must be submitted to the  county by the close of business on or before March 31 of the calendar  year following the year the crop is normally harvested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The producer will be ineligible for payments under this subpart  if any discrepancies between the reported acreage on the program form  and other reports of acreage by the producer are not resolved by a date  set by CCC.
