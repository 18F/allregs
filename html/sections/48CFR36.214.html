If  negotiations reveal errors in the Government estimate, the estimate  shall be   corrected and the changes shall be documented in the contract file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When appropriate, additional pricing tools may be used. For  example, proposed prices may be compared to current prices for similar  types of work, adjusted for differences in the work site and the  specifications. Also, rough yardsticks may be developed and used, such  as cost per cubic foot for structures, cost per linear foot for  utilities, and cost per cubic yard for excavation or concrete.
