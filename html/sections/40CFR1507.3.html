                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Not later than eight months after publication of these  regulations as finally adopted in the Federal Register, or five months  after the establishment of an agency, whichever shall come later, each  agency shall as necessary adopt procedures to supplement these  regulations. When the agency is a department, major subunits are  encouraged (with the consent of the department) to adopt their own  procedures. Such procedures shall not paraphrase these regulations. They  shall confine themselves to implementing procedures. Each agency shall  consult with the Council while developing its procedures and before  publishing them in the Federal Register for comment. Agencies with  similar programs should consult with each other and the Council to  coordinate their procedures, especially for programs requesting similar  information from applicants. The procedures shall be adopted only after  an opportunity for public review and after review by the Council for  conformity with the Act and these regulations. The Council shall  complete its review within 30 days. Once in effect they shall be filed  with the Council and made readily available to the public. Agencies are  encouraged to publish explanatory guidance for these regulations and  their own procedures. Agencies shall continue to review their policies  and procedures and in consultation with the Council to revise them as  necessary to ensure full compliance with the purposes and provisions of  the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency procedures shall comply with these regulations except  where compliance would be inconsistent with statutory requirements and  shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those procedures required by Sec. Sec.  1501.2(d), 1502.9(c)(3),  1505.1, 1506.6(e), and 1508.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific criteria for and identification of those typical  classes of action:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Which normally do require environmental impact statements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Which normally do not require either an environmental impact  statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusions (Sec.   1508.4)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Which normally require environmental assessments but not  necessarily environmental impact statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency procedures may include specific criteria for providing  limited exceptions to the provisions of these regulations for classified  proposals. They are proposed actions which are specifically authorized  under criteria established by an Executive Order or statute to be kept  secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in  fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order or statute.  Environmental assessments and environmental impact statements   which address classified proposals may be safeguarded and restricted  from public dissemination in accordance with agencies' own regulations  applicable to classified information. These documents may be organized  so that classified portions can be included as annexes, in order that  the unclassified portions can be made available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency procedures may provide for periods of time other than  those presented in Sec.  1506.10 when necessary to comply with other  specific statutory requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agency procedures may provide that where there is a lengthy  period between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental impact  statement and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent  required by Sec.  1501.7 may be published at a reasonable time in  advance of preparation of the draft statement.</p>
