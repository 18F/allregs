                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Forms of bonus. The bonus may be paid to the exporter in CCC Certificates or in any other form specified in the applicable Invitation which CCC determines to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quantity on which bonus is paid. The quantity of the eligible commodity exported from the U.S. which is eligible for the payment of a CCC bonus is the net weight (less any dockage, if applicable) or count which is established by the Official Inspection Certificate, the Official Weight Certificate or the export bill of lading, whichever is less. If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid prior to the entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, this quantity will be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of making payment to the exporter. If the exporter is not paid the bonus until the commodity enters into the eligible country, then this quantity will also be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of making payment to the exporter, unless in the

determination of CCC, there is evidence to suggest that there was destruction, diversion or loss of the eligible commodity prior to entry into the eligible country. The payment of a bonus value to an exporter does not indicate that the bonus has been earned by the exporter under the Agreement; pursuant to Sec. 1494.801(a)(3), the bonus is not earned by the exporter until the eligible commodity enters into the eligible country in accordance with the Agreement and the exporter submits proof of such entry to CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for bonus payment under ``Option A.'' If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option A'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after export of the eligible commodity, the exporter must, within 30 calendar days after the date of export of the eligible commodity, furnish to the Director, at the address referenced in the Notice to Exporters--Contacts for EEP, a written request for payment of the bonus. All documents submitted to support such a request must be acceptable to the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To support each bonus payment request, the exporter must furnish to the Director the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The original or an original copy of the on-board bill of lading issued for the export carrier and signed by an agent of the export carrier. The bill of lading must show:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The identification of the export carrier;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date and place of issuance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The quantity of the eligible commodity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An on-board date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible country.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The original or an original copy of the Official Weight Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate must show:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time of issuance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date and place of issuance; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The weight or count of the eligible commodity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The original or an original copy of the Official Inspection Certificate, as required in the applicable Invitation. The certificate must show:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The identification of the export carrier, if known at the time of issuance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date and place of issuance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The quantity of the eligible commodity to which the certificate relates; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The quality description of the eligible commodity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the documents submitted under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section do not specify the export carrier, the exporter must also submit a signed certification that the commodity represented by the Official Inspection and/or the Official Weight certificates is the identical eligible commodity represented on the export bill of lading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the export of the eligible commodity was by lash barge, the exporter must furnish, in addition to the documents required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement from the vessel's agent showing that the lash barge was loaded to the lash vessel named in the on-board lash bill of lading and that the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the export of the eligible commodity was from a Canadian transshipment port on the St. Lawrence River, the exporter must furnish to the Director the following, in addition to the documents required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentary evidence covering the movement of the eligible commodity from the United States to the export carrier described in the on-board bill of lading issued at the Canadian transshipment port and showing the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and, if applicable, (c)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A certification that the eligible commodity exported is the identical eligible commodity that was shipped from the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the export of the eligible commodity was by railcar or truck, the exporter must furnish to the Director the following, in addition to the documents required by paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The authenticated landing certificate or similar document issued by the

government of the eligible country; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The original or an original copy of the bill of lading issued at the point of loading the railcar or truck. The bill of lading must show:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The identification of the export carrier;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date and place of issuance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The quantity of the eligible commodity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The date that the railcar or truck was loaded; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> That the eligible commodity is destined for the eligible country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for bonus payment under ``Option B.'' If the exporter has furnished performance security under ``Option B'' of the applicable Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid after the entry of the exported eligible commodity into the eligible country, the exporter must, within 60 calendar days after the date of entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, furnish to the Director at the address referenced in the Notice to Exporters--Contracts for EEP, a written request for payment of the bonus. To support each request, the exporter must furnish to the Director, in a form acceptable to the Director, the documents specified in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable, along with the certification of entry specified in Sec. 1494.401(f)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time frame for payment of a bonus. CCC will endeavor to pay the bonus to the exporter within 10 business days after CCC determines that the documents supporting the bonus request are acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certificate amount. If CCC decides to pay the bonus in the form of a CCC Certificate(s), the dollar value of the certificate(s) issued to the exporter will be determined by multiplying the CCC bonus specified in the Agreement by the net quantity of the eligible commodity on which the bonus is to be paid, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, less any dockage if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Late requests for bonus payment. If CCC decides to pay the bonus in the form of a CCC Certificate(s) and the exporter fails to request issuance of the certificate(s) within 30 calendar days after the date of export of the eligible commodity, if the exporter has chosen performance security ``Option A,'' or within 60 days after the entry of the eligible commodity into the eligible country, if the exporter has chosen performance security ``Option B'', CCC may, upon issuing the certificate(s), discount the certificate(s) in an amount determined appropriate by CCC to compensate it for costs which may be incurred by CCC as a result of the exporter's delay.</p>
