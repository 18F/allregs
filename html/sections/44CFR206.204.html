This section describes the policies and procedures applicable during the performance of eligible work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Advances of funds. Advances of funds will be made in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time limitations for completion of work--(1) Deadlines. The project completion deadlines shown below are set from the date that a major disaster or emergency is declared and apply to all projects approved under State disaster assistance grants.</p><p class="depth0">Completion Deadlines------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Type of work                            Months------------------------------------------------------------------------Debris clearance..............................................         6Emergency work................................................         6Permanent work................................................        18------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions.

Requests for time extensions beyond the Grantee's authority shall be submitted by the Grantee to the Regional Administrator and shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The dates and provisions of all previous time extensions on the project; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A detailed justification for the delay and a projected completion date. The Regional Administrator shall review the request and make a determination. The Grantee shall be notified of the Regional Administrator's determination in writing. If the Regional Administrator approves the request, the letter shall reflect the approved completion date and any other requirements the Regional Administrator may determine necessary to ensure that the new completion date is met. If the Regional Administrator denies the time extension request, the grantee may, upon completion of the project, be reimbursed for eligible project costs incurred only up to the latest approved completion date. If the project is not

completed, no Federal funding will be provided for that project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Cost Overruns. (1) During the execution of approved work a subgrantee may find that the actual project costs exceed the approved Project Worksheet estimates. Such cost overruns normally fall into the following three categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> During the execution of approved work a subgrantee may find that the actual project costs exceed the approved Project Worksheet estimates. Such cost overruns normally fall into the following three categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Variations in unit prices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in the scope of eligible work; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Delays in timely starts or completion of eligible work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The subgrantee must evaluate each cost overrun and, when justified, submit a request for additional funding through the Grantee to the Regional Administrator for a final determination. All requests for the Regional Administrator's approval will contain sufficient documentation to support the eligibility of all claimed work and costs. The Grantee must include a written recommendation when forwarding the request. The Regional Administrator will notify the Grantee in writing of the final determination. FEMA will not normally review an overrun for an individual small project. The normal procedure for small projects will be that when a subgrantee discovers a significant overrun related to the total final cost for all small projects, the subgrantee may submit an appeal for additional funding in accordance with Sec. 206.206, within 60 days following the completion of all its small projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Progress reports. Progress reports will be submitted by the Grantee to the Regional Administrator quarterly. The Regional Administrator and Grantee shall negotiate the date for submission of the first report. Such reports will describe the status of those projects on which a final payment of the Federal share has not been made to the grantee and outline any problems or circumstances expected to result in noncompliance with the approved grant conditions.
