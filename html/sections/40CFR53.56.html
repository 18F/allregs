                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This test procedure is designed to test various  sampler performance parameters under variations in ambient (barometric)  pressure. Tests shall be conducted in a pressure-controlled environment  over two 6-hour time periods during which reference pressure and flow  rate measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.  Specific parameters to be evaluated at operating pressures of 600 and  800 mm Hg are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sample flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flow rate regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Flow rate measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coefficient of variability measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ambient pressure measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Proper operation of the sampler when exposed to ambient  pressure extremes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the  corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable  test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each  performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test  procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification  given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the  associated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 method (as  applicable) to pass this test procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Technical definition. Sample flow rate means the quantitative  volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter  the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual  volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the  inlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required test equipment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hypobaric chamber or other  pressure-controlled environment or environments, capable of obtaining  and maintaining pressures at 600 mm Hg and 800 mm Hg required for the  test with an accuracy of 5 mm Hg. Henceforth, where the test procedures  specify a test or environmental chamber, an alternative pressure- controlled environmental area or areas may be substituted, provided the  test pressure requirements are met. Means for simulating ambient  pressure using a closed-loop sample air system may also be approved for  this test; such a proposed method for simulating the test pressure  conditions may be described and submitted to EPA at the address given in  Sec. 53.4(a) prior to conducting the test for a specific individual  determination of acceptability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual  volumetric sampler flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum  range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy.  Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or  digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended.  While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow  rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow  measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow  rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient  temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ambient air temperature recorder (if needed for volumetric  corrections to flow rate measurements) with a range -30 C to =50 C,  certified accurate to within 0.5 C. If the certified flow meter does  not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient temperature  measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability  or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2  mm Hg. Ambient air pressure measurements must be made using continuous  (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to  exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L- 30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate  at the sampler downtube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in  the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or  flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or  other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the  filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part  50, appendix L (if required).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit  documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration,  certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if  required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy  of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest  pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at  zero and at least one flow rate within [3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7  days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are  to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the  entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test setup. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Setup of the sampler shall be performed as  required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the  sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in  Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in  the pressure-controlled chamber in its normal configuration for  collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating  an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration  of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and  flow measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's  operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow  measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as  described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be  conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried  out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to  the outlet of the flow rate meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The barometer shall be installed in the test chamber such that  it will accurately measure the air pressure to which the candidate  sampler is subjected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e)  of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample  collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or  instruction manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test shall consist of two test runs, one at each of the  following conditions of chamber pressure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 600 mm Hg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 800 mm Hg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each of the two test runs, set the selected chamber pressure  for the test run. Upon achieving each pressure setpoint in the chamber,  the candidate sampler shall be pressure-equilibrated for a period of at  least 30 minutes prior to the test run. Following the conditioning time,  set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period  at a convenient time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> During each 6-hour test period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter  at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and  pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate,  ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency  as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the  actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine and record the ambient (chamber) pressure indicated  by the sampler and the corresponding ambient (chamber) pressure measured  by the barometer specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section at  intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> At the end of each test period, terminate the sample period (if  not automatically terminated by the sampler) and download all archived  instrument data for the test run from the test sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Test results. For each of the two test runs, examine the chamber  pressure measurements. Verify that the pressure met the requirements  specified in paragraph (f) of this section at all times during the test.  If not, the test run is not valid and must be repeated. Determine the  test results as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements  (Qref) of the test sampler flow rate, tabulate each flow rate  measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure  corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each  measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding  temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow  rate for the sample period (Qref,ave) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 17 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.079  where:  n equals the number of discrete certified flow measurements over the 6-</p><p class="depth0">hour test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the percent difference between this mean flow rate  value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 18 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.080</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 18 of this paragraph (g)(1) must be within [5  percent for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sample flow rate regulation. (i) From the certified measurements  of the test sampler flow rate, calculate the sample coefficient of  variation of the discrete measurements as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 19 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.081</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the calculated coefficient of  variation for the certified flow rates must not exceed 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flow rate measurement accuracy. (i) Using the mean volumetric  flow rate reported by the candidate test sampler at the completion of  each 6-hour test (Qind,ave), determine the accuracy of the  reported mean flow rate as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 20 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.082</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 20 of this paragraph (g)(3) shall not exceed 2  percent for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow rate CV measurement accuracy. (i) Using the flow rate  coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate test sampler at the  completion of the 6-hour test (%CVind), determine the  accuracy of the reported coefficient of variation as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 21 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.083</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the absolute difference in  values calculated in Equation 21 of this paragraph (g)(4) must not  exceed 0.3 (CV%) for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ambient pressure measurement accuracy. (i) Calculate the  absolute difference between the mean ambient air pressure indicated by  the test sampler and the ambient (chamber) air pressure measured with  the reference barometer as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 22 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.084  where:  Pind,ave = mean ambient pressure indicated by the test</p><p class="depth0">sampler, mm Hg; and   Pref,ave = mean barometric pressure measured by the reference</p><p class="depth0">barometer, mm Hg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The calculated pressure difference must be less than 10 mm Hg  for each test run to pass the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sampler functionality. To pass the sampler functionality test,  the following two conditions must both be met for each test run:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sampler must not shut down during any part of the 6-hour  tests; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An inspection of the downloaded data from the test sampler  verifies that all the data are consistent with normal operation of the  sampler.
