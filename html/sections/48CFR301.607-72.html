                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FAC-P/PM certification prerequisites and continuous learning requirements apply to all HHS employees who seek to obtain a FAC-P/PM certification. Although obtaining a FAC-P/PM certification qualifies employees to serve as a Program or Project Manager, it does not ensure their selection or designation as such. (Note: Contractors and their employees are not eligible to be certified or to serve as Program or Project Managers.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory certification is limited to major and non-major IT and construction capital investment acquisitions. Consistent with OFPP guidance, HHS requires FAC-P/PM Level III certification for Program and Project Managers responsible for major IT and construction capital investments--i.e., those requiring preparation of an OMB Exhibit 300, HHS Form 300, or equivalent. An individual must obtain FAC-P/PM Level III certification within 1 year from the date of being assigned to such a major capital investment. Also, HHS requires that an individual obtain FAC-P/PM Level II or I certification for non-major IT and construction--i.e., tactical or supporting, capital investments, respectively, within 2 years from the date of being assigned to such a non-major capital investment. See Appendix A, Federal Acquisition Certification--Program and Project Managers--HHS Projects and Programs with Associated Certification Levels, in the P/PM Handbook for additional information regarding major and non-major IT and construction capital investments. FAC-P/PM certification for other types of investments [e.g., advanced research and development (R & D)] is encouraged, but is not mandatory.</p>
