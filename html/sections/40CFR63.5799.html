                            <p class="depth0">To calculate your facility's organic HAP emissions in tpy for purposes of determining which paragraphs in Sec. 63.5805 apply to you, you must use the procedures in either paragraph (a) of this section for new facilities prior to startup, or paragraph (b) of this section for existing facilities and new facilities after startup. You are not required to calculate or report emissions under this section if you are an existing facility that does not have centrifugal casting or continuous lamination/casting operations, or a new facility that does not have any of the following operations: Open molding, centrifugal casting, continuous lamination/casting, pultrusion, SMC and BMC manufacturing, and mixing. Emissions calculation and emission reporting procedures in other sections of this subpart still apply. Calculate organic HAP emissions prior to any add-on control device, and do not include organic HAP emissions from any resin or gel coat used in operations subject to the Boat Manufacturing NESHAP, 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, or from the manufacture of large parts as defined in Sec. 63.5805(d)(2). For centrifugal casting operations at existing facilities, do not include any organic HAP emissions where resin or gel coat is applied to an open centrifugal mold using open molding application techniques. Table 1 and the Table 1 footnotes to this subpart present more information on calculating centrifugal casting organic HAP emissions. The timing and reporting of these calculations is discussed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For new facilities prior to startup, calculate a weighted average organic HAP emissions factor for the operations specified in Sec. 63.5805(c) and (d) on a lbs/ton of resin and gel coat basis. Base the weighted average on your projected operation for the 12 months subsequent to facility startup. Multiply the weighted average organic HAP emissions factor by projected resin use over the same period. You may calculate your organic HAP emissions factor based on the factors in Table 1 to this subpart, or you may use any HAP emissions factor approved by us, such as factors from the ``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources (AP-42),'' or organic HAP emissions test data from similar facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For existing facilities and new facilities after startup, you may use the procedures in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. If the emission factors for an existing facility have changed over the period of time prior to their initial compliance date due to incorporation of pollution-prevention control techniques, existing facilities may base the average emission factor on their operations as they exist on the compliance date. If an existing facility has accepted an enforceable permit limit that would result in less than 100 tpy of HAP measured prior to any add-on controls, and can demonstrate that they will operate at that level subsequent to the compliance date, they can be deemed to be below the 100 tpy threshold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use a calculated emission factor. Calculate a weighted average organic HAP emissions factor on a lbs/ton of resin and gel coat basis. Base the weighted average on the prior 12 months of operation. Multiply the weighted average organic HAP emissions factor by resin and gel coat use over the same period. You may calculate this organic HAP emissions factor based on the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, or you may use any organic HAP emissions factor approved by us, such as factors from AP-42, or site-specific organic HAP emissions

factors if they are supported by HAP emissions test data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct performance testing. Conduct performance testing using the test procedures in Sec. 63.5850 to determine a site-specific organic HAP emissions factor in units of lbs/ton of resin and gel coat used. Conduct the test under conditions expected to result in the highest possible organic HAP emissions. Multiply this factor by annual resin and gel coat use to determine annual organic HAP emissions. This calculation must be repeated and reported annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Existing facilities must initially perform this calculation based on their 12 months of operation prior to April 21, 2003, and include this information with their initial notification report. Existing facilities must repeat the calculation based on their resin and gel coat use in the 12 months prior to their initial compliance date, and submit this information with their initial compliance report. After their initial compliance date, existing and new facilities must recalculate organic HAP emissions over the 12-month period ending June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date following their compliance date specified in Sec. 63.5800. Subsequent calculations should cover the periods in the semiannual compliance reports.
