Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing using Equation W-10A or Equation W-10B of this section. Equation W-10A applies to well venting when the flowback rate is measured from a specified number of example completions or workovers and Equation W-10B applies when the flowback vent or flare volume is measured for each completion or workover. Completion and workover activities are separated into two periods, an initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks and a subsequent period when gas content is sufficient to route the flowback to a separator or when the gas content is sufficient to allow measurement by the devices specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of whether a separator is actually utilized. If you elect to use Equation W-10A of this section, you must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
