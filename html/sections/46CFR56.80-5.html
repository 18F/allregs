                            <p class="depth0">Pipe may be bent by any hot or cold method and to any radius which will result in a bend surface free of cracks, as determined by a method of inspection specified in the design, and substantially free of buckles. Such bends shall meet the design requirements of 102.4.5 and 104.2.1 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). This shall not prohibit the use of bends designed as creased or corrugated. If doubt exists as to the wall thickness being adequate, Class I piping having diameters exceeding 4 inches shall be nondestructively examined by the use of ultrasonics or other acceptable method. Alternatively, the pipe may be drilled, gaged, and fitted with a screwed plug extending outside the pipe covering. The nondestructive method shall be employed where the design temperature exceeds 750 [deg]F. Prior to the use of nondestructive method of examination by the above procedure, it shall be demonstrated by the user, in the presence of a marine inspector on specimens similar to those to be examined, that consistent results, having an accuracy of plus or minus 3 percent, can be obtained.
