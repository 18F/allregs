                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Powers of an Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge may take any action and may prescribe all necessary rules and regulations to govern the conduct of the proceedings to ensure a fair and impartial hearing, and to avoid delay in the disposition of the proceedings. In accordance with the rules in this subchapter, an Administrative Law Judge may do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give notice of and hold prehearing conferences and hearings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administer oaths and affirmations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issue subpoenas authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rule on offers of proof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Receive relevant and material evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Regulate the course of the administrative adjudication in accordance with the rules of this subchapter and the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Hold conferences to settle or simplify the issues by consent of the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Dispose of procedural motions and requests, except motions that under this part are made directly to the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Issue orders permitting inspection and examination of lands, buildings, equipment, and any other physical thing and the copying of any document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issue decisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> To take any other action authorized by these rules and permitted by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on the power of the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge is bound by the procedural requirements of this part and the precedent opinions of the Agency. This section does not preclude an Administrative Law Judge from barring a person from a specific proceeding based on a finding of obstreperous or disruptive behavior in that proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disqualification. The Administrative Law Judge may disqualify himself or herself at any time, either at the request of any party or upon his or her own initiative. Assignments of Administrative Law Judges are made by the Chief Administrative Law Judge upon the request of the Assistant Administrator. Any request for a change in such assignment, including disqualification, will be considered only for good cause which would unduly prejudice the proceeding.
