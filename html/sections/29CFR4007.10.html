The designated recordkeeper under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must retain, for a period of six years after the premium due date, all plan records that are necessary to establish, support, and validate the amount of any premium required to be paid and any information required to be reported (``premium-related information'') under this part and part 4006 of this chapter and under PBGC's premium filing instructions. Records that must be retained pursuant to this paragraph include, but are not limited to, records that establish the number of plan participants and that support and demonstrate the calculation of unfunded vested benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The designated recordkeeper under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must retain, for a period of six years after the premium due date, all plan records that are necessary to establish, support, and validate the amount of any premium required to be paid and any information required to be reported (``premium-related information'') under this part and part 4006 of this chapter and under PBGC's premium filing instructions. Records that must be retained pursuant to this paragraph include, but are not limited to, records that establish the number of plan participants and that support and demonstrate the calculation of unfunded vested benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic recordkeeping. A designated recordkeeper may use electronic media for maintenance and retention of records required by this part in accordance with the requirements of subpart E of part 4000 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Designated recordkeepers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the flat-rate and variable-rate premiums described in Sec. 4006.3 of this chapter, the plan administrator is the designated recordkeeper.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the premium for certain terminated single-employer plans described in Sec. 4006.7 of this chapter, each person who was a contributing sponsor of such a plan, or was a member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, as of the day before the plan's termination date is a designated recordkeeper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records. (i) Records that must be retained pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of

this section include, but are not limited to, records prepared by the plan administrator, a plan sponsor, an employer required to contribute to the plan with respect to its employees, an enrolled actuary performing services for the plan, or an insurance carrier issuing any contract to pay benefits under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records that must be retained pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of

this section include, but are not limited to, records prepared by the plan administrator, a plan sponsor, an employer required to contribute to the plan with respect to its employees, an enrolled actuary performing services for the plan, or an insurance carrier issuing any contract to pay benefits under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, ``records'' include, but are not limited to, plan documents; participant data records; personnel and payroll records; actuarial tables, worksheets, and reports; records of computations, projections, and estimates; benefit statements, disclosures, and applications; financial and tax records; insurance contracts; records of plan procedures and practices; and any other records, whether in written, electronic, or other format, that are relevant to the determination of the amount of any premium required to be paid or any premium-related information required to be reported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a record to be produced for PBGC inspection and copying exists in more than one format, it must be produced in the format specified by PBGC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PBGC audit--(1) In general. In order to determine the correctness of any premium paid or premium-related information reported or to determine the amount of any premium required to be paid or any premium-related information required to be reported, PBGC may--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In order to determine the correctness of any premium paid or premium-related information reported or to determine the amount of any premium required to be paid or any premium-related information required to be reported, PBGC may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Audit any premium filing,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspect and copy any records that are relevant to the determination of the amount of any premium required to be paid and any premium-related information required to be reported, including (without limitation) the records described in paragraph (a) of this section, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Require disclosure of any manual or automated system or process used to determine any premium paid or premium-related information reported, and demonstration of its operation in order to permit PBGC to determine the effectiveness of the system or process and the reliability of information produced by the system or process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deficiencies found on audit. If, upon audit, PBGC determines that a premium due under this part was underpaid, late payment interest and penalty charges will apply as provided for in this part. If, upon audit, PBGC determines that required information was not timely and accurately reported, a penalty may be assessed under ERISA section 4071.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insufficient records. In determining the premium due, if, in the judgment of PBGC, a plan's records fail to establish the participant count or (for a single-employer plan) the plan's unfunded vested benefits for any premium payment year, PBGC may rely on data it obtains from other sources (including the IRS and the Department of Labor) for presumptively establishing the participant count and/or unfunded vested benefits for premium computation purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Providing record information--(1) In general. A designated recordkeeper must make the records retained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section available to PBGC promptly upon request for inspection and photocopying (or, for electronic records, inspection, electronic copying, and printout) at the location where they are kept (or another, mutually agreeable, location). If PBGC requests in writing that records retained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or information in such records, be submitted to PBGC, the designated recordkeeper must submit the requested materials to PBGC either electronically or by hand, mail, or commercial delivery service within 45 days of the date of PBGC's request therefor, or by a different time specified in the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a designated recordkeeper may automatically extend the period described in paragraph (c)(1) by submitting a certification to the PBGC prior to the expiration of that time period. The certification shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify a date to which the time period described in paragraph (c)(1) is extended that is no more than 90 days from the date of the PBGC's written request for information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain a statement, certified to by the designated recordkeeper under penalty of perjury (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001),

that, despite reasonable efforts, the additional time is necessary to comply with the PBGC's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shortening of time period. The PBGC may in its discretion shorten the time period described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section where it determines that the interests of PBGC may be prejudiced by a delay in the receipt of the information (e.g., where collection of unpaid premiums (or any associated interest or penalties) would otherwise be jeopardized). If the PBGC shortens the time period described in paragraph (c)(1), no extension is available under paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Address and timeliness. Information required to be submitted under paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted to the address specified in the PBGC's request. The timeliness of a submission shall be determined in accordance with Secs. 4007.5 and 4007.6.
