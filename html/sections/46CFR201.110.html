                                Sec. 201.110  Depositions: request for orders to take; time of filing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Administration or presiding officer may, upon proper request of  a party to a proceeding or under circumstances deemed proper, issue an  order to take a deposition regarding any matter, not privileged, which  is relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceedings. A motion  to take a deposition shall be filed not less than fifteen (15) days  before the proposed date for taking the deposition, unless a shorter  period is fixed under Sec. 201.54, and shall set forth the reason for  the deposition, the place and time of taking, the officer before whom it  is to be taken, the name and address of each witness to be examined, if  known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient  to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs,  and whether the deposition is to be based upon written interrogatories  or upon oral examination. If the deposition is to be based upon oral  examination, the motion shall contain a statement of the matters  concerning which each witness will testify. If the deposition is to be  based on written interrogatories, the motion shall be accompanied by the  interrogatories to be propounded, serially numbered. Copies of all  motions to take depositions, and accompanying interrogatories, if any,  shall conform to the requirements of subpart D of this part. Objection  to the taking of such depositions may be made in an answer to such  motion. Without prejudice to objection, the answer may also state  objection to any individual interrogatory, and if the deposition is  permitted, the presiding officer will rule upon such objections to  interrogatories. A party served with an order to take a deposition on  written interrogatories shall have ten (10) days after date of service  of such order unless a shorter period is fixed under Sec. 201.54,  within which to file and serve written cross interrogatories, which  shall be served pursuant to subpart D of this part. Answers to  applications for cross interrogatories may be filed in accordance with  Sec. 201.80. Upon the issuance of an order by the Administration or the  presiding officer for the taking of a deposition, the Docket Clerk shall  mail a copy thereof to all parties, including the party who requested  the deposition. An application to take a deposition in a foreign country  will be entertained when necessary or convenient, and authority to take  such deposition will be granted upon such notice and other terms and  directions as are lawful and appropriate.</p>
