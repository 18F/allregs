                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test  and a ``hot'' start test following the ``cold'' start by 10 minutes.  Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the  driving schedule, and engine shutdown make a complete cold start test.  Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving  schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted  with ambient air and a continuously proportional sample is collected for  analysis during each phase. The composite samples collected in bags are  analyzed for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and,  optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. A parallel sample of the dilution  air is similarly analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon  dioxide, and, optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. Methanol and  formaldehyde samples (exhaust and dilution air) are collected and  analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (a single dilution air  formaldehyde sample covering the total time of the test may be collected  in place of individual test phases).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The vehicle speed, as measured from the dynamometer roll, shall  be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test  validity, shall be supplied on request of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be  performed at test points, provided an emission sample is not taken, for  the purpose of finding the minimum throttle action to maintain the  proper speed-time relationship, or to permit sampling system  adjustments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The drive wheel tires must be inflated to the manufacturer's  recommended pressure, [15 kPa ([2.2 psi). The drive wheel tire pressure  shall be reported with the test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the dynamometer has not been operated during the two-hour  period immediately preceding the test, it shall be warmed up for 15  minutes by operating at 50 km/h (31 mph) using a   nontest vehicle, or as recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it  shall be set within one hour prior to the exhaust emissions test phase.  The test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers  using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set  anytime prior to the beginning of the emissions test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of  dynamometer roll revolutions, shall be determined for the transient cold  start, stabilized cold start, and transient hot start phases of the  test.
