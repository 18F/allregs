                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility criteria. A U.S. national incarcerated abroad is  considered eligible to receive funded medical treatment under the  following general criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequate treatment cannot or will not be provided by prison  authorities or the host government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All reasonable attempts to obtain private resources (prisoner's  family, friends, etc.) have failed, or such resources do not exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There are medical indications that the emergency medical  assistance is necessary to prevent, or attempt to prevent, the death of  the prisoners, or failure to provide the serviced will cause permanent  disablement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services covered. Funds, once approved, may be expended for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medical examination, when required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emergency treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-elective surgery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Medications and related medical supplies and equipment required  on a routine basis to sustain life;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Preventive or protective medications and medical supplies and  equipment (vaccinations, inoculations, etc.) required to combat epidemic  conditions (general or intramural);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Childbirth attendance, including necessary medical care of  newborn children; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Within the consular district, transportation for the U.S.  national and attendant(s) designated by incarcerating officials between  the place of incarceration and the place(s) of treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consular responsibility. As soon as the consular officer is  aware that a U.S. national prisoner in the consular district faces a  medical crisis, the officer should take the following actions, setting  forth the order or priority based on an evaluation of the facts  received:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make every effort to contact the ill or injured prisoner as soon  as possible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take steps to obtain a professional medical diagnosis and  prognosis of the ill or injured prisoner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine as accurately as possible the estimated costs of  recommended treatment or surgery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain the names and addreses of family or friends who might  serve as a source of private funds for medical services, and attempt to  obtain the necessary funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Request the prisoner to execute a promissory note, since funds  expended by the Department to cover medical services normally are on a  reimbursable basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Submit the above information, along with recommendations and  evaluations, to the Department for approval and authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency expenditure authorization. When a medical emergency  prohibits the delay inherent in contacting the Department and receiving  authority to expend funds, the consular officer can expend up to an  amount to be established by the Department without prior Departmental  approval if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Symptoms determine eligibility for emergency medical treatment;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An immediate medical examination is warranted in order to verify  the alleged abuse of a U.S. national prisoner by arresting or confining  authorities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediate emergency medical treatment or surgery is necessary to  prevent death or permanent disablement, and there is insufficient time  to explore private funds or obtain Department approval; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A promissory note already has been executed by the prisoner, or  if the circumstances warrant, by the consular officer without recourse.</p>
