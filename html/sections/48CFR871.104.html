This  restriction also applies to any contracting firm in which the management  broker has an interest and in which it could be presumed that the firm  would have an advantage over the other bidders. This does not preclude  the management broker from performing routine recurring maintenance or  minor repairs. When seeking payment for maintenance or repairs, the  management broker must establish that any charges are not in excess of  the prevailing fees for similar services in the area.</p>
