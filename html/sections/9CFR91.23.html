However, for a distance not to exceed 8 feet at the end of alleyways in the bow and the stern of ship, and where obstructions of less than 3 feet in length occur, the width may be reduced to a minimum of 24 inches. A sufficient number of athwartship alleyways at least 24 inches in width shall be provided to afford ready access to scuppers and to ends of alleyways running fore and aft. However, on exposed decks where scuppers and the end of fore and aft alleyways are readily accessible athwartship alleyways are not required and if the alleyways are to be used for feeding or watering livestock, but not for loading or unloading of livestock, such alleyways shall have a minimum width of 28 inches.
