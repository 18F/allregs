                                Sec.  17.18  Prepublication review.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All individuals with authorized access to Sensitive  Compartmented Information shall be required to sign nondisclosure  agreements containing a provision for prepublication review to assure  deletion of Sensitive Compartmented Information and other classified  information. Sensitive Compartmented Information is information that not  only is classified for national security reasons as Top Secret, Secret,  or Confidential, but also is subject to special access and handling  requirements because it involves or derives from particularly sensitive  intelligence sources and methods. The prepublication review provision  will require Department of Justice employees and other individuals who  are authorized to have access to Sensitive Compartmented Information to  submit certain material, described further in the agreement, to the  Department prior to its publication to provide an opportunity for  determining whether an unauthorized disclosure of Sensitive  Compartmented Information or other classified information would occur as  a consequence of it publication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons subject to these requirements are invited to discuss  their plans for public disclosures of information that may be subject to  these obligations with authorized Department representatives at an early  stage, or as soon as circumstances indicate these policies must be  considered. Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section for FBI  personnel, all questions concerning these obligations should be  addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for National Security,  Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC  20530. The official views of the Department on whether specific  materials require prepublication review may be expressed only by the  Assistant Attorney General for National Security and persons should not  act in reliance upon the views of other Department personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prepublication review is required only as expressly provided for  in a nondisclosure agreement. However, all persons who have had access  to classified information have an obligation to avoid unauthorized  disclosures of such information. Therefore, persons who have such access  but are not otherwise required to submit to prepublication review under  the terms of an employment or other nondisclosure agreement are  encouraged to submit material for prepublication review voluntarily if  they believe that such material may contain classified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The nature and extent of the material that is required to be  submitted for prepublication review under nondisclosure agreements is  expressly provided for in those agreements. It should be clear, however,  that such requirements do not extend to any materials that exclusively  contain information lawfully obtained at a time when the author has no  employment, contract, or other relationship with the United States  Government or that contain information exclusively acquired outside the  scope of employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person's obligation to submit material for prepublication  review remains identical whether such person prepares the materials or  causes or assists another person (such as a ghost writer, spouse,  friend, or editor) in preparing the material. Material covered by a  nondisclosure agreement requiring prepublication review must be  submitted prior to discussing it with or showing it to a publisher, co- author, or any other person who is not authorized to have access to it.  In this regard, it should be noted that a failure to submit such  material for prepublication review constitutes a breach of the  obligation and exposes the author to remedial action even in cases where  the published material does not actually contain Sensitive Compartmented  Information or classified information. See Snepp v. United States, 444  U.S. 507 (1980).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The requirement to submit material for prepublication review is  not limited to any particular type of material or disclosure or methods  of production. Written materials include not only book manuscripts but  all other forms of written materials intended for public disclosure,  such as (but not limited to) newspaper columns, magazine   articles, letters to the editor, book reviews, pamphlets, scholarly  papers, and fictional material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Oral statements are also within the scope of a prepublication  review requirement when based upon written materials, such as an outline  of the statements to be made. There is no requirement to prepare written  materials for review, however, unless there is reason to believe in  advance that oral statements may contain Sensitive Compartmented  Information or other information required to be submitted for review  under the terms of the nondisclosure agreement. Thus, a person may  participate in an oral presentation where there is no opportunity for  prior preparation (e.g., news interview, panel discussion) without  violating the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Material submitted for republication review will be reviewed  solely for the purpose of identifying and preventing the disclosure of  Sensitive Compartmented Information and other classified information.  This review will be conducted in an impartial manner without regard to  whether the material is critical of or favorable to the Department. No  effort will be made to delete embarrassing or critical statements that  are unclassified. Materials submitted for review will be disseminated to  other persons or agencies only to the extent necessary to identify  classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The Assistant Attorney General for National Security or a  designee (or, in the case of FBI employees, the Section Chief, Records/ Information Dissemination Section, Records Management Division) will  respond substantively to prepublication review requests within 30  working days of receipt of the submission. Priority shall be given to  reviewing speeches, newspaper articles, and other materials that the  author seeks to publish on an expedited basis. The Assistant Attorney  General's decisions may be appealed to the Deputy Attorney General, who  will process appeals within 15 days of receipt of the appeal. The Deputy  Attorney General's decision is final and not subject to further  administrative appeal. Persons who are dissatisfied with the final  administrative decision may obtain judicial review either by filing an  action for declaratory relief, or by giving the Department notice of  their intention to proceed with publication despite the Department's  request for deletions of classified information and giving the  Department 30 working days to file a civil action seeking a court order  prohibiting disclosure. Employees and other affected individuals remain  obligated not to disclose or publish information determined by the  Government to be classified until any civil action is resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The obligations of Department of Justice employees described in  this subpart apply with equal force to employees of the FBI with  following exceptions and provisos:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nothing in this subpart shall supersede or alter obligations  assumed under the basic FBI employment agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FBI employees required to sign nondisclosure agreements  containing a provision for prepublication review pursuant to this  subpart shall submit materials for review to the Section Chief, Records/ Information Dissemination Section, Records Management Division. Such  individuals shall also submit questions as to whether specific materials  require prepublication review under such agreements to that Section for  resolution. Where such questions raise policy questions or concern  significant issues of interpretation under such an agreement, the  Section Chief, Records/Information Dissemination Section, Records  Management Division, shall consult with the Assistant Attorney General  for National Security, or a designee, prior to responding to the  inquiry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decisions of the Section Chief, Records/Information  Dissemination Section, Records Management Division, concerning the  deletion of classified information, may be appealed to the Director,  FBI, who will process appeals within 15 working days of receipt. Persons  who are dissatisfied with the Director's decision may, at their option,  appeal further to the Deputy Attorney General as provided in paragraph  (i) of this section. Judicial review, as set forth in that paragraph, is  available following final agency action in the form of a decision by the  Director, if the appeal process in paragraph   (i) of this section is pursued, the Deputy Attorney General.  [Order No. 2091-97, 62 FR 36984, July 10, 1997, as amended by Order No.  2865-2007, 72 FR 10069, Mar. 7, 2007]</p>
