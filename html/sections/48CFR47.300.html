The terms and conditions contained in this subpart are applicable to fixed-price contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a special requirement exists for application of any of these terms and conditions to other types of contracts; e.g., cost-reimbursement contracts, for which transportation arrangements are normally the responsibility of the contractor and transportation costs are allowable, the contracting officer shall use the terms and conditions prescribed in this subpart as a guide for (1) contract coverage of transportation and (2) instructions to the contractor to minimize the ultimate transportation costs to the Government.
