                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Charging interest. HUD will begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. A fee received by HUD, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charge for unsuccessful search. Ordinarily no charge for search time will be assessed when the records requested are not found or when the records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees shall be charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of Debt Collection Act of 1982. When a requester has failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), HUD may, under the authority of the Debt Collection Act and part 17, subpart C of this title, use consumer reporting agencies and collection agencies, where appropriate, to recover the indebtedness owed the Department.
