                            <p class="depth0">A report of availability will be prepared by the installation commander or head of the special staff agency, when it is determined that for the time being the real estate is not required for Army use and can be made available, either concurrently with the Army, or exclusively, for use by another military department, by other Federal agencies, by State or local governmental agencies, private organizations or individuals. The installation commander's recommendation will be made as far in advance as possible so as to minimize the time lapse between the determination of availability and the date of use of the property by the grantee. Where real estate suitable for agricultural or grazing purposes is involved, the normal season for planting and grazing should be taken into consideration so that the property may be advertised in a timely manner. A copy of each report will be furnished to the appropriate DE for information. The report of availability will contain the information outlined in appendix C.</p>
