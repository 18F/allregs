                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditional withholding. An agency or the Service shall conditionally withhold requests for official services when an applicant fails to meet any requirement prescribed in Sec. 800.46.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure and withholding. When an agency or the Service proposes to conditionally withhold official services, the applicant shall be notified of the reason for the proposed action. The applicant will then be afforded reasonable time to take corrective action or to show that there is no basis for withholding services. If the agency or the Service determines that corrective action has not been adequate, the applicant will be notified. Any results of official services shall not be released when a request for service is withheld.
