                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Weekly salary. If the employee is employed solely on a weekly  salary basis, the regular hourly rate of pay, on which time and a half  must be paid, is computed by dividing the salary by the number of hours  which the salary is intended to compensate. If an employee is hired at a  salary of $350 and if it is understood that this salary is compensation  for a regular workweek of 35 hours, the employee's regular rate of pay  is $350 divided by 35 hours, or $10 an hour, and when the employee works  overtime the employee is entitled to receive $10 for each of the first  40 hours and $15 (one and one-half times $10) for each hour thereafter.  If an employee is hired at a salary of $375 for a 40-hour week the  regular rate is $9.38 an hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Salary for periods other than workweek. Where the salary covers  a period longer than a workweek, such as a month, it must be reduced to  its workweek equivalent. A monthly salary is subject to translation to  its equivalent weekly wage by multiplying by 12 (the number of months)  and dividing by 52 (the number of weeks). A semimonthly salary is  translated into its equivalent weekly wage by multiplying by 24 and  dividing by 52. Once the weekly wage is arrived at, the regular hourly  rate of pay will be calculated as indicated above. The regular rate of  an employee who is paid a regular monthly salary of $1,560, or a regular  semimonthly salary of $780 for 40 hours a week, is thus found to be $9  per hour. Under regulations of the Administrator, pursuant to the  authority given to him in section 7(g)(3) of the Act, the parties may  provide that the regular rates shall be determined by dividing the  monthly salary by the number of working days in the month and then by  the number of hours of the normal or regular workday. Of course, the  resultant rate in   such a case must not be less than the statutory minimum wage.  [46 FR 7310, Jan. 23, 1981, as amended at 76 FR 18857, Apr. 5, 2011]</p>
