                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This subpart H implements uniform financial reporting standards for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Public housing agencies (PHAs) receiving assistance under sections 5, 9, or 14 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437c, 1437g, and 1437l) (Public Housing);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> PHAs as contract administrators for any Section 8 project-based or tenant-based housing assistance payments program, which includes assistance under the following programs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 8 project-based housing assistance payments programs, including, but not limited to, the Section 8 New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, Loan Management Set-Aside, Property Disposition, and Moderate Rehabilitation (including the Single Room Occupancy program for homeless individuals);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 8 Project-Based Certificate programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any program providing Section 8 project-based renewal contracts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 8 tenant-based assistance under the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Owners of housing assisted under any Section 8 project-based housing assistance payments program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Including, but not limited to, the Section 8 New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, Loan Management Set-Aside, and Property Disposition programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excluding the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program (which includes the Single Room Occupancy program for homeless individuals) and the Section 8 Project-Based Certificate Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Owners of multifamily projects receiving direct or indirect assistance from HUD, or with mortgages insured, coinsured, or held by HUD, including but not limited to housing under the following HUD programs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 202 Program of Supportive Housing for the Elderly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 202 loan program for projects for the elderly and handicapped (including 202/8 projects and 202/162 projects);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 207 of the National Housing Act (NHA) (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)

Entities (or individuals) to which this subpart is applicable must provide to HUD such financial information as required by HUD. Such information must be provided on an annual basis, except as required more frequently under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. This information must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as further defined by HUD in supplementary guidance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Submitted electronically to HUD through the internet, or in such other electronic format designated by HUD, or in such non-electronic format as HUD may allow if the burden or cost of electronic reporting is determined by HUD to be excessive; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submitted in such form and substance as prescribed by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With respect to financial reports relating to properties insured under section 232 of the Act, concurrently with submitting the information to HUD, submitted to the mortgagee in a format and manner prescribed and/or approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Filing of financial reports. (1) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 60 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law (for public housing agencies, see also 24 CFR 903.33).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For those entities listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year (or within an extended time if an extension is granted at the sole discretion of the Secretary). An extension request must be received no earlier than 45 days and no later than 15 days prior to the submission deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to HUD on a quarterly and fiscal-year-to-date basis, within 60 calendar days of the end of each quarterly reporting period deadline, except that the final fiscal-year-end quarter and fiscal-year-to-date reports must be submitted to HUD within 90 calendar days of the end of the fiscal-year-end quarter, or within such additional time as may be provided by the Commissioner for good cause shown. HUD may direct that such forms be submitted to the lender or another third party in addition to or in lieu of submission to HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The financial statements submitted by entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section may, at the operator's option, be operator-certified rather than audited, provided, however, if the operator is also the borrower, then that entity's obligation to submit an annual audited financial statement (in addition to its obligation as an operator to submit financial information on a quarterly and year-to-date basis) remains and is not obviated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If HUD has reason to believe that a particular operator's operator-certified statements may be unreliable

(for example, indicate a likely prohibited use of project funds), or are presented in a manner that is inconsistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, require audited financial statements from the operator. With respect to facilities with FHA-insured or HUD-held Section 232 mortgages, HUD may request more frequent financial statements from the borrower and/or the operator on a case-by-case basis when the circumstances warrant. Nothing in this section limits HUD's ability to obtain further or more frequent information when appropriate pursuant to the applicable regulatory agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reporting compliance dates. Entities (or individuals) that are subject to the reporting requirements in this section must commence compliance with these requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For PHAs listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the requirements of this section will begin with those PHAs with fiscal years ending September 30, 1999 and later. Unaudited financial statements will be required 60 days after the PHA's fiscal year end, and audited financial statements will then be required no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and OMB Circular A-133 (See 24 CFR 84.26). A PHA with a fiscal year ending September 30, 1999 that elects to submit its unaudited financial report earlier than the due date of November 30, 1999 must submit its report as required in this section. On or after September 30, 1998, but prior to November 30, 1999 (except for a PHA with its fiscal year ending September 30, 1999), PHAs may submit their financial reports in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, the requirements of this section will begin with those entities with fiscal years ending December 31, 1998 and later. Entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section with fiscal years ending December 31, 1998 that elect to submit their reports earlier than the due date must submit their financial reports as required in this section. On or after September 30, 1998 but prior to January 1, 1999, these entities may submit their financial reports in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requirements of this section apply to the entities listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section with fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2002. Audited financial statements submitted by lenders with fiscal years ending before September 30, 2002, may either be submitted in paper or electronically at the lenders' option. Audited financial statements submitted by lenders with fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2002, must be submitted electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Entities described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must comply with the requirements of this section with respect to fiscal years commencing on or after the date that is 60 calendar days after the date on which HUD announces, through Federal Register notice, that it has issued guidance on the manner in which these reports will be transmitted to HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on changing fiscal years. To allow for a period of consistent assessment of the financial reports submitted to HUD under this subpart part, PHAs listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section will not be allowed to change their fiscal years for their first three full fiscal years following October 1, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Responsibility for submission of financial report. The responsibility for submission of the financial report due to HUD under this section rests with the individuals and entities listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
