                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State must expend and account for grant funds in accordance  with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own  funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as  its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permit the preparation of reports required by 49 CFR part 18 and  this part, including the tracing of funds provided for planning to a  level of expenditure adequate to establish that at least 75 percent of  the funds provided were made available to LEPCs for developing,  improving, and implementing emergency plans; and the tracing of funds  provided for training to a level of expenditure adequate to establish  that at least 75 percent of the funds provided were made available for  the purposes of training public sector employees employed or used by  political subdivisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditure adequate  to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the  restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The financial management systems of Indian tribes and any  subgrantees must meet the standards of 49 CFR 18.20, including the  ability to trace funds provided for training to a level of expenditure  adequate to establish that at least 75 percent of the funds provided  were made available for the purposes of training public sector employees  employed or used by political subdivisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advances shall be made to States and Indian tribes consistent  with 49 CFR part 18 and 31 CFR part 205. The Associate Administrator  shall base these advances on demonstrated need, which will be determined  on a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as State/Tribal budget  constraints and reductions in amounts budgeted for hazardous materials  activities. To obtain an advance, a State or Indian tribe must comply  with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A letter from the Governor or Tribal leader or their designee is  required specifying the extenuating circumstances requiring the funding  advance for the grant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum advance request may not be more than $25,000 for  each State or Indian tribe;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recipients of advance funding must obligate those funds within 3  months of receipt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advances including interest will be deducted from the initial  reimbursement to the State or Indian tribe; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The State or Indian tribe will have its allocation of current  grant funds reduced and will not be permitted to apply for future grant  funds until the advance is covered by a request for reimbursement. For  example, if $25,000 is advanced for personnel costs, this advance would  be deducted from the initial reimbursement in the year the advance was  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To be allowable, costs must be eligible, reasonable, necessary,  and allocable to the approved project in accordance with OMB Circular A- 87 and included in the grant award. Costs incurred prior to the award of  any grant are not allowable. Recipient agencies are responsible for  obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (31  U.S.C. 7501), 49 CFR part 90, and OMB Circular A-128. Audits shall be  made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards covering financial and compliance audits.  The Associate Administrator may audit a recipient agency at any time.  [Amdt. 110-1, 57 FR 43067, Sept. 17, 1992, as amended by 66 FR 45377,  Aug. 28, 2001]</p>
