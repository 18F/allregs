                            <p class="depth0">The lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan and all collateral securing the loan in bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lender's responsibilities. It is the lender's responsibility to protect the guaranteed loan debt and all of the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These responsibilities include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender will file a proof of claim where necessary and all the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender will attend and, where necessary, participate in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request modification of any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that additional recoveries are likely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Agency will be kept adequately and regularly informed in writing of all aspects of the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In a Chapter 11 reorganization, if an independent appraisal of collateral is necessary in the Agency's opinion, the Agency and the lender will share such appraisal fee equally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports of loss during bankruptcy. When the loan is involved in reorganization proceedings, payment of loss claims may be made as provided in this section. For a liquidation proceeding, only paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section are applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Estimated loss payments. (i) If a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Code for a reorganization (but not Chapter 13) and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender will request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. Only one estimated loss payment is allowed during the reorganization. All subsequent claims of the lender during reorganization will be considered revisions to the initial estimated loss. A revised estimated loss payment may be processed by the Agency, at its option, in accordance with any court-approved changes in the reorganization plan. Once the reorganization plan has been completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court-ordered interest-rate reduction under the terms of the reorganization plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Code for a reorganization (but not Chapter 13) and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender will request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court.

The estimated loss claim, as well as any revisions to this claim, will be accompanied by documentation to support the claim.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon completion of a reorganization plan, the lender will complete a Form FmHA 1980-44 and forward this form to the Finance Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest loss payments. (i) Interest losses sustained during the period of the reorganization plan will be processed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest losses sustained during the period of the reorganization plan will be processed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interest losses sustained after the reorganization plan is completed will be processed annually when the lender

sustains a loss as a result of a permanent interest rate reduction which extends beyond the period of the reorganization plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the Chapter 11 reorganization plan and the borrower repays in full the remaining balance without an additional loss sustained by the lender, a final report of loss is not necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Final loss payments. Final loss payments will be processed when the loan is liquidated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment application. The lender must apply estimated loss payments first to the unsecured principal of the guaranteed portion of the debt and then to the unsecured interest of the guaranteed portion of the debt. In the event a bankruptcy court attempts to direct the payments to be applied in a different manner, the lender will immediately notify the Agency servicing office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Overpayments. Upon completion of the reorganization plan, the lender will provide the Agency with the documentation necessary to determine whether the estimated loss paid equals the actual loss sustained. If the actual loss sustained as a result of the reorganization is less than the estimated loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of payment of the estimated loss. If the actual loss is greater than the estimated loss payment, the lender will submit a revised estimated loss in order to obtain payment of the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Protective advances. If approved protective advances were made prior to the borrower having filed bankruptcy, these protective advances and accrued interest will be considered in the loss calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Legal expenses during bankruptcy proceedings. (1) When a bankruptcy proceeding results in a liquidation of the borrower by a trustee, legal expenses will be handled as directed by the court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a bankruptcy proceeding results in a liquidation of the borrower by a trustee, legal expenses will be handled as directed by the court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business contemplating an ongoing business rather than a termination and dissolution of the business where legal protection is afforded to the business as defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11 reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unless the proceeding becomes a Chapter 11 liquidation. If the proceeding should become a Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted from proceeds of collateral as provided in the Lender's Agreement. Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the borrower's assets. If, and when, liquidation of the borrower's assets under Chapter 7 is conducted by the bankruptcy trustee, then the lender cannot claim expenses.
