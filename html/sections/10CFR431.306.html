If the panel contains framing members (e.g. a wood frame) then the width of the edge region must be as wide as any framing member plus 2 in. 0.25 in. If the panel does not contain framing members then the width of the edge region must be 4 in 0.25 in. For walk-in panels that utilize vacuum insulated panels (VIP) for insulation, the width of the edge region must be the lesser of 4.5 in. 1 in. or the maximum width that does not cause the VIP to be pierced by the cutting device when the edge region is cut.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Surface area means the area of the surface of the walk-in component that would be external to the walk-in. For example, for panel, the surface area would be the area of the side of the panel that faces the outside of the walk-in. It would not include edges of the panel that are not exposed to the outside of the walk-in.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Rating conditions means, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all conditions shown in Table A.1. For installations where two or more walk-in envelope components share any surface(s), the ``external conditions'' of the shared surface(s) must reflect the internal conditions of the adjacent walk-in. For example, if a walk-in component divides a walk-in freezer from a walk-in cooler, then the internal conditions are the freezer rating conditions and the external conditions are the cooler rating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Percent time off (PTO) means the percent of time that an electrical device is assumed to be off.</p><p class="depth0">Table A.1--Temperature Conditions------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Internal Temperatures (cooled space within the envelope)------------------------------------------------------------------------Cooler Dry Bulb Temperature...................  35 [deg]F.Freezer Dry Bulb Temperature..................  -10 [deg]F.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">External Temperatures (space external to the envelope)------------------------------------------------------------------------Freezer and Cooler Dry Bulb Temperatures......  75 [deg]F.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Subfloor Temperatures------------------------------------------------------------------------Freezer and Cooler Dry Bulb Temperatures......  55 [deg]F.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Calculation Instructions</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Display Panels</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculate the U-factor of the display panel in accordance with section 5.3 of this appendix, Btu/h-ft\2\- [deg]F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculate the display panel surface area, as defined in section 3.4 of this appendix, Adp, ft\2\, with standard geometric formulas or engineering software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculate the temperature differential, [Delta]Tdp, [deg]F, for the display panel, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JN11.003
