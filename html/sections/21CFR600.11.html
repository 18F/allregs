                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Work areas. All rooms and work areas where products are  manufactured or stored shall be kept orderly, clean, and free of dirt,  dust, vermin and objects not required for manufacturing. Precautions  shall be taken to avoid clogging and back-siphonage of drainage systems.  Precautions shall be taken to exclude extraneous infectious agents from  manufacturing areas. Work rooms shall be well lighted and ventilated.  The ventilation system shall be arranged so as to prevent the  dissemination of microorganisms from one manufacturing area to another  and to avoid other conditions unfavorable to the safety of the product.  Filling rooms, and other rooms where open, sterile operations are  conducted, shall be adequate to meet manufacturing needs and such rooms  shall be constructed and equipped to permit thorough cleaning and to  keep air-borne   contaminants at a minimum. If such rooms are used for other purposes,  they shall be cleaned and prepared prior to use for sterile operations.  Refrigerators, incubators and warm rooms shall be maintained at  temperatures within applicable ranges and shall be free of extraneous  material which might affect the safety of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equipment. Apparatus for sterilizing equipment and the method of  operation shall be such as to insure the destruction of contaminating  microorganisms. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure shall  be no less than that achieved by an attained temperature of 121.5 [deg]C  maintained for 20 minutes by saturated steam or by an attained  temperature of 170 [deg]C maintained for 2 hours with dry heat.  Processing and storage containers, filters, filling apparatus, and other  pieces of apparatus and accessory equipment, including pipes and tubing,  shall be designed and constructed to permit thorough cleaning and, where  possible, inspection for cleanliness. All surfaces that come in contact  with products shall be clean and free of surface solids, leachable  contaminants, and other materials that will hasten the deterioration of  the product or otherwise render it less suitable for the intended use.  For products for which sterility is a factor, equipment shall be  sterile, unless sterility of the product is assured by subsequent  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Laboratory and bleeding rooms. Rooms used for the processing of  products, including bleeding rooms, shall be effectively fly-proofed and  kept free of flies and vermin. Such rooms shall be so constructed as to  insure freedom from dust, smoke and other deleterious substances and to  permit thorough cleaning and disinfection. Rooms for animal injection  and bleeding, and rooms for smallpox vaccine animals, shall be  disinfected and be provided with the necessary water, electrical and  other services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Animal quarters and stables. Animal quarters, stables and food  storage areas shall be of appropriate construction, fly-proofed,  adequately lighted and ventilated, and maintained in a clean, vermin- free and sanitary condition. No manure or refuse shall be stored as to  permit the breeding of flies on the premises, nor shall the  establishment be located in close proximity to off-property manure or  refuse storage capable of engendering fly breeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions on building and equipment use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Work of a  diagnostic nature. Laboratory procedures of a clinical diagnostic nature  involving materials that may be contaminated, shall not be performed in  space used for the manufacture of products except that manufacturing  space which is used only occasionally may be used for diagnostic work  provided spore-forming pathogenic microorganisms are not involved and  provided the space is thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before the  manufacture of products is resumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Spore-forming organisms for supplemental sterilization procedure  control test. Spore-forming organisms used as an additional control in  sterilization procedures may be introduced into areas used for the  manufacture of products, only for the purposes of the test and only  immediately before use for such purposes: Provided, That (i) the  organism is not pathogenic for man or animals and does not produce  pyrogens or toxins, (ii) the culture is demonstrated to be pure, (iii)  transfer of test cultures to culture media shall be limited to the  sterility test area or areas designated for work with spore-forming  organisms, (iv) each culture be labeled with the name of the  microorganism and the statement ``Caution: microbial spores. See  directions for storage, use and disposition.'', and (v) the container of  each culture is designed to withstand handling without breaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Work with spore-forming microorganisms. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturing  processes using spore-forming microorganisms conducted in a multiproduct  manufacturing site must be performed under appropriate controls to  prevent contamination of other products and areas within the site.  Prevention of spore contamination can be achieved by using a separate  dedicated building or by using process containment if manufacturing is  conducted in a multiproduct manufacturing building. All product and  personnel movement between the area where the spore-forming  microorganisms are manufactured   and other manufacturing areas must be conducted under conditions that  will prevent the introduction of spores into other areas of the  facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If process containment is employed in a multiproduct  manufacturing area, procedures must be in place to demonstrate adequate  removal of the spore-forming microorganism(s) from the manufacturing  area for subsequent manufacture of other products. These procedures must  provide for adequate removal or decontamination of the spore-forming  microorganisms on and within manufacturing equipment, facilities, and  ancillary room items as well as the removal of disposable or product  dedicated items from the manufacturing area. Environmental monitoring  specific for the spore-forming microorganism(s) must be conducted in  adjacent areas during manufacturing operations and in the manufacturing  area after completion of cleaning and decontamination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Live vaccine processing. Live vaccine processing must be  performed under appropriate controls to prevent cross contamination of  other products and other manufacturing areas within the building.  Appropriate controls must include, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Using a dedicated manufacturing area that is either in a  separate building, in a separate wing of a building, or in quarters at  the blind end of a corridor and includes adequate space and equipment  for all processing steps up to, but not including, filling into final  containers; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Not conducting test procedures that potentially involve the  presence of microorganisms other than the vaccine strains or the use of  tissue culture cell lines other than primary cultures in space used for  processing live vaccine; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If manufacturing is conducted in a multiproduct manufacturing  building or area, using procedural controls, and where necessary,  process containment. Process containment is deemed to be necessary  unless procedural controls are sufficient to prevent cross contamination  of other products and other manufacturing areas within the building.  Process containment is a system designed to mechanically isolate  equipment or an area that involves manufacturing using live vaccine  organisms. All product, equipment, and personnel movement between  distinct live vaccine processing areas and between live vaccine  processing areas and other manufacturing areas, up to, but not  including, filling in final containers, must be conducted under  conditions that will prevent cross contamination of other products and  manufacturing areas within the building, including the introduction of  live vaccine organisms into other areas. In addition, written procedures  and effective processes must be in place to adequately remove or  decontaminate live vaccine organisms from the manufacturing area and  equipment for subsequent manufacture of other products. Written  procedures must be in place for verification that processes to remove or  decontaminate live vaccine organisms have been followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Equipment and supplies--contamination. Equipment and supplies  used in work on or otherwise exposed to any pathogenic or potentially  pathogenic agent shall be kept separated from equipment and supplies  used in the manufacture of products to the extent necessary to prevent  cross-contamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Animals used in manufacture--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Care of animals used in  manufacturing. Caretakers and attendants for animals used for the  manufacture of products shall be sufficient in number and have adequate  experience to insure adequate care. Animal quarters and cages shall be  kept in sanitary condition. Animals on production shall be inspected  daily to observe response to production procedures. Animals that become  ill for reasons not related to production shall be isolated from other  animals and shall not be used for production until recovery is complete.  Competent veterinary care shall be provided as needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarantine of animals--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. No animal shall be used in  processing unless kept under competent daily inspection and preliminary  quarantine for a period of at least 7 days before use, or as otherwise  provided in this subchapter. Only healthy animals free from detectable  communicable diseases shall be used. Animals must remain in   overt good health throughout the quarantine periods and particular care  shall be taken during the quarantine periods to reject animals of the  equine genus which may be infected with glanders and animals which may  be infected with tuberculosis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quarantine of monkeys. In addition to observing the pertinent  general quarantine requirements, monkeys used as a source of tissue in  the manufacture of vaccine shall be maintained in quarantine for at  least 6 weeks prior to use, except when otherwise provided in this part.  Only monkeys that have reacted negatively to tuberculin at the start of  the quarantine period and again within 2 weeks prior to use shall be  used in the manufacture of vaccine. Due precaution shall be taken to  prevent cross-infection from any infected or potentially infected  monkeys on the premises. Monkeys to be used in the manufacture of a live  vaccine shall be maintained throughout the quarantine period in cages  closed on all sides with solid materials except the front which shall be  screened, with no more than two monkeys housed in one cage. Cage mates  shall not be interchanged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immunization against tetanus. Horses and other animals  susceptible to tetanus, that are used in the processing steps of the  manufacture of biological products, shall be treated adequately to  maintain immunity to tetanus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Immunization and bleeding of animals used as a source of  products. Toxins or other nonviable antigens administered in the  immunization of animals used in the manufacture of products shall be  sterile. Viable antigens, when so used, shall be free of contaminants,  as determined by appropriate tests prior to use. Injections shall not be  made into horses within 6 inches of bleeding site. Horses shall not be  bled for manufacturing purposes while showing persistent general  reaction or local reaction near the site of bleeding. Blood shall not be  used if it was drawn within 5 days of injecting the animals with viable  microorganisms. Animals shall not be bled for manufacturing purposes  when they have an intercurrent disease. Blood intended for use as a  source of a biological product shall be collected in clean, sterile  vessels. When the product is intended for use by injection, such vessels  shall also be pyrogen-free.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reporting of certain diseases. In cases of actual or suspected  infection with foot and mouth disease, glanders, tetanus, anthrax, gas  gangrene, equine infectious anemia; equine encephalomyelitis, or any of  the pock diseases among animals intended for use or used in the  manufacture of products, the manufacturer shall immediately notify the  Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research or the Director,  Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (see mailing addresses in Sec.  600.2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Monkeys used previously for experimental or test purposes.  Monkeys that have been used previously for experimental or test purposes  with live microbiological agents shall not be used as a source of kidney  tissue for the manufacture of vaccine. Except as provided otherwise in  this subchapter, monkeys that have been used previously for other  experimental or test purposes may be used as a source of kidney tissue  upon their return to a normal condition, provided all quarantine  requirements have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Necropsy examination of monkeys. Each monkey used in the  manufacture of vaccine shall be examined at necropsy under the direction  of a qualified pathologist, physician, or veterinarian having experience  with diseases of monkeys, for evidence of ill health, particularly for  (i) evidence of tuberculosis, (ii) presence of herpes-like lesions,  including eruptions or plaques on or around the lips, in the buccal  cavity or on the gums, and (iii) signs of conjunctivitis. If there are  any such signs or other significant gross pathological lesions, the  tissue shall not be used in the manufacture of vaccine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Filling procedures. Filling procedures shall be such as will not  affect adversely the safety, purity or potency of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Containers and closures. All final containers and closures shall  be made of material that will not hasten the deterioration of the  product or otherwise render it less suitable for the intended use. All  final containers and closures shall be clean and free of surface solids,   leachable contaminants and other materials that will hasten the  deterioration of the product or otherwise render it less suitable for  the intended use. After filling, sealing shall be performed in a manner  that will maintain the integrity of the product during the dating  period. In addition, final containers and closures for products intended  for use by injection shall be sterile and free from pyrogens. Except as  otherwise provided in the regulations of this subchapter, final  containers for products intended for use by injection shall be colorless  and sufficiently transparent to permit visual examination of the  contents under normal light. As soon as possible after filling final  containers shall be labeled as prescribed in Sec. 610.60 et seq. of  this chapter, except that final containers may be stored without such  prescribed labeling provided they are stored in a sealed receptacle  labeled both inside and outside with at least the name of the product,  the lot number, and the filling identification.
