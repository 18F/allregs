                            <p class="depth0">If you are a savings association and your portfolio exceeds any of the thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section, OTS will calculate your complexity component according to paragraph (c) of this section. If your portfolio does not exceed any of the thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section, your complexity component is zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Thresholds for complexity component. OTS uses three separate thresholds in calculating your complexity component. You exceed a threshold if you have more than $1 billion in any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trust assets that you administer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The outstanding principal balances of assets that are covered, fully or partially, by your recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The principal amount of loans that you service for others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment rates. OTS will establish one or more assessment rates for each of the types of activities listed in paragraph (a) of this section. OTS will publish those assessment rates in a Thrift Bulletin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of complexity component. OTS separately considers each of the thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section in calculating your complexity component. OTS first calculates the amount by which you exceed any of those thresholds. OTS multiplies the amount by which you exceed any thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section by the applicable assessment rate(s) under paragraph (b) of this section. OTS then totals the results. This total is your complexity component.</p><p class="depth2">Savings and Loan Holding Companies--Calculation of Assessments</p>
