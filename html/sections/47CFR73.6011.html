                            <p class="depth0">Class A TV stations must protect authorized TV broadcast stations, applications for minor changes in authorized TV broadcast stations filed on or before November 29, 1999, and applications for new TV broadcast stations that had been cut-off without competing applications or that were the winning bidder in a TV broadcast station auction as of that date, or that were the proposed remaining applicant in a group of mutually-exclusive applications for which a settlement agreement was on file as of that date. Protection of these stations and applications must be based on the requirements specified in Sec.  74.705 of this chapter. An application to change the facilities of an existing Class A TV station will not be accepted if it fails to protect these TV broadcast stations and applications pursuant to the requirements specified in Sec.  74.705 of this chapter.</p>
