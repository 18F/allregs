                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of this section. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Organizational conflicts of interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The non-Federal entity must conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The non-Federal entity must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a ``brand name or equivalent'' description may be used as a means to define the performance

or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers must be clearly stated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The non-Federal entity must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, the non-Federal entity must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.
