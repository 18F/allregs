                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any scholarship grant made to any individual under this subpart shall be awarded upon the condition that such individual will, following completion of his professional training, engage in the full-time practice of primary care for a period of 12 continuous months for each academic year (i.e., 9 months) for which a scholarship grant was made, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of any individual selected pursuant to Sec.  57.2205(a) (1) or (2), such practice must be in the physician shortage area to which such individual agreed to return: Provided however, That if the Secretary determines at the time the individual proposes to engage in the required practice that such area is no longer a physician shortage area and cannot reasonably be expected to become such an area within 2 years from such time, such practice shall, at the option of the individual, be either in any then current physician shortage area, or in such place or places, facility, or facilities, and in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of any individual selected pursuant to Sec.  57.2205(a) (3) or (4), such practice must be in accordance with the agreement described in Sec.  57.2205(b)(2) (i.e., in a physician shortage area with a substantial portion of migratory agricultural workers in such area; a physician shortage area; or in such place or places, facility or facilities, and in such manner as may be necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families; as the case may be).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to the provision of Sec.  57.2211(f) and except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any individual to whom the conditions of this section apply must complete the practice required by paragraph (a) of this section within a period beginning on the date of completion by the individual of his professional training, as determined by the Secretary, and not to exceed the period of practice determined in accordance with such paragraph (a) of this section, plus 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where an individual to whom the conditions of this section apply is currently performing an active duty service obligation under section 235 of the Act, the individual must complete the practice required by paragraph (a) of this section within a period beginning on the date of completion by the individual of his service obligation under section 225 of the Act or completion of his internship and residency training (not to exceed four years) if not previously received, whichever comes later, and not to exceed the period of practice determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, plus 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where an individual has received scholarship grant support for four academic years, such individual shall be considered to have received scholarship grant support for only three academic years if the Secretary determines (1) that such individual has served his internship or residency in a hospital (i) which is located in a physician shortage area, or (ii) in which a substantial portion of the patients of such hospital consists of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of the families of such workers and (2) that while so serving such internship or residency, he has received training or professional experience designed to prepare him to engage in the practice of primary care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, (1) internships which will be recognized by the Secretary as providing training or professional experience designed to prepare an individual to engage in the practice of primary care are: Rotating internships without a major emphasis, rotating internships with an emphasis on internal medicine, rotating internships with an emphasis on pediatrics, rotating internships with an emphasis on obstetrics and gynecology, straight internships in internal medicine, straight internships in pediatrics and straight internships in obstetrics and gynecology; Provided, That such internships are approved or provisionally approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association or the Board of Trustees of the American Osteopathic Association; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> internships which will be recognized by the Secretary as providing training or professional experience designed to prepare an individual to engage in the practice of primary care are: Rotating internships without a major emphasis, rotating internships with an emphasis on internal medicine, rotating internships with an emphasis on pediatrics, rotating internships with an emphasis on obstetrics and gynecology, straight internships in internal medicine, straight internships in pediatrics and straight internships in obstetrics and gynecology; Provided, That such internships are approved or provisionally approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association or the Board of Trustees of the American Osteopathic Association; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Residencies which will be recognized as providing such training or experience are those in general practice, family practice, general internal medicine, general pediatrics and general obstetrics and gynecology; Provided, That such residencies are approved or provisionally approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association or the Board of Trustees of the American Osteopathic Association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No individual who has received a scholarship grant under this subpart may enter into an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to section 741(f) of the Act until either (1) such individual has completed the practice required by paragraph (a) of this section, or (2) the Secretary has determined that the United States is entitled to recover from such individual an amount determined in accordance with Sec.  57.2210. In no case, however, shall a scholarship grant under this subpart be considered an educational loan for purposes of section 741(f) of the Act.
