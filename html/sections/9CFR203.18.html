                                Sec. 203.18  Statement with respect to packers engaging in the business
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the  Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (Packers and  Stockyards Programs) has sought to promote and maintain open and fair  competition in the livestock and packing industries, and to prevent  unfair or anticompetitive practices when they are found to exist. It is  the opinion of the Administration that the ownership or operation of  custom feedlots by packers presents problems which may, under some  circumstances, result in violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Packers contemplating entering into such arrangements with  custom feedlots are encouraged to consult with the Administration prior  to the commencement of such activities. Custom feedlots are not only  places of production, but are also important marketing centers, and in  connection with the operation of a custom feedlot, it is customary for  the feedlot operator to assume responsibility for marketing fed  livestock for the accounts of feedlot   customers. When a custom feedlot is owned or operated by a packer, and  when such packer purchases fed livestock from the feedlot, this method  of operation potentially gives rise to a conflict of interest. In such  situations, the packer's interest in the fed livestock as a buyer is in  conflict with its obligations to feedlot customers to market their  livestock to the customer's best advantage. Under these circumstances,  the packer should take appropriate measures to eliminate any conflict of  interest. At a minimum, such measures should insure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That feedlot customers are fully advised of the common ties  between the feedlot and the packer, and of their rights and options with  respect to the marketing of their livestock;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That all feedlot customers are treated equally by the packer/ custom feedlot in connection with the marketing of fed livestock; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That marketing decisions rest solely with the feedlot customer  unless otherwise expressly agreed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Packer ownership or operation of custom feedlots may also give  rise to competitive problems in some situations. Packers contemplating  or engaging in the business of operating a custom feedlot should  carefully review their operations to assure that no restriction of  competition exists or is likely to occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration  (Packers and Stockyards Programs) does not consider the existence of  packer/custom feedlot relationships, by itself, to constitute a  violation of the Act. In the event it appears that a packer/custom  feedlot arrangement gives rise to a violation of the Act, an  investigation will be made on a case-by-case basis, and, where  warranted, appropriate action will be taken.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0580-0015)  (7 U.S.C. 203, 204, 207, 217a, 222 and 228)  [49 FR 33004, Aug. 20, 1984, as amended at 68 FR 75388, Dec. 31, 2003]</p>
