                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> As originally enacted in 1967, section 4(f)(2) of the Act provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As originally enacted in 1967, section 4(f)(2) of the Act provided:</p><p class="depth3">It shall not be unlawful * * * to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this Act, except that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual * * *.

The Department of Labor interpreted the provision as ``Authoriz[ing] involuntary retirement irrespective of age: Provided, That such retirement is pursuant to the terms of a retirement or pension plan meeting the requirements of section 4(f)(2).'' See 34 FR 9709 (June 21, 1969). The Department took the position that in order to meet the requirements of section 4(f)(2), the involuntary retirement provision had to be (i) contained in a bona fide pension or retirement plan, (ii) required by the terms of the plan and not optional, and (iii) essential to the plan's economic survival or to some other legitimate business purpose--i.e., the provision was not in the plan as the result of arbitrary discrimination on the basis of age.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As revised by the 1978 amendments, section 4(f)(2) was amended by adding the following clause at the end:</p><p class="depth3">and no such seniority system or employee benefit plan shall require or permit the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by section 12(a) of this Act because of the age of such individual * * *.




The Conference Committee Report expressly states that this amendment is intended ``to make absolutely clear one of the original purposes of this provision, namely, that the exception does not authorize an employer to require or permit involuntary retirement of an employee within the protected age group on account of age'' (H.R. Rept. No. 95-950, p. 8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The amendment applies to all new and existing seniority systems and employee benefit plans. Accordingly, any system or plan provision requiring or permitting involuntary retirement is unlawful, regardless of whether the provision antedates the 1967 Act or the 1978 amendments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amendment applies to all new and existing seniority systems and employee benefit plans. Accordingly, any system or plan provision requiring or permitting involuntary retirement is unlawful, regardless of whether the provision antedates the 1967 Act or the 1978 amendments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where lawsuits pending on the date of enactment (April 6, 1978) or filed thereafter challenge involuntary retirements which occurred either before or after that date, the amendment applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The amendment protects all individuals covered by section 12(a) of the Act. Section 12(a) was amended in October of 1986 by the Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-592, 100 Stat. 3342 (1986), which removed the age 70 limit. Section 12(a) provides that the Act's prohibitions shall be limited to individuals who are at least forty years of age. Accordingly, unless a specific exemption applies, an employer can no longer force retirement or otherwise discriminate on the basis of age against an individual because (s)he is 70 or older.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amendment protects all individuals covered by section 12(a) of the Act.

In that case, the amendment is effective on the termination of the agreement or January 1, 1990, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Neither section 4(f)(2) nor any other provision of the Act makes it unlawful for a plan to permit individuals to elect early retirement at a specified age at their own option. Nor is it unlawful for a plan to require early retirement for reasons other than age.
[46 FR 47726, Sept. 29, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 23811, June 25, 1987; 53 FR 5973, Feb. 29, 1988]</p>
