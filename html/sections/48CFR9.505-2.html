                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a contractor prepares and furnishes complete  specifications covering nondevelopmental items, to be used in a  competitive acquisition, that contractor shall not be allowed to furnish  these items, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor, for a  reasonable period of time including, at least, the duration of the  initial production contract. This rule shall not apply to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contractors that furnish at Government request specifications or  data regarding a product they provide, even though the specifications or  data may have been paid for separately or in the price of the product;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Situations in which contractors, acting as industry  representatives, help Government agencies prepare, refine, or coordinate  specifications, regardless of source, provided this assistance is  supervised and controlled by Government representatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a single contractor drafts complete specifications for  nondevelopmental equipment, it should be eliminated for a reasonable  time from competition for production based on the specifications. This  should be done in order to avoid a situation in which the contractor  could draft specifications favoring its own products or capabilities. In  this way the Government can be assured of getting unbiased advice as to  the content of the specifications and can avoid allegations of  favoritism in the award of production contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In development work, it is normal to select firms that have done  the most advanced work in the field. These firms can be expected to  design and develop around their own prior knowledge. Development  contractors can frequently start production earlier and more  knowledgeably than firms that did not participate in the development,  and this can affect the time and quality of production, both of which  are important to the Government. In many instances the Government may  have financed the development. Thus, while the development contractor  has a competitive advantage, it is an unavoidable one that is not  considered unfair; hence no prohibition should be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a contractor prepares, or assists in preparing, a work  statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services--or  provides material leading directly, predictably, and without delay to  such a work statement--that contractor may not supply the system, major  components of the system, or the services unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is the sole source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It has participated in the development and design work; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> More than one contractor has been involved in preparing the  work statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies should normally prepare their own work statements. When  contractor assistance is necessary, the contractor might often be in a  position to favor its own products or capabilities. To overcome the  possibility of bias, contractors are prohibited from supplying a system  or services acquired   on the basis of work statements growing out of their services, unless  excepted in subparagraph (1) above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, no prohibitions are  imposed on development and design contractors.</p>
