If all potential beneficiaries  are known but one or more beneficiaries (and not all) appear to be  missing, payment of part of the participant's account may be made to the  known beneficiaries. The lost or unidentified beneficiary's share may be  paid in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section at a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Abandoned account. If no beneficiaries of the account are  located, the account will be considered abandoned and the funds will  revert to the TSP. If there are multiple beneficiaries and one or more  of them refuses to cooperate in the Board's search for the missing  beneficiary, the missing beneficiary's share will be considered  abandoned. In such circumstances, the account can be reclaimed if the  missing beneficiary is found at a later date. However, earnings will not  be credited from the date the fund is abandoned. The TSP may require the  beneficiary to apply for the death benefit with a TSP form and submit  proof of identity and relationship to the participant.
