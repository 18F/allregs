Loans of arms and accouterments as included herein are not applicable to Army National Guard (ARNG).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commanding General, Armament Readiness Command (ARRCOM) (ATTN: DRSAR-MMS) has been designated by Commanding General, Materiel Development and Readiness Command (DARCOM), as being responsible for keeping a centralized serial number visibility record for all small arms made for the Army. ARRCOM maintains accountable property records for loans to organizations such as the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM); and for loans to non-DOD activities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Secret Service (USSS), United States Customer Service (USCS); or rifle clubs, educational institutions, and veterans' organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requests for loan of arms which are type classified standard (logistics control code A or B) will be filled with the lowest type classified items available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Borrowers of Army arms will be fully responsible for the care, custody, and proper use of loaned materiel.

The Secretary of the Army has further made the DCM similarly responsible for loans to institutions (schools).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Property transactions. US Army Armament Materiel Readiness Command (ARRCOM) will transfer accountability for materiel shipped to civilian rifle clubs and institutions to the DCM. The DCM will keep a mission stock record account for these items as shown in Army Regulation 710-2. In addition, the account will note all property transactions between the DCM and civilian rifle clubs and institutions as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Loan and return of arms and accouterments to (from) civilian rifle clubs and institutions will not be posted to the accountable record as loss or gain vouchers. They will be posted as ``loan transactions'' with the DCM retaining accountability. In addition to debit, credit, and adjustment voucher files, the DCM accountable property officer will keep a ``loan voucher'' file in two sections; e.g., ``active'' and ``terminated.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The active section (suspense for items on loan) will contain DD Form 1348-1 or a letter acknowledging receipt of the items. (The signature of the borrower will be according to paragraph (4) (v) or (vi) of this section.) This section will contain a folder for each activity serviced by the DCM. The active loan vouchers will be filed in National Stock Number and voucher number sequence. This section serves as the DCM loan record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terminated section (for items no longer on loan) will contain the original loan shipping document (loan voucher). The return receipt document which terminates the loan will be attached. The receipt document will contain the original shipping document number and the return advice code ``IQ.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shipments of expendable items (e.g., ammunition, targets, etc.) will be posted as a credit to the accountable record. Accountability will be dropped (These items are deemed to have been consumed at the time of issue).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Expendable items returned by rifle clubs and institutions will be posted to the accountable record as a debit voucher. The DCM will determine disposition of these items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requisition procedures. (i) The DCM will prepare requisitions based on information from the rifle clubs or institutions. DA Form 1273 (Requisition for Articles Authorized for Issue to Civilian Rifle Clubs) will be used. Two completed copies of the requisition will be sent to the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DCM will prepare requisitions based on information from the rifle clubs or institutions. DA Form 1273 (Requisition for Articles Authorized for Issue to Civilian Rifle Clubs) will be used. Two completed copies of the requisition will be sent to the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rifle club or institution will complete the form and return one signed copy to the DCM, HQDA, Secretary Field Directorate Marksmanship (SFDM), (para 7, app B) and keep one copy for file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On receipt of the signed copy of DA Form 1273, the DCM will take proper issue action. When more arms are required by the DCM, a DD Form 1348 will be prepared and sent to the Secretary of the Army for approval (AR 725-50).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The supply source responsible for the loan will ship the materiel directly to the rifle club or school.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> DD Forms 1348-1 received with the shipment or by mail, will be annotated and signed by the person authorized to receive and sign for property for the rifle club or school. The quantity and condition of the items received will be entered thereon. This entry will be based on a physical check and inspection of the materiel. Serial numbers of items received (if applicable and not noted) will also be entered. Two of the completed copies will be signed by the person authorized to sign for the club or institution. They will be mailed to the DCM, HQDA Secretary Field Directorate Marksmanship (SFDM). The third completed copy will be kept in the unit's file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If a DD Form 1348-1 is not received with the shipment or is not received by mail, a receipt letter will be sent to the DCM. It will set forth the nomenclature, quantities, condition, and serial numbers (of serial-numbered items) of all property received. This letter will be sent as soon as possible after receipt of the property. The receipt letter will be used by the DCM as a loan voucher. One copy will be recorded in the voucher register and placed in the voucher file. The loan action will be posted to the DCM stock record account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Property returns. When property is returned by civilian rifle clubs or institutions, the DCM will prepare seven copies of the DD Form 1348-1. Five copies will be mailed to the rifle club or institution; one will be kept in suspense in the club's or institution's jacket file; and one will be sent to the US Army Management Systems Support Agency (USAMSSA), Wash., DC 20310, to update the ``rifles intransit program.'' The rifle club or institution will enter on the five copies the shipment date, how shipped, the quantity shipped, and other necessary data not entered by the DCM and distribute the five copies as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two copies to the consignee (receiving depot, arsenal, or installation). One copy of the DD Form 1348-1 received by the consignee will be used to tally the shipment and to account for property received. The other copy will be signed by the accountable property officer (or representative) and will be sent to the DCM to terminate the open receipt in the loan voucher file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One copy with the shipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> One copy to the DCM, HQDA (SFDM), accompanied by the bill of lading (where available).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> One copy retained by the rifle club or institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Lost, damaged, or destroyed property. Loss, damage, or destruction of property in the possession of a rifle club or institution will be reported within 24 hours by telephone to the DCM (202-693-6460), the local police, and the FBI. All public and local laws must be complied with. Rifles and other equipment (except ammunition) that becomes unserviceable will be reported to the DCM by the club or institution. The DCM will give instructions for return of the equipment without expense to the government. Any equipment damage or loss that is the fault of the club or institution will be determined by a report of survey (AR 735-

11). The club or institution must then reimburse the DCM. The DCM may replace damaged equipment after reimbursement. Government property lost or destroyed without fault or neglect on the club's part will be replaced, if replacements are available. The club will pay only shipping and handling charges.
