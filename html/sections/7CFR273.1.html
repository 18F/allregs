                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General household definition. A household is composed of one of  the following individuals or groups of individuals, unless otherwise  specified in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual living alone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual living with others, but customarily purchasing  food and preparing meals for home consumption separate and apart from  others; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A group of individuals who live together and customarily  purchase food and prepare meals together for home consumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special household requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Required household  combinations. The following individuals who live with others must be  considered as customarily purchasing food and preparing meals with the  others, even if they do not do so, and thus must be included in the same  household, unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spouses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person under 22 years of age who is living with his or her  natural or adoptive parent(s) or step-parent(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A child (other than a foster child) under 18 years of age who  lives with and is under the parental control of a household member other  than his or her parent. A child must be considered to be under parental  control for purposes of this provision if he or she is financially or  otherwise dependent on a member of the household, unless State law  defines such a person as an adult.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Elderly and disabled persons. Notwithstanding the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section, an otherwise eligible member of a  household who is 60 years of age or older and is unable to purchase and  prepare meals because he or she suffers from a disability considered  permanent under the Social Security Act or a non disease-related,  severe, permanent disability may be considered, together with his or her  spouse (if living there), a separate household from the others with whom  the individual lives. Separate household status under this provision  must not be granted when the income of the others with whom the elderly  disabled individual resides (excluding the income of the elderly and  disabled individual and his or her spouse) exceeds 165 percent of the  poverty line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Boarders. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Residents of a commercial boarding house,  regardless of the number of residents, are not eligible to participate  in the Program. A commercial boarding house is an establishment licensed  to offer meals and lodging for compensation. It does not include any of  the entities listed in paragraph (b)(7)(vii) of this section. In project  areas without licensing requirements, a commercial boarding house is a  commercial establishment that offers meals and lodging for compensation  with the intent of making a profit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All other individuals or groups of individuals paying a  reasonable amount for meals or meals and lodging must be considered  boarders and are not eligible to participate in the Program  independently of the household providing the board. Such individuals or  groups of individuals may participate, along with a spouse or children   living with them, as members of the household providing the boarder  services, only at the request of the household providing the boarder  services. An individual paying less than a reasonable amount for board  must not be considered a boarder but must be considered, along with a  spouse or children living with him or her, as a member of the household  providing the board.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For individuals whose board arrangement is for more than two  meals per day, ``reasonable compensation'' must be an amount that equals  or exceeds the maximum food stamp allotment for the appropriate size of  the boarder household.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For individuals whose board arrangement is for two meals or less  per day, ``reasonable compensation'' must be an amount that equals or  exceeds two-thirds of the maximum food stamp allotment for the  appropriate size of the boarder household.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Boarders must not be considered to be residents of an  institution as outlined in paragraph (b)(7)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foster care individuals. Individuals placed in the home of  relatives or other individuals or families by a Federal, State, or local  governmental foster care program must be considered to be boarders. They  cannot participate in the Program independently of the household  providing the foster care services. Such foster care individuals may  participate, along with a spouse or children living with them, as  members of the household providing the foster care services, only at the  request of the household providing the foster care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Roomers. Individuals to whom a household furnishes lodging for  compensation, but not meals, may participate as separate households.  Persons described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must not be  considered roomers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Live-in attendants. A live-in attendant may participate as a  separate household. Persons described in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section must not be considered live-in attendants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Ineligible household members. The following persons are not  eligible to participate as separate households or as a member of any  household:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ineligible aliens and students as specified in Sec. Sec. 273.4  and 273.5, respectively;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SSI recipients in ``cash-out'' States as specified in  Sec. 273.20;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Individuals disqualified for noncompliance with the work  requirements of Sec. 273.7;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Individuals disqualified for failure to provide an SSN as  specified in Sec. 273.6;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Individuals disqualified for an intentional Program violation as  specified in Sec. 273.16; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Residents of an institution, with some exceptions. Individuals  must be considered residents of an institution when the institution  provides them with the majority of their meals (over 50 percent of three  meals daily) as part of the institution's normal services. Exceptions to  this requirement include only the individuals listed in paragraphs  (b)(7)(vii)(A) through (b)(7)(vii)(E) of this section. The individuals  listed in paragraphs (b)(7)(vii)(A) through (b)(7)(vii)(E) can  participate in the Program and must be treated as separate households  from the others with whom they reside, subject to the mandatory  household combination requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  unless otherwise stated:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Individuals who are residents of federally subsidized housing  for the elderly;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Individuals who are narcotic addicts or alcoholics and reside at  a facility or treatment center for the purpose of regular participation  in a drug or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation program. This includes  the children but not the spouses of such persons who live with them at  the treatment center or facility;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Individuals who are disabled or blind and are residents of group  living arrangements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Individual women or women with their children who are  temporarily residing in a shelter for battered women and children; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Individuals who are residents of public or private nonprofit  shelters for homeless persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Individuals who are ineligible under Sec. 273.11(m) because of  a drug-related felony conviction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At State agency option, individuals who are disqualified in  another assistance program in accordance with Sec. 273.11(k).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Individuals who are fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody for  a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, or who are violating a  condition of probation or parole who are ineligible under  Sec. 273.11(n).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Individuals disqualified for failure to cooperate with child  support enforcement agencies in accordance with Sec. 273.11(o) or (p),  or for being delinquent in any court-ordered child support obligation in  accordance with Sec. 273.11(q).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Persons ineligible under Sec. 273.24, the time limit for able- bodied adults.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unregulated situations. For situations that are not clearly  addressed by the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,  the State agency may apply its own policy for determining when an  individual is a separate household or a member of another household if  the policy is applied fairly, equitably and consistently throughout the  State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Head of household. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State agency shall not use the head of  household designation to impose special requirements on the household,  such as requiring that the head of household, rather than another  responsible member of the household, appear at the certification office  to make application for benefits. When designating the head of  household, the State agency shall allow the household to select an adult  parent of children (of any age) living in the household, or an adult who  has parental control over children (under 18 years of age) living in the  household, as the head of household provided that all adult household  members agree to the selection. The State agency shall permit such  households to select their head at each certification action or whenever  there is a change in household composition. The State agency shall  provide written notice to all households at the time of application and  as otherwise appropriate that specifies the household's right to select  its head of household in accordance with this paragraph. The written  notice shall identify which households have the option to select their  head of household, the circumstances under which a household may change  its designation of head of household, and how such changes must be  reported to the State agency. If all adult household members do not  agree to the selection or decline to select an adult parent as the head  of household, the State agency may designate the head of household or  permit the household to make another selection. In no event shall the  household's failure to select an adult parent of children or an adult  who has parental control over children as the head of household delay  the certification or result in the denial of benefits of an otherwise  eligible household. For households that do not consist of adult parents  and children or adults who have parental control of children living in  the household, the State agency shall designate the head of household or  permit the household to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of failure to comply with the work requirements of  Sec. 273.7, the head of household shall be the principal wage earner  unless the household has selected an adult parent of children as  specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The principal wage earner  shall be the household member (including excluded members) who is the  greatest source of earned income in the two months prior to the month of  the violation. This provision applies only if the employment involves 20  hours or more per week or provides weekly earnings at least equivalent  to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 20 hours. No person of any age  living with a parent or person fulfilling the role of a parent who is  registered for work or exempt from work registration requirements  because such parent or person fulfilling the role of a parent is subject  to and participating in any work requirement under title IV of the  Social Security Act, or in receipt of unemployment compensation (or has  registered for work as part of the application for or receipt of  unemployment compensation), or is employed or self-employed and working  a minimum of 30 hours weekly or receiving weekly earnings equal to the  Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours shall be considered the head  of household unless the person is an adult parent of children as  specified in Sec. 273.1(d)(1) and the household elects to designate the  adult parent as its head   of household. If there is no principal source of earned income in the  household, the household member, documented in the casefile as the head  of the household at the time of the violation, shall be considered the  head of household. The designation of head of household through the  circumstances of this paragraph shall take precedence over a previous  designation of head of household at least until the period of  ineligibility is ended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Strikers. Households with a striking member are not eligible to  participate in the Program, unless the household was eligible for  benefits the day before the strike and is otherwise eligible at the time  of application. A striker must be anyone involved in a strike or  concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason  of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) and any  concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by  employees. Any employee affected by a lockout, however, must not be  deemed to be a striker. Further, an individual who goes on strike but is  exempt from work registration under Sec. 273.7(b) the day before the  strike, other than those exempt solely on the grounds that they are  employed, must not be deemed to be a striker. Also, persons such as  truck drivers who cannot do their jobs because the strike has left them  with nothing to deliver, and employees who are not part of the  bargaining unit and do not want to cross the picket line for fear of  personal injury or death, must not be deemed to be strikers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-strike eligibility must be determined by considering the day  prior to the strike as the day of application and assuming the strike  did not occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility at the time of application must be determined by  comparing the striking member's income before the strike to the  striker's current income and adding the higher of the two to the current  income of non-striking members during the month of application. If the  household is eligible, the higher income figure must also be used in  determining the household's benefits.
