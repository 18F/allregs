                            <p class="depth0">Sections 3(s)(1) and 13(a)(2) of the amended Act as well as sections  3(s)(1), 3(s)(2), 3(s)(5), and 13(a)(2)(iv) of the prior Act provide for  the exclusion of ``excise taxes at the retail level which are separately  stated'' in computing the gross annual volume of sales or business or  the annual dollar volume of sales for purposes of certain of the  provisions contained in those sections. The Senate Committee report  states as follows with respect to this provision:  * * * in determining whether the enterprise or establishment, as the  case may be, has the requisite annual dollar volume of sales, excise  taxes will not be counted if they are taxes that are collected at the  retail level and are separately identified in the price charged the  customer for the goods or services at the time of the sale. Excise taxes  which are levied at the manufacturer's, wholesaler's, or other  distributive level will not be excluded in calculating the dollar volume  of sales nor will excise taxes be excluded in cases where the customer  is charged a single price for the merchandise or services and the taxes  are not separately identified when the sale is made. (S. Rept., 145,  87th Cong., first session, p. 39.)   In applying the above rules to determine annual gross volume of sales or  business under section 3(s) or annual dollar volume of sales for  purposes of the $250,000 test under section 13(a)(2), excise taxes which  (a) are levied at the retail level and (b) are separately stated and  identified in the charge to the customer at the time of sale need not be  included in the calculation of the gross or dollar volume of sales.  Excise taxes which are levied at the manufacturer's, wholesaler's or  other distributive level will not, ordinarily, be excluded in  calculating the volume of sales, nor will excise taxes, even if levied  at the retail level, be excluded in cases where the customer is charged  a single price for the merchandise or services and the taxes are not  separately identified when the sale is made. Excise taxes will be  excludable whether they are levied by the Federal, State, or local  government provided that the tax is ``levied at the retail level'' and  ``separately stated''.</p>
