                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The hearing for the purpose of taking evidence upon a formal  complaint shall be conducted by an administrative law judge.  Administrative law judges shall, so far as practicable, be assigned to  cases in rotation. In case of the death, illness, disqualification or  unavailability of the administrative law judge presiding in any  proceeding, another administrative law judge may be designated to take  his place. Such hearings shall be open to the public unless otherwise  ordered by the administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The administrative law judges shall perform no duties  inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as administrative  law judges. Save to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte  matters as authorized by law, no administrative law judge shall consult  any person or party as to any fact in issue unless upon notice and  opportunity for all parties to participate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative law judges shall act independently in the  performance of their functions as administrative law judge and shall not  be responsible to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, any  officer, employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative  or prosecuting functions for the Department of Labor in the enforcement  of the Public Contracts Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At all hearings it shall be the right of counsel for the  Government to open and close, subject to the right of the administrative  law judge to designate, upon cause shown, who shall open and close.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> It shall be the duty of the administrative law judge to inquire  fully into the facts as to whether the respondent has breached or  violated any of the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act  of June 30, 1936 (49 Stat. 2036, as amended; 41 U.S.C. 35-45), or any  rules or regulations prescribed thereunder, as set forth in the formal  complaint. Counsel for the Government, and the administrative law judge,  shall have the power to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses and  to introduce into the record documentary or other evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any party to the proceeding shall have the right to appear at  such hearing in person, by counsel, or otherwise, to call, examine, and  cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce into the record documentary or  other evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In any such proceedings, the rules of evidence prevailing in  courts of law or equity shall not be controlling. However, it shall be  the policy to exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious  evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In any such proceedings, in the discretion of the administrative  law judge, stipulations of fact may be made with respect to any issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Any objection with respect to the conduct of the hearing,  including any objection to the introduction of evidence, shall be stated  orally, together with a short statement of the grounds for such  objection, and included in the stenographic report of the hearing. No  such objection shall be deemed waived by further participation in the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Unless the administrative law judge otherwise directs, any party  to the proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable period at the close  of the hearing for oral argument, which shall not be included in the  stenographic report of the hearing unless the administrative law judge  directs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In the discretion of the administrative law judge, the hearing  may be   continued from day to day, or adjourned to a later date, or to a  different place, by announcement thereof at the hearing by the  administrative law judge, or by other appropriate notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Contemptuous conduct at any hearing before an administrative law  judge shall be ground for exclusion from the hearing. The failure or  refusal of a witness to appear at any such hearing or to answer any  question which has been ruled to be proper shall be ground for the  action provided in section 5 of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of  June 30, 1936 (sec. 5, 49 Stat. 2039; 41 U.S.C. 39), and in the  discretion of the administrative law judge may be ground for the  striking out of all testimony which may have been previously given by  such witness on related matters.
