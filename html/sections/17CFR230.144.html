                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary Note: Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the registration requirements in the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act or the Securities Act) and the purposes underlying Rule 144:</p><p class="depth0">1. If any person sells a non-exempt security to any other person, the sale must be registered unless an exemption can be found for the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Section 4(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption for a transaction ``by a person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.'' Therefore, an understanding of the term ``underwriter'' is important in determining whether or not the Section 4(1) exemption from registration is available for the sale of the securities.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``underwriter'' is broadly defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition traditionally has focused on the words ``with a view to'' in the phrase ``purchased from an issuer with a view to * * * distribution.'' An investment banking firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly an ``underwriter'' under that section. However, individual investors who are not professionals in the securities business also may be ``underwriters'' if they act as links in a chain of transactions through which securities move from an issuer to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser at the time of an acquisition of securities, prior to and since the adoption of Rule 144, subsequent acts and circumstances have been considered to determine whether the purchaser took the securities ``with a view to distribution'' at the time of the acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on factors such as the length of time

the person held the securities and whether there has been an unforeseeable change in circumstances of the holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon such factors alone has led to uncertainty in the application of the registration provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">The Commission adopted Rule 144 to establish specific criteria for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution. Rule 144 creates a safe harbor from the Section 2(a)(11) definition of ``underwriter.'' A person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, such a person is deemed not to be an underwriter when determining whether a sale is eligible for the Section 4(1) exemption for ``transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.'' If a sale of securities complies with all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144:</p><p class="depth0">1. Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction;</p><p class="depth0">2. Any person who sells restricted or other securities on behalf of an affiliate of the issuer will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction; and</p><p class="depth0">3. The purchaser in such transaction will receive securities that are not restricted securities.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 144 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 still may claim any other available exemption under the Act for the sale of the securities. The Rule 144 safe harbor is not available to any person with respect to any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with Rule 144, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An affiliate of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term person when used with reference to a person for whose account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this section includes, in addition to such person, all of the following persons:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own 10 percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such persons serve as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any corporation or other organization (other than the issuer) in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are the beneficial owners collectively of 10 percent or more of any class of equity securities or 10 percent or more of the equity interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term restricted securities means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Securities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Securities acquired from the issuer that are subject to the resale limitations of Sec. 230.502(d) under Regulation D or Sec. 230.701(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Securities acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions meeting the requirements of Sec. 230.144A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject to the conditions of Regulation CE (Sec. 230.1001);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Equity securities of domestic issuers acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions subject to the conditions of Sec. 230.901 or Sec. 230.903 under Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 230.905, and Preliminary Notes);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Securities acquired in a transaction made under Sec. 230.801 to the same extent and proportion that the securities held by the security holder of the class with respect to which the rights offering was made were, as of the record date for the rights offering, ``restricted securities'' within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Securities acquired in a transaction made under Sec. 230.802 to the same extent and proportion that the securities that were tendered or exchanged in the exchange offer or business combination were ``restricted securities'' within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject to an exemption under section 4(5) (15 U.S.C. 77d(5)) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term debt securities means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any security other than an equity security as defined in Sec. 230.405;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-participatory preferred stock, which is defined as non-convertible capital stock, the holders of which are entitled to a preference in payment of dividends and in distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the issuer, but are not entitled to participate in residual earnings or assets of the issuer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Asset-backed securities, as defined in Sec. 229.1101 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions to be met.

The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to restricted securities sold for the account of a person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale and has not been an affiliate during the preceding three months, provided a period of one year has elapsed since the later of the date the securities were acquired from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), any person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale, and has not been an affiliate during the preceding three months, who sells restricted securities of the issuer for his or her own account shall be deemed not to be an underwriter of those securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Act if all of the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section are met.

(i) If the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, a minimum of six months must elapse between the later of the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in reliance on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any subsequent holder of those securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, a minimum of six months must elapse between the later of the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in reliance on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any subsequent holder of those securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, a minimum of one year must elapse between the later of the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in reliance on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any subsequent holder of those securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the acquiror takes the securities by purchase, the holding period shall not begin until the full purchase price or other consideration is paid or given by the person acquiring the securities from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Promissory notes, other obligations or installment contracts. Giving the issuer or affiliate of the issuer from whom the securities were purchased a promissory note or other obligation to pay the purchase price, or entering into an installment purchase contract with such seller, shall not be deemed full payment of the purchase price unless the promissory note, obligation or contract:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provides for full recourse against the purchaser of the securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is secured by collateral, other than the securities purchased, having a fair market value at least equal to the purchase price of the securities purchased; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Shall have been discharged by payment in full prior to the sale of the securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of holding period. The following provisions shall apply for the purpose of determining the period securities have been held:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock dividends, splits and recapitalizations. Securities acquired from the issuer as a dividend or pursuant to a stock split, reverse split or recapitalization shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities on which the dividend or, if more than one, the initial dividend was paid, the securities involved in the split or reverse split, or the securities surrendered in connection with the recapitalization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conversions and exchanges. If the securities sold were acquired from the issuer solely in exchange for other securities of the same issuer, the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities surrendered for conversion or exchange, even if the securities surrendered were not convertible or exchangeable by their terms.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">If the surrendered securities originally did not provide for cashless conversion or exchange by their terms and the holder provided consideration, other than solely securities of the same issuer, in connection with the amendment of the surrendered securities to permit cashless conversion or exchange, then the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as such amendment to the surrendered securities, so long as, in the conversion or exchange, the securities sold were acquired from the issuer solely in exchange for other securities of the same issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contingent issuance of securities. Securities acquired as a contingent payment of the purchase price of an equity interest in a business, or the assets of a business, sold to the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer shall be deemed to have been acquired at the time of such sale if the issuer or affiliate was then committed to issue the securities subject only to conditions other than the payment of further consideration for such securities. An agreement entered into in connection with any such purchase to remain in the employment of, or not to compete with, the issuer or affiliate or the rendering of services pursuant to such agreement shall not be deemed to be the payment of further consideration for such securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pledged securities. Securities which are bona-fide pledged by an affiliate of the issuer when sold by the pledgee, or by a purchaser, after a default in the obligation secured by the pledge, shall be deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by the pledgor, except that if the securities were pledged without recourse they shall be deemed to have been acquired by the pledgee at the time of the pledge or by the purchaser at the time of purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Gifts of securities. Securities acquired from an affiliate of the issuer by gift shall be deemed to have been acquired by the donee when they were acquired by the donor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Trusts. Where a trust settlor is an affiliate of the issuer, securities acquired from the settlor by the trust, or acquired from the trust by the beneficiaries thereof, shall be deemed to have been acquired when such securities were acquired by the settlor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Estates. Where a deceased person was an affiliate of the issuer, securities held by the estate of such person or acquired from such estate by the estate beneficiaries shall be deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by the deceased person, except that no holding period is required if the estate is not an affiliate of the issuer or if the securities are sold by a beneficiary of the estate who is not such an affiliate.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 230.1449d)(3)(vi)):</p><p class="depth0">While there is no holding period or amount limitation for estates and estate beneficiaries which are not affiliates of the issuer, paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section apply to securities sold by such persons in reliance upon this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Rule 145(a) transactions. The holding period for securities acquired in a transaction specified in Sec. 230.145(a) shall be deemed to commence on the date the securities were acquired by the purchaser in such transaction, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (ix) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Holding company formations. Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction effected solely for the purpose of forming a holding company shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities of the predecessor issuer exchanged in the holding company formation where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The newly formed holding company's securities were issued solely in exchange for the securities of the predecessor company as part of a reorganization of the predecessor company into a holding company structure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Holders received securities of the same class evidencing the same proportional interest in the holding company as they held in the predecessor, and the rights and interests of the holders of such securities are substantially the same as those they possessed as holders of the predecessor company's securities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Immediately following the transaction, the holding company has no significant assets other than securities of the predecessor company and its existing subsidiaries and has substantially the same assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis as the predecessor company had before the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Cashless exercise of options and warrants. If the securities sold were acquired from the issuer solely upon cashless exercise of options or warrants issued by the issuer, the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the exercised options or warrants, even if the options or warrants exercised originally did not provide for cashless exercise by their terms.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1 to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(x):</p><p class="depth0">If the options or warrants originally did not provide for cashless exercise by their terms and the holder provided consideration, other than solely securities of the same issuer, in connection with the amendment of the options or warrants to permit cashless exercise, then the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as such amendment to the options or warrants so long as the exercise itself was cashless.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2 to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(x):</p><p class="depth0">If the options or warrants are not purchased for cash or property and do not create any investment risk to the holder, as in the case of employee stock options, the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the time the options or warrants are exercised, so long as the full purchase price or other consideration for the newly acquired securities has been paid or given by the person acquiring the securities from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer at the time of exercise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on amount of securities sold. Except as hereinafter provided, the amount of securities sold for the account of an affiliate of the issuer in reliance upon this section shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If any securities are sold for the account of an affiliate of the issuer, regardless of whether those securities are restricted, the amount of securities sold, together with all sales of securities of the same class sold for the account of such person within the preceding three months, shall not exceed the greatest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One percent of the shares or other units of the class outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by the issuer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The average weekly reported volume of trading in such securities on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through the automated quotation system of a registered securities association during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice required by paragraph (h), or if no such notice is required the date of receipt of the order to execute the transaction by the broker or the date of execution of the transaction directly with a market maker, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The average weekly volume of trading in such securities reported pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan or an effective national market system plan as those terms are defined in Sec. 242.600 of this chapter during the four-week period specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the securities sold are debt securities, then the amount of debt securities sold for the account of an affiliate of the issuer, regardless of whether those securities are restricted, shall not exceed the greater of the limitation set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or, together with all sales of securities of the same tranche (or class when the securities are non-participatory preferred stock) sold for the account of such person within the preceding three months, ten percent of the principal amount of the tranche (or class when the securities are non-participatory preferred stock) attributable to the securities sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of amount.
