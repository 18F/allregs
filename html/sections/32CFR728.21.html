                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to reservists, as those terms are defined in

Sec. 728.2, ordered to active duty for training or inactive duty training for 30 days or less. Reservists serving under orders specifying duty in excess of 30 days, such as Sea and Air Mariners (SAMS) while on initial active duty for training, will be provided care as members of the Regular service per subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Entitlement. Per 10 U.S.C. 1074a(a), reservists who incur or aggravate an injury, illness, or disease in line of duty while on active duty for training or inactive duty training for a period of 30 days or less, including travel to and from that duty, are entitled to medical and dental care appropriate for the treatment of that injury, disease, or illness until the resulting disability cannot be materially improved by further hospitalization or treatment. Care is authorized for such an injury, illness, or disease beyond the period of training to the same extent as care is authorized for members of the Regular service (see subpart B) subject to the provisions of Sec. 728.21(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Questionable circumstances. If the circumstances are questionable, referral to the OMA or ODA is appropriate. If necessary, make referral to the Naval Medical Command (MEDCOM-33 for medical and MEDCOM-06 for dental) on determinations of entitlements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Line of duty. For the purpose of providing treatment under laws entitling reservists to care, an injury, illness, or disease which is incurred, aggravated, or becomes manifest while a reservist is employed in the performance of active duty for training or inactive duty training (including authorized leave, liberty and travel to and from either duty) will be considered to have been incurred in line of duty (LOD) unless the condition was incurred as a result of the reservist's own misconduct or under other circumstances enumerated in JAG Manual, chapter VIII. While the LOD investigation is being conducted, such reservists remain entitled to care. If the investigation determines that the injury or illness was not incurred in line of duty, the civilian humanitarian nonindigent rate is applicable if further care is required in naval MTFs. (See DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlement Manual for allowable constructive travel times.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Treatment and services authorized. In addition to those services delineated above, the following may be rendered under circumstances outlined:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prosthetic devices, including dental appliances, hearing aids, spectacles, and orthopedic appliances that are lost or have become damaged during training duty, not through negligence of the individual, may be repaired or replaced at Government expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reservists covered by this subpart may be provided the following only if approved by the appropriate OMA or ODA, or by the Commander, Naval Medical Command (MEDCOM-33 for medical and MEDCOM-06 for dental) prior to initiation of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treatment for acute exacerbations of conditions that existed prior to a reservist's period of training duty. Limit care to that necessary for the prevention of pain or undue suffering until the patient can reasonably return to control of the member's private physician or dentist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Remediable physical defects and remediable treatment for other conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Elective surgery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All dental care other than emergency treatment and that necessary to correct an injury incurred in the line of duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Authorization for care. (1) Reservists covered by this subpart may be provided inpatient or outpatient care during a period of training duty without written authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except in emergencies or when inpatient care initiated during a period of training duty extends beyond such period, reservists will be required to furnish written official authorization from their unit commanding officer, or higher authority, incident to receiving inpatient or outpatient care beyond the period of training duty. The letter of authorization will include name, grade or rate, social security number, and organization of the reservist; type of training duty being performed or that was being performed when the condition manifested; diagnosis (if known); and a statement that the condition was incurred in line of duty and that the reservist is entitled to care. If

the reservist has been issued a notice of eligibility (NOE) (subpart I), the NOE may then be accepted in lieu of the letter of authorization. When authorization has not been obtained beforehand, care may be provided on a civilian humanitarian basis (see subpart G) pending final determination of eligibility.</p>
