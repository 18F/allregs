                                Sec. 1024.14  Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 8 violation. Any violation of this section is a  violation of section 8 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No referral fees. No person shall give and no person shall  accept any fee, kickback or other thing of value pursuant to any  agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to  or part of a settlement service involving a federally related mortgage  loan shall be referred to any person. Any referral of a settlement  service is not a compensable service, except as set forth in  Sec. 1024.14(g)(1). A company may not pay any other company or the  employees of any other company for the referral of settlement service  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No split of charges except for actual services performed. No  person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or  percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a  settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a  federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually  performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are  performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee  and violates this section. The source of the payment does not determine  whether or not a service is compensable. Nor may the prohibitions of  this part be avoided by creating an arrangement wherein the purchaser of  services splits the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Thing of value. This term is broadly defined in section 3(2) of  RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(2)). It includes, without limitation, monies,  things, discounts, salaries, commissions, fees, duplicate payments of a  charge, stock, dividends, distributions of partnership profits,  franchise royalties, credits representing monies that may be paid at a  future date, the opportunity to participate in a money-making program,  retained or increased earnings, increased equity in a parent or  subsidiary entity, special bank deposits or accounts, special or unusual  banking terms, services of all types at special or free rates, sales or  rentals at special prices or rates, lease or rental payments based in  whole or in part on the amount of business referred, trips and payment  of another person's expenses, or reduction in credit against an existing  obligation. The term ``payment'' is used throughout Sec. Sec. 1024.14  and 1024.15 as synonymous with the giving or receiving of any ``thing of  value'' and does not require transfer of money.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agreement or understanding. An agreement or understanding for  the referral of business incident to or part of a settlement service  need not be written or verbalized but may be established by a practice,  pattern or course of conduct. When a thing of value is received  repeatedly and is connected in any way with the volume or value of the  business referred, the receipt of the thing of value is evidence that it  is made pursuant to an agreement or understanding for the referral of  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Referral. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A referral includes any oral or written action  directed to a person which has the effect of affirmatively influencing  the selection by any person of a provider of a settlement service or  business incident to or part of a settlement service when such person  will pay for such settlement service or business incident thereto or pay  a charge attributable in whole or in part to such settlement service or  business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A referral also occurs whenever a person paying for a settlement  service or business incident thereto is required to use (see  Sec. 1024.2, ``required use'') a particular provider of a settlement  service or business incident thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fees, salaries, compensation, or other payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 8  of RESPA permits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A payment to an attorney at law for services actually rendered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A payment by a title company to its duly appointed agent for  services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of title  insurance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A payment by a lender to its duly appointed agent or  contractor for services actually performed in the origination,  processing, or funding of a loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A payment to any person of a bona fide salary or compensation  or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for  services actually performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A payment pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral  arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and real estate  brokers. (The statutory exemption restated in this paragraph refers only  to fee divisions within real estate brokerage arrangements when all  parties are acting in a real estate brokerage capacity, and has no  applicability to any fee arrangements between real estate brokers and  mortgage brokers or between mortgage brokers.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Normal promotional and educational activities that are not  conditioned on the referral of business and that do not involve the  defraying of expenses that otherwise would be incurred by persons in a  position to refer settlement services or business incident thereto; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> An employer's payment to its own employees for any referral  activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Bureau may investigate high prices to see if they are the  result of a referral fee or a split of a fee. If the payment of a thing  of value bears no reasonable relationship to the market value of the  goods or services provided, then the excess is not for services or goods  actually performed or provided. These facts may be used as evidence of a  violation of section 8 and may serve as a basis for a RESPA  investigation. High prices standing alone are not proof of a RESPA  violation. The value of a referral (i.e., the value of any additional  business obtained thereby) is not   to be taken into account in determining whether the payment exceeds the  reasonable value of such goods, facilities or services. The fact that  the transfer of the thing of value does not result in an increase in any  charge made by the person giving the thing of value is irrelevant in  determining whether the act is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiple services. When a person in a position to refer  settlement service business, such as an attorney, mortgage lender, real  estate broker or agent, or developer or builder, receives a payment for  providing additional settlement services as part of a real estate  transaction, such payment must be for services that are actual,  necessary and distinct from the primary services provided by such  person. For example, for an attorney of the buyer or seller to receive  compensation as a title agent, the attorney must perform core title  agent services (for which liability arises) separate from attorney  services, including the evaluation of the title search to determine the  insurability of the title, the clearance of underwriting objections, the  actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the title  insurance company, and, where customary, issuance of the title  commitment, and the conducting of the title search and closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recordkeeping. Any documents provided pursuant to this section  shall be retained for five (5) years from the date of execution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Appendix B of this part. Illustrations in appendix B of this  part demonstrate some of the requirements of this section.</p>
