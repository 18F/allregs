                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An implantable pacemaker pulse generator is a device that has a power supply and electronic circuits that produce a periodic electrical pulse to stimulate the heart. This device is used as a substitute for the heart's intrinsic pacing system to correct both intermittent and continuous cardiac rhythm disorders. This device may include triggered, inhibited, and asynchronous modes and is implanted in the human body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date PMA or notice of completion of PDP is required. A PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before September 20, 2012, for any implantable pacemaker pulse generator device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before September 20, 2012, been found to be substantially equivalent to any implantable pacemaker pulse generator device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other implantable pacemaker pulse generator device shall have an approved PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
