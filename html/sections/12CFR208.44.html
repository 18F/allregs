Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized member bank (as defined in Sec. 208.43(b)(3)) shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this subpart applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable until such time as the Board approves a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted by the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to submit capital restoration plan.

The guarantee and limit of liability under section 38 and this subpart shall expire after the Board notifies the bank that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters.
