Service upon such counsel or representative shall constitute service upon the party, but a copy also shall be transmitted to the party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are serving a document under paragraph (a) of this section, then you must use one of the following methods of service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certified mail;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First-class mail;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commercial delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In-person delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Facsimile (``fax'') service, but only for the types of documents listed in Sec. 2429.24(g) and only where fax equipment is available; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Electronic mail (``email''), but only when the receiving party has agreed to be served by email.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you serve a document under this section, then you must file, with the appropriate FLRA office, a statement indicating that the party has served that document (a ``statement of service'').

Regardless of how you file a statement of service with the FLRA, you must ensure that your statement of service includes the names of the parties and persons that you served, their addresses, the date on which you served them, the nature of the document(s) that you served, and the manner in which you served the parties or persons that you served. You must also sign and date the statement of service, unless you are using the FLRA's eFiling system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of service.
