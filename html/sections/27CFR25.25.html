A brewer desiring to operate a tavern as an alternate use of brewery premises, shall submit a Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10 containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the operation of the tavern on brewery premises will not jeopardize the revenue or impede the effective administration of this part and is not contrary to specific provisions of law, the approval of the Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10 shall constitute approval of the alternate use of brewery premises, in lieu of the application required by Sec. 25.23. As used in this section, ``tavern'' means a portion of brewery premises where beer is sold to consumers. Food, and/or taxpaid wine, and/or taxpaid distilled spirits may also be sold at a tavern operated on brewery premises. Taxpaid beer produced by other brewers may be received, stored and sold on brewery premises in accordance with Sec. 25.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Brewer's Notice. In preparing the Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10, the applicant shall show the following information, in addition to the information required by the form:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant shall identify the portion of the brewery which will be operated as a tavern by providing a diagram or narrative description of the boundaries of the tavern. The diagram or description shall identify areas of the brewery which are accessible to the public and areas which are not. The applicant shall describe security measures to be used to segregate public areas from non-public areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant shall describe in detail the method to be used for measuring beer for the purposes of tax determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant shall identify the tanks which will periodically contain tax-determined beer, and any other areas where tax-determined beer will be stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures. The following procedures shall apply to operation of a tavern on brewery premises:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The brewery shall have a suitable method for measurement of the beer, such as a meter or gauge glass. Tax determination shall consist of the measurement of the beer and the preparation of the brewer's record of tax determination, required by Sec. 25.292(a)(8). The taxes shall be determined prior to the time that the beer is dispensed into a container for consumption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the brewer uses one or more tanks for tax determination, the following procedures shall apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each such tank shall be durably marked with the words ``tax-determination tank'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxes shall be determined each time beer is added to a tax-determination tank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The brewer may never simultaneously pump into and out of a tax-determination tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A brewer qualified under this section may store, on brewery premises, tax-determined beer which is intended for sale at a tavern operated on brewery premises, in accordance with this section. The prohibition of Sec. 25.24 shall not apply to such tax-determined beer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Beer consumed by employees and visitors in the brewery's tavern shall be beer on which the tax has been paid or determined.
