For purposes of this subpart only, an installment payment under 47 CFR 1.2110(g) will not be considered deliquent until the expiration of all applicable grace periods and any other applicable periods under Commission rules to make the payment due. The rules set forth in this subpart in no way affect the Commission's rules, as may be amended, regarding payment for licenses (including installment, down, or final payments) or automatic cancellation of Commission licenses (see 47 CFR 1.1902(f)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The term disposable pay means that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld.
