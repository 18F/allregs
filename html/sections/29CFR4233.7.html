Include  as an exhibit annual cash flow projections for the plan without  partition (or suspension, if applicable) through the projected date of  insolvency. Annual cash flow projections must reflect the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Market value of assets as of the beginning of the year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributions and withdrawal liability payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benefit payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Market value of assets at year end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A long-term projection reflecting reduced benefit disbursements  at the PBGC-guarantee level after insolvency, and a statement of the  present value of all future financial assistance without a partition  (using the interest and mortality assumptions applicable to the  valuation of plans terminated by mass withdrawal as specified in  Sec. 4281.13 of this chapter and other reasonable actuarial assumptions,  including retirement age, form of benefit payment, and administrative  expenses, certified by an enrolled actuary).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A detailed statement of the basis for the conclusion that the  original plan will remain solvent if the application for partition, and,  if applicable, the application for suspension of benefits, is granted,  including supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and a description  of the methodology, which must be consistent with section  305(e)(9)(D)(iv) and the regulations thereunder (including any  adjustment to the cash flows in the initial year to incorporate recent  actual fund activity required to be included under that section). Annual  cash flow projections for the original plan with partition (and  suspension, if applicable) must be included as an exhibit and must  reflect the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Market value of assets as of the beginning of the year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributions and withdrawal liability payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benefit payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Market value of assets at year end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If applicable, a copy of the plan actuary's certification under  section 305(e)(9)(C)(i) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The plan's projected insolvency date with benefit suspension  alone (if applicable), including supporting data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A long-term projection reflecting benefit disbursements from the  successor plan, and a statement of the present value of all future  financial assistance to be paid as a result of a partition (using the  interest and mortality assumptions applicable to the valuation of plans  terminated by mass withdrawal as specified in Sec. 4281.13 of this  chapter and other reasonable actuarial assumptions, including retirement  age, form of benefit payment, and administrative expenses, certified by  an enrolled actuary).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional projections.

All  calculations required by this part must be performed by an enrolled  actuary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assumptions. All calculations required by this part must be  consistent with calculations used for purposes of an application for  suspension of benefits under section 305(e)(9) of ERISA, and based on  methods and assumptions each of which is reasonable (taking into account  the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and which, in  combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience  under the plan. Any change(s) in assumptions from the most recent  actuarial valuation, and critical and declining status certification,  must be disclosed and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the  reason(s) for any change(s) in assumptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Updates.
