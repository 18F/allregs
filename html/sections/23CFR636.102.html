The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise noted, the pronoun ``you'' means the primary recipient of Federal-aid highway funds, the State Transportation Department (STD). Where the STD has an agreement with a local public agency (or other governmental agency) to administer a Federal-aid design-build project, the term ``you'' will also apply to that contracting agency.</p>
