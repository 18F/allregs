seal, or metallic shoe seal. A continuous seal may be constructed of fastened segments so as to form a continuous seal.</p><p class="depth0">Cover means a device that provides a continuous barrier over the hazardous secondary material managed in a unit to prevent or reduce air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. A cover may have openings (such as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the unit on which the cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment which can be detached and removed from the unit or a cover may be formed by structural features permanently integrated into the design of the unit.</p><p class="depth0">Empty hazardous secondary material container means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A container from which all hazardous secondary materials have been removed that can be removed using the practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container, e.g., pouring, pumping, and aspirating, and no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remain on the bottom of the container or inner liner;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A container that is less than or equal to 119 gallons in size and no more than 3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the container remains in the container or inner liner; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> A container that is greater than 119 gallons in size and no more than 0.3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the container remains in the container or inner liner.</p><p class="depth0">Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a tank or container, captures organic vapors emitted from the tank or container, and vents the captured vapors through a closed-vent system to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">External floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that rests on the surface of the material managed in a tank with no fixed roof.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a unit in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the material managed in the unit.</p><p class="depth0">Floating membrane cover means a cover consisting of a synthetic flexible membrane material that rests upon and is supported by the hazardous secondary material being managed in a surface impoundment.</p><p class="depth0">Floating roof means a cover consisting of a double deck, pontoon single deck, or internal floating cover which rests upon and is supported by the material being contained, and is equipped with a continuous seal.</p><p class="depth0">Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed in accordance with relevant standards and good engineering practices.</p><p class="depth0">In light material service means the container is used to manage a material for which both of the following conditions apply: The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic constituents in the material is greater than 0.3 kilopascals (kPa) at 20 C; and the total concentration of the pure organic constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the material surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside a tank that has a fixed roof.</p><p class="depth0">Liquid-mounted seal means a foam or liquid-filled primary seal mounted in contact with the hazardous secondary material between the tank wall and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the tank.</p><p class="depth0">Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">Material determination means performing all applicable procedures in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 261.1084 of this subpart to determine whether a hazardous secondary material meets standards specified in this subpart. Examples of a material determination include performing the procedures in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 261.1084 of this subpart to determine the average VO concentration of a hazardous secondary material at

the point of material origination; the average VO concentration of a hazardous secondary material at the point of material treatment and comparing the results to the exit concentration limit specified for the process used to treat the hazardous secondary material; the organic reduction efficiency and the organic biodegradation efficiency for a biological process used to treat a hazardous secondary material and comparing the results to the applicable standards; or the maximum volatile organic vapor pressure for a hazardous secondary material in a tank and comparing the results to the applicable standards.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum organic vapor pressure means the sum of the individual organic constituent partial pressures exerted by the material contained in a tank, at the maximum vapor pressure-causing conditions (i.e., temperature, agitation, pH effects of combining materials, etc.) reasonably expected to occur in the tank. For the purpose of this subpart, maximum organic vapor pressure is determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 261.1084(c) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Metallic shoe seal means a continuous seal that is constructed of metal sheets which are held vertically against the wall of the tank by springs, weighted levers, or other mechanisms and is connected to the floating roof by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.</p><p class="depth0">No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in Sec. 261.1084(d) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Point of material origination means as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> When the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material is the generator of the hazardous secondary material, the point of material origination means the point where a material produced by a system, process, or material management unit is determined to be a hazardous secondary material excluded under Sec. 261.4(a)(27).</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (1) of the definition of Point of material origination: In this case, this term is being used in a manner similar to the use of the term ``point of generation'' in air standards established under authority of the Clean Air Act in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> When the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material is not the generator of the hazardous secondary material, point of material origination means the point where the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material accepts delivery or takes possession of the hazardous secondary material.</p><p class="depth2">Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth2">Single-seal system means a floating roof having one continuous seal. This seal may be vapor-mounted, liquid-mounted, or a metallic shoe seal.</p><p class="depth2">Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that is mounted such that

there is a vapor space between the hazardous secondary material in the unit and the bottom of the seal.</p><p class="depth2">Volatile organic concentration or VO concentration means the fraction by weight of the volatile organic compounds contained in a hazardous secondary material expressed in terms of parts per million (ppmw) as determined by direct measurement or by knowledge of the material in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 261.1084 of this subpart. For the purpose of determining the VO concentration of a hazardous secondary material, organic compounds with a Henry's law constant value of at least 0.1 mole-fraction-in-the-gas-phase/mole-fraction-in the liquid-phase (0.1 Y/X) (which can also be expressed as 1.8 x 10-\6\atmospheres/gram-mole/m\3\) at 25 degrees Celsius must be included.</p>
