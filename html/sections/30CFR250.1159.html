An MPR or MER will be based on well tests and any limitations imposed by well and surface equipment, sand production, reservoir sensitivity, gas-oil and water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent operating practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Regional Supervisor sets an MPR for a producing well completion and/or an MER for a reservoir, you may not exceed those rates except due to normal variations and fluctuations in production rates as set by the Regional Supervisor.</p><p class="depth2">Flaring, Venting, and Burning Hydrocarbons</p>
