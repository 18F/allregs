                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Handling of checks when a guardian or other fiduciary has been  appointed. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A guardian appointed in accordance with applicable State  law, or a fiduciary appointed in accordance with other applicable law,  may indorse checks issued for the following classes of payments the  right to which under law does not terminate with the death of the payee:  payments for the redemption of currencies or for principal and/or  interest on U.S. securities; payments for tax refunds; and payments for  goods and services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A guardian or other fiduciary indorsing any such check on behalf  of an incompetent payee, must include, as part of the indorsement, an  indication of the capacity in which the guardian or fiduciary is  indorsing. An example would be: ``John Jones by Mary Jones, guardian of  John Jones.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a check indorsed in this fashion is presented for payment  by a financial institution, it will be paid by Treasury without  submission of documentary proof of the authority of the guardian or  other fiduciary, with the understanding that evidence of such claimed  authority to indorse may be required by Treasury in the event of a  dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A guardian or other fiduciary may not indorse a check issued for  any class of payment other than one specified in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section. When a check other than one specified in paragraph (a)(1)  of this section is received by a guardian or other fiduciary, the check  must be returned to the certifying agency with information as to the  incompetence of the payee and documentary evidence showing the  appointment of the guardian or other fiduciary in order that a  replacement check, and future checks, may be drawn in favor of the  guardian or other fiduciary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Handling of checks when a guardian or other fiduciary has not  been appointed. If a guardian or other fiduciary has not been appointed,  all checks issued to an incompetent payee must be returned to   the certifying agency for determination as to whether, under applicable  law, payment is due and to whom it may be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Handling of certain checks by an attorney-in-fact.  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if a check was issued  for a class of payments the right to which under law terminates upon the  death of the beneficiary, such as a recurring benefit payment or  annuity, the check may be negotiated under a durable special power of  attorney or springing durable special power of attorney subject to the  restrictions enumerated in Sec. 240.17. After the end of the six-month  period provided in Sec. Sec. 240.17(d) and (e), such checks must be  handled in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
