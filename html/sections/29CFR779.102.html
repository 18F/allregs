                            <p class="depth0">The Act has applied since 1938 and continues to apply to all  employees, not specifically exempted, who are engaged: (a) In interstate  or foreign commerce or (b) in the production of goods for such commerce,  which is defined to include any closely related process or occupation  directly essential to such production. (See Sec. Sec. 779.12-779.16 for  definitions governing the scope of this coverage.) Prior to the 1961  amendments a retailer was not generally concerned with the coverage  provisions as they applied to his individual employees because retail or  service establishments ordinarily were exempt. However, in some cases  such coverage was applicable as where employees were employed in central  offices of warehouses of retail chain store systems and, therefore, were  not exempt. (See Sec. 779.118.) Some exemptions for retail or service  establishments were narrowed as a result of the 1961 amendments and  further revised or eliminated by the 1966 amendments effective February  1, 1967. Therefore, discussion of the individual coverage provisions of  the Act is pertinent and this subpart will discuss briefly the  principles of such coverage with particular reference to employment in  the retail or service trades. A more comprehensive discussion with  respect to employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods  for commerce may be found in part 776 of this chapter, the general  coverage bulletin.
