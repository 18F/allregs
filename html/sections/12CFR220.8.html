In a cash account, a creditor, may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Buy for or sell to any customer any security or other asset if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are sufficient funds in the account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor accepts in good faith the customer's agreement  that the customer will promptly make full cash payment for the security  or asset before selling it and does not contemplate selling it prior to  making such payment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Buy from or sell for any customer any security or other asset  if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The security is held in the account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor accepts in good faith the customer's statement  that the security is owned by the customer or the customer's principal,  and that it will be promptly deposited in the account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Issue, endorse, or guarantee, or sell an option for any customer  as part of a covered option transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use an escrow agreement in lieu of the cash, cash equivalents or  underlying asset position if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a short call or a short put, the creditor is  advised by the customer that the required securities, assets or cash are  held by a person authorized to issue an escrow agreement and the  creditor independently verifies that the appropriate escrow agreement  will be delivered by the person promptly; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a call issued, endorsed, guaranteed, or sold on  the same day the underlying asset is purchased in the account and the  underlying asset is to be delivered to a person authorized to issue an  escrow agreement, the creditor verifies that the appropriate escrow  agreement will be delivered by the person promptly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time periods for payment; cancellation or liquidation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Full  cash payment. A creditor shall obtain full cash payment for customer  purchases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within one payment period of the date:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any nonexempted security was purchased;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any when-issued security was made available by the issuer for  delivery to purchasers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any ``when distributed'' security was distributed under a  published plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A security owned by the customer has matured or has been  redeemed and a new refunding security of the same issuer has been  purchased by the customer, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The customer purchased the new security no more than 35 calendar  days prior to the date of maturity or redemption of the old security;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The customer is entitled to the proceeds of the redemption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The delayed payment does not exceed 103 percent of the proceeds  of the old security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of the purchase of a foreign security, within one  payment period of the trade date or within one day after the date on  which settlement is required to occur by the rules of the foreign  securities market, provided this period does not exceed the maximum time  permitted by this part for delivery against payment transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Delivery against payment. If a creditor purchases for or sells  to a customer a security in a delivery against payment transaction, the  creditor shall have up to 35 calendar days to obtain payment if delivery  of the security is delayed due to the mechanics of the transaction and  is not related to the customer's willingness or ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Shipment of securities, extension. If any shipment of securities  is incidental to consummation of a transaction, a creditor may extend  the payment period by the number of days required for shipment, but not  by more than one additional payment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cancellation; liquidation; minimum amount. A creditor shall  promptly cancel or otherwise liquidate a transaction or any part of a  transaction for which the customer has not made full cash payment within  the required time.

Cancellation of the  transaction other than to correct an error shall constitute a sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The 90 day freeze shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within the period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  full payment is received or any check or draft in payment has cleared  and the proceeds from the sale are not withdrawn prior to such payment  or check clearance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The purchased security was delivered to another broker or  dealer for deposit in a cash account which holds sufficient funds to pay  for the security. The creditor may rely on a written statement accepted  in good faith from the other broker or dealer that sufficient funds are  held in the other cash account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extension of time periods; transfers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless the creditor's  examining authority believes that the creditor is not acting in good  faith or that the creditor has not sufficiently determined that  exceptional circumstances warrant such action, it may upon application  by the creditor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Extend any period specified in paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authorize transfer to another account of any transaction  involving the purchase of a margin or exempted security; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Grant a waiver from the 90 day freeze.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applications shall be filed and acted upon prior to the end of  the payment period, or in the case of the purchase of a foreign security  within the period specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, or  the expiration of any subsequent extension.
