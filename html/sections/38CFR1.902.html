                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards in Sec. Sec.  1.900 through 1.953 relating to compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity do not apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim. Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) has the authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection activity on such claims. The standards in Sec. Sec.  1.900 through 1.953 relating to the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent authorized by DOJ in a particular case. Upon identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, VA shall promptly refer the case to DOJ. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to VA for further handling in accordance with the standards in Sec. Sec.  1.900 through 1.953.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sections 1.900 through 1.953 do not apply to tax debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sections 1.900 through 1.953 do not apply to claims between Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal agencies should attempt to resolve interagency claims by negotiation in accordance with Executive Order 12146 (3 CFR, 1980 Comp., pp. 409-412).
