Nothing in  these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement  officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate  appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When any report required by the ERA or any audit or  investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is  reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any  order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to  occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent  of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be  issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may  commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable  Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order,  a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for  Immediate Compliance.
