                                Sec. 779.367  Commercial stationers may qualify as exempt 13(a)(2)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of the Act if it  meets all the requirements of that exemption. Where the establishment  meets these requirements all employees employed by the establishment  will be exempt, except any employees who are engaged in the making or  processing of goods, such as printing and engraving. The commercial  stationer ordinarily has a store on the street level located in the  shopping section of the community where other stores are located and  many people pass by. He has store clerks who sell over the counter to  the consuming public and may have outside salesmen who sell to offices.  He makes very few, if any, sales to other dealers for resale. He keeps  in stock and displays the various items sold over the counter and by  outside salesmen. The number of items in stock typically ranges from  5,000 to 15,000. Primarily, items sold are stationery, pens, pencils,  blotters, briefcases, calendars, clocks, greeting cards, thumbtacks,  typewriter ribbons, carbon paper, paper clips, ink, commercial envelopes  and typewriter paper, filing supplies and similar items. In addition he  may also sell filing cabinets, office desks and chairs, other items of  office furniture and supplies and equipment generally, as well as  standard and portable typewriters and certain other small office  machines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining whether, under the 13(a)(2) exemption, 75 percent  of the establishment's sales are recognized as retail sales, in the case  of commercial stationery establishments which in general operate as  described in Sec. 779.367(a), the sales made which are of  ``Retailable'' items and are not for resale will be recognized as retail  if they meet the requirements for such classification as previously  explained in this subpart. The following position is adopted for  enforcement purposes: All sales other than for resale of stationery,  office supplies and equipment, office furniture and office machinery  commonly stocked by commercial stationers for sale to individual  consumers as well as businesses, including typewriters, adding machines,  small duplicating machines, checkwriters, and the like, will be  considered to be retail except for the sales set out below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales made on a competitive bid basis. This term covers sales  made pursuant to an invitation to bid, particularly sales to Federal,  State, and local governments; sales made in a like manner to commercial  and industrial concerns and institutions are also included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales made pursuant to a requirements contract or other  contractual arrangement involving the sale of a large quantity of goods  over a period of time with a substantially lower price structure for the  individual deliveries than would prevail for the usual sales of the  quantities delivered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales made at quantity discount of 30 percent or more from the  price of the ordinary unit of sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sales of school supplies to municipalities, boards of education,  or schools in the same manner as the sales of school supply  distributors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sales of job printing and engraving other than (i) sales of  social printing and engraving and (ii) sales of printing and engraving  of business envelopes, letterheads, and calling cards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sales of specialized machinery and equipment.</p>
