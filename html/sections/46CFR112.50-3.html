                            <p class="depth0">A hydraulic starting system must meet the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The hydraulic starting system must be a self-contained system  that provides the cranking torque and engine starting RPM recommended by  the engine manufacturer. The hydraulic starting system must be capable  of six consecutive starts, unless a second, separate source of starting  energy capable of three consecutive starts is provided. A second,  separate source of starting energy may provide three of the required six  starts. If a second source is provided, the hydraulic system need only  provide three consecutive starts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The stored hydraulic pressure must be automatically maintained  within the predetermined pressure limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The means of automatically maintaining the hydraulic system  within the predetermined pressure limits must be electrically energized  from the final emergency bus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There must be a means to manually recharge the hydraulic system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Charging of the hydraulic starting system must not cause  insufficient hydraulic pressure for engine starting.
