Unless  otherwise provided in the Schedule, bids may be submitted for quantities  less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an  award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the  unit prices offered, unless the bidder specifies otherwise in the bid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A written award or acceptance of a bid mailed or otherwise  furnished to the successful bidder within the time for acceptance  specified in the bid shall result in a binding contract without further  action by either party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Government may reject a bid as nonresponsive if the prices  bid are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. A bid  is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less  than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in  relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that  the bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even  though it may be the low evaluated bid, or if it is so unbalanced as to  be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 1746, Jan. 11, 1985;  50 FR 52429, Dec. 23, 1985; 55 FR 25531, June 21, 1990; 68 FR 43857,  July 24, 2003]    52.214-11  [Reserved]</p>
