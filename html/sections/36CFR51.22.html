                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Before awarding a concession contract with anticipated annual gross  receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or of more   than 10 years in duration, the Director must submit the concession  contract to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of  Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the  Senate. The Director must not award any such concession contract until  60 days after the submission. Award of these contracts may not be made  without the Director's written approval. The Director may not delegate  this approval except to a Deputy Director or an Associate Director. The  Director may award a concession contract that is not subject to these or  other special award requirements at any time after selection of the best  proposal and execution of the concession contract by the offeror.
