                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the powers specifically described in this part,  the Appeals Board may request the submission of any information or the  appearance of any person it considers necessary to resolve a matter  before it and to enter any order it considers necessary for or  appropriate to the disposition of any matter before it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Appeals Board may refer certain appeals to another PBGC  department or to Appeals Board staff to provide a response to the  appellant. The response from another PBGC department or Board staff  shall be in writing and address the matters raised in the appeal. The  response may be in the form of an explanation or corrected benefit  determination. In either case, the appellant will have 45 calendar-days  from the date of the response to file a written request for review by  the Appeals Board. If a written request for review is not filed with the  Appeals Board within the 45-calendar-day period the determination shall  become effective pursuant to Sec. 4003.22(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appeals that may be referred to another PBGC department or to  the Board staff include those that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Request an explanation of the initial determination being  appealed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dispute specific data used in the determination, such as date  of hire, date of retirement, date of termination of employment, length  of service, compensation, marital status and form of benefit elected; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Request an explanation of the limits on benefits payable by  PBGC under Part 4022, Subpart B, such as the maximum guaranteeable  benefit and phase-in of the PBGC guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explanation or corrected benefit determination issued under  this subsection is not considered a decision of the Appeals Board. If an  appellant aggrieved by PBGC's initial determination is issued an  explanation or corrected benefit determination under this section, the  appellant has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies until the  appellant has filed a timely request with the Appeals Board for review  and the Appeals Board has issued a decision granting or denying the  relief requested. See Sec. 4003.7 of this part.  [61 FR 34012, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 38120, July 3, 2008]</p>
