Unless the following values result in unrealistic loads, the rolling accelerations may be obtained by modifying the symmetrical flight conditions in Sec. 23.333(d) as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the acrobatic category, in conditions A and F, assume that 100 percent of the semispan wing airload acts on one side of the plane of symmetry and 60 percent of this load acts on the other side.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For normal, utility, and commuter categories, in Condition A, assume that 100 percent of the semispan wing airload acts on one side of the airplane and 75 percent of this load acts on the other side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The loads resulting from the aileron deflections and speeds specified in Sec. 23.455, in combination with an airplane load factor of at least two thirds of the positive maneuvering load factor used for design. Unless the following values result in unrealistic loads, the effect of aileron displacement on wing torsion may be accounted for by adding the following increment to the basic airfoil moment coefficient over the aileron portion of the span in the critical condition determined in Sec. 23.333(d):
[Delta]cm=-0.01[delta]
where--
[Delta]cm is the moment coefficient increment; and[delta] is the down aileron deflection in degrees in the critical</p><p class="depth2">condition.
