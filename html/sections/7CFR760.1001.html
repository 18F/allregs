The start and end  dates for each eligible disaster period are specified at http:// disaster.fsa.usda.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible counties are those primary counties declared by the  Secretary or designated for the applicable loss by the President,  including counties contiguous to those counties, between January 1,  2005, and February 28, 2007 (that is after January 1, 2005 and before  February 28, 2007). The listing is provided at http:// disaster.fsa.usda.gov. For counties where there was an otherwise timely  Presidential declaration, but the declarations do not cover agricultural  physical loss, the subject counties may still be eligible if the  counties were the subject of an approved Administrator's Physical Loss  Notice (APLN) when the APLN applies to a natural disaster timely  designated by the President.</p>
