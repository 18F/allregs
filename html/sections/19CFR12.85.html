For certain products manufactured before an applicable standard or  regulation was in effect, a declaration will be filed in accordance with  the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. The declaration will  state that the product was manufactured before the applicable standard  or regulation was in effect.

When the importer  or consignee of a product declares that it will be brought into  conformity before being sold or offered for sale, or before being used  on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and on the  high seas beyond the territorial seas for a vessel owned in the United  States and seeks entry of the product under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section, the entry shall be accepted only if bond is given for the  production of a statement by either the importer or the consignee that  the product described in the declaration is in conformity with  applicable safety standards or regulations.
