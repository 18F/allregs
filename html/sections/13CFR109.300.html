                            <p class="depth0">An ILP Intermediary must maintain compliance with all ILP Program  Requirements until the ILP Intermediary has repaid its ILP Loan to SBA.  With respect to its activities in the ILP program, the ILP Intermediary  is subject to the requirements of Secs. 120.140 (What ethical  requirements apply to participants?), 120.197 (Notifying SBA's Office of  Inspector General of suspected fraud), 120.412 (Other services Lenders  may provide Borrowers), and 120.413 (Advertisement of relationship with  SBA) of this chapter, in addition to the regulations specifically set  forth in this Part. The ILP Intermediary and any contractor(s) it may  have are independent contractors that are responsible for their own  actions with respect to small business loans made under this program.  SBA has no responsibility or liability for any claim by an Eligible  Small Business Concern or other party for any injury as a result of any  wrongful action taken by the ILP Intermediary or an employee, agent or  contractor of an ILP Intermediary.</p>
