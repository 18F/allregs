                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Undue or improper influence. No cable operator that has an  attributable interest in a satellite cable programming vendor or in a  satellite broadcast programming vendor shall unduly or improperly  influence the decision of such vendor to sell, or unduly or improperly  influence such vendor's prices, terms and conditions for the sale of,  satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any  unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discrimination in prices, terms or conditions. No satellite  cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable  interest, or satellite broadcast programming vendor, shall discriminate  in the prices, terms, and conditions of sale or delivery of satellite  cable programming or satellite broadcast programming among or between  competing cable systems, competing cable operators, or any competing  multichannel video programming distributors. Nothing in this subsection,  however, shall preclude:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The imposition of reasonable requirements for creditworthiness,  offering of service, and financial stability and standards regarding  character and technical quality;</p><p class="depth3">Note 1: Vendors are permitted to create a distinct class or classes  of service in pricing based on credit considerations or financial  stability, although any such distinctions must be applied for reasons  for other than a multichannel video programming distributor's  technology. Vendors are not permitted to manifest factors such as  creditworthiness or financial stability in price differentials if such  factors are already taken into account through different terms or  conditions such as special credit requirements or payment guarantees.</p><p class="depth3">Note 2: Vendors may establish price differentials based on factors  related to offering of service, or difference related to the actual  service exchanged between the vendor and the distributor, as manifested  in standardly applied contract terms based on a distributor's particular  characteristics or willingness to provide secondary services that are  reflected as a discount or surcharge in the programming service's price.  Such factors include, but are not limited to, penetration of programming  to subscribers or to particular systems; retail price of programming to  the consumer for pay services; amount and type of promotional or  advertising services by a distributor; a distributor's purchase of  programming in a package or a la carte; channel position; importance of  location for non-volume reasons; prepayment discounts; contract  duration; date of purchase, especially purchase of service at launch;  meeting competition at the distributor level; and other legitimate  factors as standardly applied in a technology neutral fashion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The establishment of different prices, terms, and conditions to  take into account actual and reasonable differences in the cost of  creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of satellite cable  programming, satellite broadcast programming, or terrestrial cable  programming;</p><p class="depth3">Note: Vendors may base price differentials, in whole or in part, on  differences in the cost of delivering a programming service to  particular distributors, such as differences in costs, or additional  costs, incurred for advertising expenses, copyright fees, customer  service, and signal security. Vendors may base price differentials on  cost differences that occur within a given technology as well as between  technologies. A price differential for a program service may not be  based on a distributor's retail costs in delivering service to  subscribers unless the program vendor can demonstrate that subscribers  do not or will not benefit from the distributor's cost savings that  result from a lower programming price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The establishment of different prices, terms, and conditions  which take into account economies of scale,   cost savings, or other direct and legitimate economic benefits  reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers served by the  distributor; or</p><p class="depth3">Note: Vendors may use volume-related justifications to establish  price differentials to the extent that such justifications are made  available to similarly situated distributors on a technology-neutral  basis. When relying upon standardized volume-related factors that are  made available to all multichannel video programming distributors using  all technologies, the vendor may be required to demonstrate that such  volume discounts are reasonably related to direct and legitimate  economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers  served by the distributor if questions arise about the application of  that discount. In such demonstrations, vendors will not be required to  provide a strict cost justification for the structure of such standard  volume-related factors, but may also identify non-cost economic benefits  related to increased viewership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exclusive contracts and practices--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unserved areas. No cable  operator shall engage in any practice or activity or enter into any  understanding or arrangement, including exclusive contracts, with a  satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast programming  vendor for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast  programming that prevents a multichannel video programming distributor  from obtaining such programming from any satellite cable programming  vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, or any  satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an  attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by  a cable operator as of October 5, 1992.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specific arrangements: Subdistribution agreements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unserved  areas. No cable operator shall enter into any subdistribution agreement  or arrangement for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast  programming with a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable  operator has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast  programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable  interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by a cable  operator as of October 5, 1992 unless such agreement or arrangement  complies with the limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limitations on subdistribution agreements in unserved areas. No  cable operator engaged in subdistribution of satellite cable programming  or satellite broadcast programming may require a competing multichannel  video programming distributor to</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Purchase additional or unrelated programming as a condition of  such subdistribution; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide access to private property in exchange for access to  programming. In addition, a subdistributor may not charge a competing  multichannel video programming distributor more for said programming  than the satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast  programming vendor itself would be permitted to charge. Any cable  operator acting as a subdistributor of satellite cable programming or  satellite broadcast programming must respond to a request for access to  such programming by a competing multichannel video programming  distributor within fifteen (15) days of the request. If the request is  denied, the competing multichannel video programming distributor must be  permitted to negotiate directly with the satellite cable programming  vendor or satellite broadcast programming vendor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public interest determination. In determining whether an  exclusive contract is in the public interest for purposes of paragraph  (c)(5) of this section, the Commission will consider each of the  following factors with respect to the effect of such contract on the  distribution of video programming in areas that are served by a cable  operator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effect of such exclusive contract on the development of  competition in local and national multichannel video programming  distribution markets;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of such exclusive contract on competition from  multichannel video programming distribution technologies other than  cable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The effect of such exclusive contract on the attraction of  capital investment in the production and distribution of new satellite  cable programming;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The effect of such exclusive contract on diversity of  programming in the multichannel video programming distribution market;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The duration of the exclusive contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Commission approval required. Any cable operator, satellite  cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable  interest, or satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable  operator has an attributable interest must submit a ``Petition for  Exclusivity'' to the Commission and receive approval from the Commission  to preclude the filing of complaints alleging that an exclusive contract  with respect to areas served by a cable operator violates section  628(c)(2)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The petition for exclusivity shall contain those portions of the  contract relevant to exclusivity, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A description of the programming service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The extent and duration of exclusivity proposed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any other terms or provisions directly related to exclusivity or  to any of the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.  The petition for exclusivity shall also include a statement setting  forth the petitioner's reasons to support a finding that the contract is  in the public interest, addressing each of the five factors set forth in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any competing multichannel video programming distributor  affected by the proposed exclusivity may file an opposition to the  petition for exclusivity within thirty (30) days of the date on which  the petition is placed on public notice, setting forth its reasons to  support a finding that the contract is not in the public interest under  the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Any such  formal opposition must be served on petitioner on the same day on which  it is filed with the Commission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The petitioner may file a response within ten (10) days of  receipt of any formal opposition. The Commission will then approve or  deny the petition for exclusivity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Geographic limitations. Nothing in this section  shall require any person who is engaged in the national or regional  distribution of video programming to make such programming available in  any geographic area beyond which such programming has been authorized or  licensed for distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability to satellite retransmissions. Nothing in this  section shall apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the signal of any broadcast affiliate of a national  television network or other television signal that is retransmitted by  satellite but that is not satellite broadcast programming; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To any internal satellite communication of any broadcast  network or cable network that is not satellite broadcast programming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemptions for prior contracts--(1) In general. Nothing in this  section shall affect any contract that grants exclusive distribution  rights to any person with respect to satellite cable programming and  that was entered into or before June 1, 1990, except that the provisions  of paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section shall apply for distribution to  persons in areas not served by a cable operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on renewals. A contract that was entered into on or  before June 1, 1990, but that was renewed or extended after October 5,  1992, shall not be exempt under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application to existing contracts. All contracts, except those  specified in paragraph (e) of this section, related to the provision of  satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any  multichannel video programming distributor must be brought into  compliance with the requirements specified in this subpart no later than  November 15, 1993.
