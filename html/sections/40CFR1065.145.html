                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Continuous and batch sampling. Determine the total mass of each  constituent with continuous or batch sampling. Both types of sampling  systems have probes, transfer lines, and other sampling system  components that are described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> for a given test. For  purposes of this part 1065, the test engine includes all the devices  related to converting the chemical energy in the fuel to the engine's  mechanical output energy. This may or may not involve vehicle- or  equipment-based devices. For example, all of an engine's cylinders are  considered to be part of the test engine even if the exhaust is divided  into separate exhaust stacks. As another example, all the cylinders of a  diesel-electric locomotive are considered to be part of the test engine  even if they transmit power through separate output shafts, such as  might occur with multiple engine-generator sets working in tandem. Use  one of the following procedures to measure emissions with multiple  exhaust stacks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Route the exhaust flow from the multiple stacks into a single  flow as described in Sec.  1065.130(c)(6). Sample and measure emissions  after the exhaust streams are mixed. Calculate the emissions as a single  sample from the entire engine. We recommend this as the preferred  option, since it requires only a single measurement and calculation of  the exhaust molar flow for the entire engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> requires measuring or  calculating the exhaust molar flow for each stack separately. If the  exhaust molar flow in each stack cannot be calculated from combustion  air flow(s), fuel flow(s), and measured gaseous emissions, and it is  impractical to measure the exhaust molar flows directly, you may  alternatively proportion the engine's calculated total exhaust molar  flow rate (where the flow is calculated using combustion air mass  flow(s), fuel mass flow(s), and emissions concentrations) based on  exhaust molar flow measurements in each stack using a less accurate,  non-traceable method. For example, you may use a total pressure probe  and static pressure measurement in each stack.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> requires measuring or  calculating the exhaust molar flow for each stack separately. You may  alternatively proportion the engine's calculated total exhaust molar  flow rate based on calculation and measurement limitations as described  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Use the average of the engine's  total power or work values from the multiple test runs to calculate  brake-specific emissions. Divide the total mass (or mass rate) of each  emission by the average power (or work). You may alternatively use the  engine power or work associated with the corresponding stack during each  test run if these values can be determined for each stack separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> requires only  a single exhaust flow measurement or calculation for the entire engine.  You may determine which stack has the highest concentration by  performing multiple test runs, reviewing the results of earlier tests,  or using good engineering judgment. Note that the highest concentration  of different pollutants may occur in different stacks. Note also that  the stack with the highest concentration of a pollutant during a test  interval for field testing may be a different stack than the one you  identified based on average concentrations over a duty cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must use an accurate, traceable measurement or calculation  of the engine's total exhaust molar flow rate for calculating the mass  of emissions from the entire engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may dry the single, combined, proportional sample stream;  you may not dry the sample streams from each stack separately.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must measure and proportion the sample flows from each  stack with active flow controls. For PM sampling, you must measure and  proportion the diluted sample flows from each stack with active flow  controls that use only smooth walls with no sudden change in cross- sectional area. For example, you may control the dilute exhaust PM  sample flows using electrically conductive vinyl tubing and a control  device that pinches the tube over a long enough transition length so no  flow separation occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For PM sampling, the transfer lines from each stack must be  joined so the angle of the joining flows is 12.5[deg] or less. Note that  the exhaust manifold must meet the same specifications as the transfer  line according to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em>:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must measure and demonstrate that the sample flow from each  stack is within 5% of the value from the stack with the highest sample  flow. You may alternatively ensure that the stacks have equal flow rates  without measuring sample flows by designing a passive sampling system  that meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The probes and transfer line branches must be symmetrical, have  equal lengths and diameters, have the same number of bends, and have no  filters.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If probes are designed such that they are sensitive to stack  velocity, the stack velocity must be similar at each probe. For example,  a static pressure probe used for gaseous sampling is not sensitive to  stack velocity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The stack static pressure must be the same at each probe. You  can meet this requirement by placing probes at the end of stacks that  are vented to atmosphere.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For PM sampling, the transfer lines from each stack must be  joined so the angle of the joining flows is 12.5[deg] or less. Note that  the exhaust manifold must meet the same specifications as the transfer  line according to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may use the procedure in this paragraph (b)(6) only if you  perform an analysis showing that the resulting error due to imbalanced  stack flows and concentrations is either at or below 2%. You may  alternatively show that the resulting error does not impact your ability  to demonstrate compliance with applicable standards. For example, you  may use less accurate, non-traceable measurements of emission  concentrations and molar flow in each stack and demonstrate that the  imbalances in flows and concentrations cause 2% or less error.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a two-stack engine, you may use the procedure in this  paragraph (b)(6) only if you can show that the stack with the higher  flow has the lower average concentration for each pollutant over the  duty cycle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You must use an accurate, traceable measurement or calculation  of the engine's total exhaust molar flow rate for calculating the mass  of emissions from the entire engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You may dry the single, equally combined, sample stream; you may  not dry the sample streams from each stack separately.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You may determine your exhaust flow rates with a chemical  balance of exhaust gas concentrations and either intake air flow or fuel  flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gaseous and PM sample probes. A probe is the first fitting in a  sampling system. It protrudes into a raw or diluted exhaust stream to  extract a sample, such that its inside and outside surfaces are in  contact with the exhaust. A sample is transported out of a probe into a  transfer line, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The  following provisions apply to sample probes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Probe design and construction. Use sample probes with inside  surfaces of 300 series stainless steel or, for raw exhaust sampling, use  any nonreactive material capable of withstanding raw exhaust  temperatures. Locate sample probes where constituents are mixed to their  mean sample concentration. Take into account the mixing of any crankcase  emissions that may be routed into the raw exhaust. Locate each probe to  minimize interference with the flow to other probes. We recommend that  all probes remain free from influences of boundary layers, wakes, and  eddies--especially near the outlet of a raw-exhaust stack where  unintended dilution might occur. Make sure that purging or back-flushing  of a probe does not influence another probe during testing. You may use  a single probe to extract a sample of more than one constituent as long  as the probe meets all the specifications for each constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gaseous sample probes. Use either single-port or multi-port  probes for sampling gaseous emissions. You may orient these probes in  any direction relative to the raw or diluted exhaust flow. For some  probes, you must control sample temperatures, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For probes that extract NOX from diluted exhaust,  control the probe's wall temperature to prevent aqueous condensation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For probes that extract hydrocarbons for THC or NMHC analysis  from the diluted exhaust of compression-ignition engines, two-stroke  spark-ignition engines, or four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or  below 19 kW, we recommend heating the probe to minimize hydrocarbon  contamination consistent with good engineering judgment. If you  routinely fail the contamination check in the 1065.520 pretest check, we  recommend heating the probe section to approximately 190 [deg]C to  minimize contamination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> PM sample probes. Use PM probes with a single opening at the  end. Orient PM probes to face directly upstream. If you shield a PM  probe's opening with a PM pre-classifier such as a hat, you may not use  the preclassifier we specify in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. We  recommend sizing the inside diameter of PM probes to approximate  isokinetic sampling at the expected mean flow rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. This may involve measuring temperature  at various locations within transfer lines and fittings. You may use a  single transfer line to transport a sample of more than one constituent,  as long as the transfer line meets all the specifications for each  constituent. The following construction and temperature tolerances apply  to transfer lines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gaseous samples. Use transfer lines with inside surfaces of 300  series stainless steel, PTFE, Viton\TM\, or any other material that you  demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling. For raw exhaust  sampling, use a non-reactive material capable of withstanding raw  exhaust temperatures. You may use in-line filters if they do not react  with exhaust constituents and if the filter and its housing meet the  same temperature requirements as the transfer lines, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For NOX transfer lines upstream of either an  NO2-to-NO converter that   meets the specifications of Sec.  1065.378 or a chiller that meets the  specifications of Sec.  1065.376, maintain a sample temperature that  prevents aqueous condensation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For THC transfer lines for testing compression-ignition  engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, or four-stroke spark- ignition engines at or below 19 kW, maintain a wall temperature  tolerance throughout the entire line of (191 11)  [deg]C. If you sample from raw exhaust, you may connect an unheated,  insulated transfer line directly to a probe. Design the length and  insulation of the transfer line to cool the highest expected raw exhaust  temperature to no lower than 191 [deg]C, as measured at the transfer  line's outlet. For dilute sampling, you may use a transition zone  between the probe and transfer line of up to 92 cm to allow your wall  temperature to transition to (191 11) [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> PM samples. We recommend heated transfer lines or a heated  enclosure to minimize temperature differences between transfer lines and  exhaust constituents. Use transfer lines that are inert with respect to  PM and are electrically conductive on the inside surfaces. We recommend  using PM transfer lines made of 300 series stainless steel. Electrically  ground the inside surface of PM transfer lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Optional sample-conditioning components for gaseous sampling.  You may use the following sample-conditioning components to prepare  gaseous samples for analysis, as long as you do not install or use them  in a way that adversely affects your ability to show that your engines  comply with all applicable gaseous emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NO2-to-NO converter. You may use an NO2-to-NO  converter that meets the converter conversion verification specified in  Sec.  1065.378 at any point upstream of a NOX analyzer,  sample bag, or other storage medium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> to decrease the effects of water on gaseous  emission measurements. You may not use a chemical dryer, or use dryers  upstream of PM sample filters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Osmotic-membrane. You may use an osmotic-membrane dryer upstream  of any gaseous analyzer or storage medium, as long as it meets the  temperature specifications in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Because  osmotic-membrane dryers may deteriorate after prolonged exposure to  certain exhaust constituents, consult with the membrane manufacturer  regarding your application before incorporating an osmotic-membrane  dryer. Monitor the dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure,  ptotal, downstream of an osmotic-membrane dryer. You may use  continuously recorded values of Tdew and ptotal in  the amount of water calculations specified in Sec.  1065.645. For our  testing we may use average temperature and pressure values over the test  interval or a nominal pressure value that we estimate as the dryer's  average pressure expected during testing as constant values in the  amount of water calculations specified in Sec.  1065.645. For your  testing, you may use the maximum temperature or minimum pressure values  observed during a test interval or duty cycle or the high alarm  temperature setpoint or low alarm pressure setpoint as constant values  in the calculations specified in Sec.  1065.645. For your testing, you  may also use a nominal ptotal, which you may estimate as the  dryer's lowest absolute pressure expected during testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>. For our testing we may  use average temperature and pressure values over the test interval or a  nominal pressure value that we estimate as the dryer's average pressure  expected during testing as constant values in the calculations specified  in Sec.  1065.645. For your testing you may use the maximum temperature  and minimum pressure values observed during a test interval or duty  cycle or the high alarm temperature setpoint and the low alarm pressure  setpoint as constant values in the amount of water calculations  specified in Sec.  1065.645. For your testing you may also use a nominal  ptotal, which you may estimate as the dryer's lowest absolute  pressure expected during testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sample pumps. You may use sample pumps upstream of an analyzer  or storage medium for any gas. Use sample pumps with inside surfaces of  300 series stainless steel, PTFE, or any other material that you  demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling. For some sample  pumps, you must control temperatures, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you use a NOX sample pump upstream of either an  NO2-to-NO converter that meets Sec.  1065.378 or a chiller  that meets Sec.  1065.376, it must be heated to prevent aqueous  condensation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For testing compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark- ignition engines, or four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19  kW, if you use a THC sample pump upstream of a THC analyzer or storage  medium, its inner surfaces must be heated to a tolerance of (191 11) [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ammonia Scrubber. You may use ammonia scrubbers for any or all  gaseous sampling systems to prevent interference with NH3,  poisoning of the NO2-to-NO converter, and deposits in the  sampling system or analyzers. Follow the ammonia scrubber manufacturer's  recommendations or use good engineering judgment in applying ammonia  scrubbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Optional sample-conditioning components for PM sampling. You may  use the following sample-conditioning components to prepare PM samples  for analysis, as long as you do not install or use them in a way that  adversely affects your ability to show that your engines comply with the  applicable PM emission standards. You may condition PM samples to  minimize positive and negative biases to PM results, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PM preclassifier. You may use a PM preclassifier to remove  large-diameter particles. The PM preclassifier may be either an inertial  impactor or a cyclonic separator. It must be constructed of 300 series  stainless steel. The preclassifier must be rated to remove at least 50%  of PM at an aerodynamic diameter of 10 [micro]m and no more than 1% of  PM at an aerodynamic diameter of 1 [micro]m over the range of flow rates  for which you use it. Follow the preclassifier manufacturer's  instructions for any periodic servicing that may be necessary to prevent  a buildup of PM. Install the preclassifier in the dilution system  downstream of the last dilution stage. Configure the preclassifier  outlet with a means of bypassing any PM sample media so the  preclassifier flow may be stabilized before starting a test. Locate PM  sample media within 75 cm downstream of the preclassifier's exit. You  may not use this preclassifier if you use a PM probe that already has a  preclassifier. For example, if you use a hat-shaped preclassifier that  is located immediately upstream of the probe in such a way that it  forces the sample flow to change direction before entering the probe,  you may not use any other preclassifier in your PM sampling system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other components. You may request to use other PM conditioning  components upstream of a PM preclassifier, such as components that  condition humidity or remove gaseous-phase hydrocarbons from the diluted  exhaust stream. You may use such   components only if we approve them under Sec.  1065.10.  [75 FR 23030, Apr. 30, 2010; 79 FR 23756, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
