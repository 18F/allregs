in, the design heat input capacity of  the unit, a description of the add-on controls used on the unit to  comply with this subpart, description of the fuel(s) burned, including  whether the fuel(s) were a secondary material determined by you or the  EPA through a petition process to be a non-waste under Sec. 241.3 of  this chapter, whether the fuel(s) were a secondary material processed  from discarded non-hazardous secondary materials within the meaning of  Sec. 241.3 of this chapter, and justification for the selection of  fuel(s) burned during the compliance demonstration.</p><p
