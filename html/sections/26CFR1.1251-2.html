With respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, any taxpayer who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has a farm net loss (as defined in section 1251(e)(2) and in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1251-3) for such a taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has an excess deductions account balance as of the close of such a taxable year
shall establish (if not previously established) and maintain for purposes of

section 1251 an excess deductions account. See section 1251(b)(1). Once an excess deductions account is established (or succeeded to under paragraph (e) of this section in the case of certain corporate transactions and gifts) all entries (including the entries prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section with respect to married taxpayers who file joint returns) with respect to the account must be part of the taxpayer's permanent records for all taxable years for which the account must be maintained. For purposes of applying section 1251 and this section, the term taxpayer in the case of a partnership means each partner of such partnership and in the case of an estate or trust means the estate or trust regardless of whether it is taxable under subpart A or E, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions from estate or trust. If farm recapture property is distributed from an estate or trust in a transaction to which section 1251(d) (1) or (2) (relating to exceptions for gifts and transfers at death) applies, then the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust shall be succeeded to by the distributee in the amount, if any, and manner prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence only, the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be applied by treating each distribution as a gift at the time made. Thus; for example, if all of the farm recapture property of an estate or trust is distributed to a distributee on the date the estate or trust terminates, the distributee will succeed on that date to the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception. A taxpayer is not required to maintain an excess deductions account under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for a taxable year if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For such taxable year there would be no additions to the taxpayer's excess deductions account, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the immediately preceding taxable year the balance in the taxpayer's excess deductions account was reduced to zero by reason of section 1251 (b)(3) (relating to subtractions from the account) or section 1251(b)(5) (relating to transfer of account).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additions to account--(1) General rule. For each taxable year, there shall be added to the excess deductions account an amount equal to the taxpayer's farm net loss. See section 1251(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For each taxable year, there shall be added to the excess deductions account an amount equal to the taxpayer's farm net loss. See section 1251(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. In the case of an individual and, in the case of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply for a taxable year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only if the taxpayer's nonfarm adjusted gross income (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1251-3) for such year exceeds $50,000, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Only to the extent the taxpayer's farm net loss for such year exceeds $25,000.
The limitations of this subparagraph apply to a person (other than a trust) to whom the tax rates set forth in section 1 are applicable and as prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph in respect of an electing small business corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Electing small business corporation--(i) Taxable years ending before December 11, 1971.

For purposes of determining whether a shareholder of such corporation has a farm net loss, there shall not be taken into account his pro rata share of farm

net income or loss of any other electing small business corporation for such corporation's taxable year ending with or within his taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of this subdivision (i) do not apply for purposes of determining whether the shareholder must make an addition to his excess deductions account and the amount of such addition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable years ending after December 10, 1971.

The lower limitations in the preceding sentence shall not apply if the spouse of the taxpayer does not have any nonfarm adjusted gross income for the taxable year. See section 1251(b)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Joint return. If married taxpayers for a taxable year file a joint return under section 6013, then for purposes of this paragraph they shall for such taxable year be treated as a single taxpayer. For rules applicable to establishing, maintaining, and allocating a joint excess deductions account, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For 1971, the M Corporation which uses the claendar year as its taxable year and which is not an electing small business corporation has a farm net loss of $40,000 and nonfarm taxable income of $45,000. Since subparagraph (2) of this paragraph does not apply to M, it is required to make a $40,000 addition to its excess deductions account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For 1971, A, an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, has a farm net loss of $33,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $65,000. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, A is required to make an addition of $8,000 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of the farm net loss, $33,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph). If, however, A were a trust, the limitation in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph would not apply and such trust would be required to add $33,000 (the amount of the entire farm net loss) to its excess deductions account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. H and W each use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1971, H, a married taxpayer who files a separate return, has a farm net loss of $45,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $60,000. H's spouse W does not have any nonfarm adjusted gross income for 1971. Thus, the lower limitations in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph do not apply. Accordingly, H is required to make an addition of $20,000 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of the farm net loss, $45,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that for 1971 W has a farm net loss of $10,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $30,000. Thus, the lower limitations in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph do apply and H is required to make an addition of $32,500 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of his farm net loss, $45,000, over the $12,500 amount referred to in subparagraph (4)(i)(b) of this paragraph). Since, however, W did not have a farm net loss in excess of $12,500, she would not be required to make an addition to her excess deductions account. For the result if H and W were to file a joint return, see example (1) of paragraph (f)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. For 1970, the M Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which is an electing small business corporation, has a farm net loss of $35,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $60,000. A, B, and C, the sole equal shareholders of M, are cash method taxpayers and each uses a fiscal year ending on March 31. For the taxable year ending March 31, 1971, A has a farm net loss of $5,000. Thus, as M's taxable year ends within the taxable year of A during which A has a farm net loss, the limitations in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph do not apply with respect to M for 1970. See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, to add $35,000 to its excess deductions account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example (5), except that A's farm net loss occurred in his fiscal year ending March 31, 1970, and no shareholder of M has a farm net loss for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1971. Thus, the limitations in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph do apply with respect to M for 1970, and accordingly M is required to add $10,000 to its excess deductions account for 1970 (that is, the excess of M's farm net loss $35,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in example (6), except that M has $45,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income for 1970 and A, for his taxable year ending March 31, 1971, has $40,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income,

computed without regard to his interest in M. Assume the M paid no dividends. Since, under paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-3, A's income from M under section 1373(b) is computed on the basis of M's nonfarm adjusted gross income, A's gross income from M is $15,000 (\1/3\ of $45,000), and A's total nonfarm adjusted gross income is $55,000. Accordingly, M would be required to add $10,000 to its excess deductions account for 1970 for the reasons stated in example (6).</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in example (7). Assume further that A is one of two equal shareholders in N, another electing small business corporation with a taxable year ending on January 31, and that N for its taxable year ending on January 31, 1971, has a $42,000 nonfarm loss and farm net income of $23,000. Assume that N paid no dividends. Thus, A for purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, would only have a total of $34,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($55,000) computed per example (7) minus $21,000 (A's share of N's nonfarm net operating loss (\1/2\ of $42,000) computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-3)). Assuming that no other shareholder of M has nonfarm adjusted gross income in excess of $50,000, by reason of the $50,000 limitation in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, M makes no addition for 1971 to its excess deductions account. (N would make no addition to its excess deductions account as it does not have a farm net loss.) If, however, N were to have a nonfarm loss of only $8,000, A for purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph would have a total of $51,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($51,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($55,000, minus \1/2\ of N's nonfarm loss of $8,000)). Hence, with respect to M the result would be the same as in example (7) (and N would make no addition to its excess deductions account since it does not have a farm net loss).</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. D and E are equal individual shareholders in corporations X, Y, and Z, the stock of each corporation having recently been purchased from a different unrelated person. X, Y, and Z are electing small business corporations. D, E, and the corporations all use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1970, the farm net income of D and E (determined without regard to their respective pro rata shares of the farm net income or loss of X, Y, and Z) are $100,000 and zero, respectively. For 1970, the farm net income or loss of the corporations are losses of $80,000 and $20,000 for X and Z, respectively, and income of $60,000 for Y. For 1970, the determinations under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph as to whether a shareholder of corporation X or Z (no determination is necessary with respect to Y since Y does not have a farm net loss) has a farm net loss are made as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Determinations as to whether D or E has a farm net loss----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">As to X                   As to Z</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">D            E            D            E----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Farm net income (determined without regard to X, Y, and Z)..     $100,000           $0     $100,000           $0Pro rata (\1/2\) share of corporation's farm net income (or</p><p class="depth0">loss):</p><p class="depth0">Of X......................................................  ...........  ...........

Accordingly, since the determination as to X indicates that neither D nor E has a farm net loss, the limitations of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph apply to X. Thus, assuming that X, D, or E has nonfarm adjusted gross income in excess of $50,000, X will add $55,000 to its excess deductions account, i.e., the excess of the farm net loss, $80,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph. Since, however, the determination as to Z indicates that E has a farm net loss, such limitations do not apply to Z. Thus, the addition for 1970 to Z's excess deductions account is the entire amount of its farm net loss, $20,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subtractions from account--(1) General rule. Under section 1251(b)(3), if there is any amount in the excess deductions account at the close of a taxable year (determined after making any addition required under paragraph (b) of this section for such year but before making any reduction under this paragraph for such year), then the excess deductions account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by subtracting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Under section 1251(b)(3), if there is any amount in the excess deductions account at the close of a taxable year (determined after making any addition required under paragraph (b) of this section for such year but before making any reduction under this paragraph for such year), then the excess deductions account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by subtracting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount equal to (a) the farm net income (as defined in section 1251 (e)(3) and in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1251-3) for such year, plus (b) the amount (as determined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) necessary to adjust the account for deductions for any taxable

year which did not result in a reduction of the taxpayer's tax under subtitle A of the Code for such taxable year or any preceding taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After making any addition to the excess deductions account under paragraph (b) of this section and any reduction under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for the taxable year, an amount equal to the sum of the amounts recognized as ordinary income solely by reason of the application of section 1251(c)(1). See section 1251(b)(3)(B). Thus, no amount shall be subtracted under this subdivision for gain recognized by reason of the application of section 1245(a)(1) or 1252(a)(1). For effect on computation of farm net loss or income of gain recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property, see paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-3. In the case of an installment sale of farm recapture property, the taxpayer's excess deductions account shall be reduced under this subdivision in the year of such sale by an amount equal to the gain (computed in the year of sale) to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.

The amounts to be subtracted are determined under subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph in accordance with the rules in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph. This subtraction shall be made before determining the amount of gain to which section 1251(c) applies. The amount subtracted under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is a temporary subtraction made solely to determine the amount in the excess deductions account for purposes of the limitation in section 1251(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Temporary subtraction. The amount temporarily subtracted from the excess deductions account for a taxable year is the sum of the farm portion of (a) any net operating loss for such taxable year which does not reduce taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) in a prior year, and (b) any net operating loss from a prior taxable year which is carried to such taxable year but which does not reduce taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) in such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permanent subtraction. The amount permanently subtracted from the excess deductions account for a taxable year is the excess of the farm portion of any net operating loss which may be carried to the preceding year (reducing by the portion of such loss which reduced taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) for such preceding year) over the amount of such loss which may be carried to the taxable year, but the subtraction shall not be made earlier than the taxable year in which the excess deductions account is increased by reason of such loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rules of application. For purposes of this subparagraph, the following rules shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The farm portion of a net operating loss is that portion of such loss attributable to the trade or business of farming. Such portion and the remaining portion (hereinafter referred to as the nonfarm loss) shall be absorbed pro rata. If a farm net loss is not added to the excess deductions account in the year in which such loss occurs, the net operating loss (if any) for such year shall be treated as a nonfarm loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an individual (other than a trust), the farm portion of a net operating loss shall be decreased by an amount, if any, equal to the excess of $25,000 (or the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) over the nonfarm adjusted gross income. Such amount shall be added to the nonfarm portion of such net operating loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amounts considered as reducing taxable income under subdivision

(ii) of this subparagraph in the taxable year shall be determined on the basis of a tentative computation of taxable income for such year in which the gain realized from the disposition of property to which section 1251(c)(1) applied shall be computed without regard to the excess deductions account limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: A is an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. For the years 1970 through 1974, A's items of income and deductions are as shown in the table below. A's personal deductions are disregarded. A had no income or loss for any year prior to 1970. Based upon such amounts and the computations shown below, A must recognize as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $35,325 for 1971, $10,000 for 1972, $3,925 for 1973, and $150,000 for 1974.

Expenditures subject to the requirement of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph are all expenditures, whether direct or indirect, paid or incurred, which are properly chargeable to capital account. For examples of the meaning of the term properly chargeable to capital account, see Sec. Sec. 1.61-4, 1.162-12, 1.263(a)-1, and 1.263(a)-2, and paragraph

(a)(4) (ii) and (iii) of Sec. 1.446-1. Other examples of expenditures referred to in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph are expenditures under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation), 180 (relating to fertilizer, etc.), 182 (relating to land clearing), and 266 (relating to certain carrying charges) which (without regard to section 1251) a taxpayer may treat or elect to treat as expenditures which are not chargeable to capital account. Thus, for example, with respect to developing a farm, ranch, orchard, or grove, amounts properly chargeable to capital account include amounts paid or incurred for upkeep, taxes, interest, and other carrying charges, water for irrigation, fertilizing, controlling undergrowth, and the cultivating and spraying of trees. For a further example, with respect to a produced animal, amounts properly chargeable to capital account for the animal include all expenditures paid or incurred for producing the animal, such as for stud, breeding, and veterinary services, as well as all amounts paid or incurred with respect to the brood animal during the gestation period of the produced animal including all amounts paid or incurred for feed, maintenance, utilities, indirect overhead, depreciation, insurance, and carrying charges. Direct and indirect expenditures properly chargeable to capital account with respect to raising an animal may include, in addition to expenditures for feed, maintenance, etc., expenditures for training. Direct and indirect expenditures with respect to feed may include, in the case of a grazing operation, fees for the rental of grazing land, and the portion of all labor, taxes, interest, fencing costs, and carrying charges paid or incurred by the taxpayer allocable to grazing. For purposes of this subparagraph, reasonable allocations shall be made by the taxpayer of items between animals held for different purposes and as to each animal held. However, all amounts allocated to a brood animal during the period of gestation are, for purposes of this subparagraph, entirely chargeable to the capital of the produced animal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested crops. With respect to unharvested crops to which section 1231(b)(4) applies, see section 268 and paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1016-5 (relating, respectively, to disallowance of certain deductions and to adjustments to basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Changes in character of property. If, in a taxable year subsequent to the first taxable year to which an election under section 1251(b)(4) applies, property which was not subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph becomes subject to such requirements, then the following rules shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The adjusted basis of such property at the beginning of the taxable year in which it becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall be equal to the amount its adjusted basis would have been on such date had it been accounted for in accordance with such requirements (taking into account, if applicable, the depreciation which would have been allowed as determined by the taxpayer using a period, salvage value, and methods that would have been proper).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> At the beginning of the taxable year in which such property becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If such property was not included in the opening inventory, the amount equal to the excess of its adjusted basis as computed in (a) of this subdivision over its adjusted basis as of the close of the preceding taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such property was included in the opening inventory, such opening inventory shall be reduced by the inventory value of such property included therein and the amount of the difference between the adjusted basis for the property computed in (a) of this subdivision and such inventory value,
Shall be added to gross income for such taxable year and shall be treated as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.1251-3, except that if the difference in (b)(2) of this subdivision represents an excess of such inventory value over the adjusted basis for the property computed in (a) of this subdivision then such excess shall be subtracted from gross income for such taxable year and shall be treated as a deduction allowed which is directly connected with carrying on the trade or

business of farming under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of Sec. 1.1251-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If any deductions for depreciation are treated as amounts which would have been allowed in a prior taxable year or years for purposes of (a) of this subdivision, such deduction shall be treated as having been allowed for purposes of applying sections 1245 and 1250 in the same taxable year or years and thus included in the amount of adjustments reflected in adjusted basis within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.1245-2 or depreciation adjustments within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 1.1250-2 (as the case may be).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph (3), if during a taxable year property becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, it shall be considered subject to such requirements on each day it is held during such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The adjusted basis under (a) of this subdivision of property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation shall be its basis for which deductions may be computed under section 167.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The provisions of subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: On January 1, 1974, A, an individual taxpayer who in a previous year had elected under section 1251(b)(4) to compute income from the trade or business of farming by using inventories and by charging to capital account all items properly chargeable to capital under the rules of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, purchases a herd of six-month-old feeder calves for $13,000. During 1974, in connection with such herd, A incurred raising costs of $4,000 and carrying charges of $1,600 which would have been properly chargeable to capital account within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph if the herd had not been included in inventory. A determines under his unit-livestock method that on December 31, 1974, the inventory value of the herd is $17,000. On March 1, 1975, A decides to use one-half of the herd for breeding purposes with such part of the herd becoming subject to the capitalization requirements. On January 1, 1975, the adjusted basis for the animals held for breeding purposes, computed under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph, is $9,300 (that is, the aggregate of one-half of the purchase price of $13,000 for the entire herd of feeder calves, $6,500, one-half of the carrying charges of $1,600 incurred during 1974 in connection with the entire herd, $800, and one-half of the $4,000 of raising costs incurred during 1974 for the entire herd, $2,000). There is no adjustment for the depreciation which would have been allowed since no animal in the herd had reached an acceptable breeding age. Therefore, A as of January 1, 1975, must under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(b)(2) of this subparagraph subtract $8,500 from his opening inventory value of $17,000. However, A has not changed his method of accounting with respect to such animals. Under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(b)(2) of this subparagraph, A for 1975 will add $800 to his gross income (that is, the difference between the adjusted basis for the calves to be used for breeding purposes, $9,300, over the inventory value of such animals, $8,500). Such amount under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(b) shall be treated as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming under paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.1251-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Time and manner of making election--(i) In general. The election under section 1251(b)(4) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be filed within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. Such election shall be made and filed by attaching a statement of such election signed by the taxpayer to the return for the first taxable year for which the election is made. The statement shall contain a declaration that the taxpayer is making an election under section 1251(b)(4) of the Code and that taxable income from the trade or business of farming is computed by using inventories for all property, which may be inventoried and by charging to capital account all expenditures paid or incurred which are properly chargeable to capital account (including such expenditures which the taxpayer may, under chapter 1 of the Code or regulations prescribed thereunder, otherwise treat or elect to treat as expenditures which are not properly chargeable to capital account). Additionally, the statement must contain the information prescribed by subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

For purposes of this paragraph, a joint return does not include a return of a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2 relating to a spouse who died during either of his two taxable years immediate preceding the taxable year) which is treated as a joint return of a husband and wife under section 6013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of excess deductions account limitation in joint return year. In the case of a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, the aggregate of the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (after applying paragraph (b) (2)(o) and (3) of Sec. 1.125-1, if applicable) shall not exceed the amount in the joint excess deductions account (that is, the aggregate of the separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse) at the close of the taxable year after subtracting from each such separately

maintained account the amount specified in section 1251(b) (3) (A) and paragraph (c) (1) (i) of this section as modified by the rules of this paragraph. For the amount of limitation for a taxable year for which a separate return is filed, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

Thus, under paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-2, the potential gain limitation percentage and the proportion for allocating the amount in the joint excess deductions account to one or more donees shall be determined by treating the spouses as a single taxpayer.

Thus, under paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-2, the potential gain limitation percentage and the proportion for allocating the amount in the joint excess deductions account to one or more donees shall be determined by treating the spouses as a single taxpayer.

Assume the same facts as in example (4) of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, except that H and W file a joint return under section 6013 and that H has a farm net loss of only $40,000. Thus, since the nonfarm adjusted gross income for calendar year 1971 was $60,000 for H and $30,000 for W, their combined nonfarm adjusted gross income exceeds $50,000, thereby satisfying under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph the $50,000 limitation of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Assume further that for 1971 only W makes a dispostion of farm recapture property (other than land and section 1245 property). As a result of such disposition, W realizes a gain of $14,000. Accordingly, for 1971, the separately maintained excess deductions accounts of H and W, their joint excess deductions account, and the treatment of the gain realized by W on the disposition of the farm recapture property are computed, in accordance with the facts assumed in the table below:</p><p class="depth0">Excess Deductions Accounts----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Balance Jan. 1, 1971............................  ........   $10,000  ........    $5,000  ........   $15,000(2) Additions for 1971:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Farm net loss for 1971........................   $40,000  ........   $10,000  ........   $50,000  ........</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less amount in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this       20,000  ........     5,000  ........    25,000  ........</p><p class="depth0">section as allocated under subparagraph (1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">of this paragraph................................</p><p class="depth0">----------          ----------          ----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Total additions for 1971......................  ........    20,000  ........     5,000  ........    25,000</p><p class="depth0">----------          ----------          ---------(3) Subtotal........................................  ........    30,000  ........    10,000  ........    40,000(4) Subtractions for 1971...........................  ........         0  ........         0  ........</p><p class="depth0">----------          ----------          ---------(5) Excess deductions account limitation on gain      ........    30,000  ........    10,000  ........    40,000</p><p class="depth0">recognized as ordinary income under section</p><p class="depth0">1251(e)(1) for 1971................................(6) Subtraction for dispositions of farm recapture</p><p class="depth0">property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gain to which section 1251(c)(1) applies               0  ........    14,000  ........    14,000  ........</p><p class="depth0">(computed before applying limitation)............</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation (amount in line (5))...............    30,000  ........    10,000  ........    40,000  ........</p><p class="depth0">==========          ==========          ==========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gain recognized as ordinary income under        ........  ........  ........    14,000  ........    14,000</p><p class="depth0">section 1251(c)(1), computed for joint account</p><p class="depth0">(lower of line 6(a) or line 6(b) subject to</p><p class="depth0">provisions as to separately maintained accounts</p><p class="depth0">of subparagraph (1)(iii).........................</p><p class="depth0">----------          ----------          ---------(7) Balance Dec. 31, 1971...........................  ........    30,000  ........

If for 1972, H and W were to file separate returns, then the separately maintained excess deductions account balances as of January 1, 1972, would be $26,000 and zero respectively. See subparagraph (5)(ii) of this paragraph.
