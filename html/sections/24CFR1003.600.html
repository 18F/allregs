                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any  other eligible organization, to participate in the ICDBG program.  Neither the federal government nor a tribal government nor any other  entity that administers any program or activity under this part shall  discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's  religious character or affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organizations that receive direct HUD funds under the ICDBG  program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as  worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the  programs or services funded under this part. If an organization conducts  such inherently religious activities, the inherently religious  activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the  programs, activities or services supported by direct HUD funds under  this part, and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of  the programs, activities, or services provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A religious organization that participates in the ICDBG program  will retain its independence from federal, state, local, and tribal  governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the  definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided  that it does not engage in any inherently religious activities, such as  worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the  programs or services funded under a program or activity pursuant to this  part. Among other things, religious organizations may use space in their  facilities to provide ICDBG-funded services, without removing religious  art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a  religious organization participating in the ICDBG program retains its  authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious  terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a  religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's  mission statements and other governing documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A religious organization's exemption from the federal  prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set  forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.  2000e-1), is not forfeited when the organization participates in a HUD  program. Some HUD programs, however, contain independent statutory  provisions that impose certain nondiscrimination requirements on all  grantees. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD  program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An organization that receives direct funds under the ICDBG  program shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against  a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of  religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> ICDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition, construction,  or rehabilitation of structures to the extent   that those structures are used for inherently religious activities.  ICDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or  rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures  are used for conducting eligible activities under this part. Where a  structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities,  ICDBG funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the  acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation that are attributable to  eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements  applicable to ICDBG funds in this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other  rooms that an ICDBG-funded religious congregation uses as its principal  place of worship, however, are ineligible for ICDBG-funded improvements.  Disposition of real property after the term of the grant, or any change  in use of the property during the term of the grant, is subject to  governmentwide regulations governing real property disposition (see 24  CFR parts 84 and 85).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a tribal government voluntarily contributes its own funds to  supplement federally funded activities, the tribal government has the  option to segregate the federal funds or commingle them. However, if the  funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled  funds. Further, if a state or local government is required to contribute  matching funds to supplement a federally funded activity, the matching  funds are considered commingled with the federal assistance and  therefore subject to the requirements of this section. Some HUD programs  requirements govern any project or activity assisted under those  programs. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD  program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.  [69 FR 62169, Oct. 22, 2004]</p>
