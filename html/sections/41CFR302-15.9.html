                                Sec.  302-15.9  Must I repay property management expenses my agency paid at Government expense when I am transferred from my current foreign post of duty to an official station in the United States other than the one I left?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">No, you are not required to repay any property management expenses paid by your agency if you elect to sell your former residence in the United States when transferred from your post of duty to an official station in the United States. The authority for your agency to pay for property management services under this part when you are transferred to a foreign post of duty arises from your transfer to the foreign post of duty. It is separate from, and in addition to, the authority to sell your residence at Government expense when you are transferred to an official station in the United States other than the official station from which you were transferred to the foreign post of duty.</p>
