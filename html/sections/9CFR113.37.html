                            <p class="depth0">The test for detection of extraneous pathogens provided in this  section shall be conducted when such a test is prescribed in an  applicable Standard Requirement or in the filed Outline of Production  for the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The biological product to be tested shall be prepared for use as  recommended on the label, or in the case of desiccated vaccine to be  used in poultry, rehydrated with sterile distilled water at the rate of  30 ml per 1,000 doses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One volume of the prepared vaccine shall be mixed with up to  nine volumes of sterile heat-inactivated specific antiserum to  neutralize the vaccine virus in the product. Each lot of antiserum shall  be demonstrated by virus neutralization tests not to inhibit other  viruses known to be possible contaminants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After neutralization, 0.2 ml of the vaccine-serum mixture shall  be inoculated into each of at least 20 fully susceptible chicken  embryos.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Twenty embryos, 9 to 11 days old, shall be inoculated on the  chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) with 0.1 ml, and in the allantoic sac  with 0.1 ml.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eggs shall be candled daily for 7 days. Deaths occurring during  the first 24 hours shall be disregarded but at least 18 viable embryos  shall survive 24 hours post-inoculation for a valid test. Examine all  embryos and CAM's from embryos which die after the first day. When  necessary, embryo subcultures shall be made to determine the cause of a  death. The test shall be concluded on the seventh day post-inoculation  and the surviving embryos (including CAM's) examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If death and/or abnormality attributable to the inoculum occur,  the serial is unsatisfactory: Provided, That, if there is a vaccine  virus override, the test may be repeated, using a higher titered  antiserum.
