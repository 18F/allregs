When special restorative training has been requested or is being considered for an eligible person with a disability who is a child, spouse, or surviving spouse, a counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will obtain all information necessary to determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training.

Following consultation with the panel and receipt of the panel's report, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training. If this determination is affirmative, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will prepare an individualized written plan comparable to a plan

for an extended evaluation under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31. In the case of an eligible person who is a spouse or surviving spouse, or a child who has attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the spouse or surviving spouse, or the child, respectively. In the case of an eligible person who has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the eligible person and his or her parent or guardian (see Sec. 21.3021(d)).

The case of an eligible person shall be referred to the panel for consideration of whether the eligible person may be permitted reentrance into special restorative training following interruption. The panel will recommend approval to the counseling psychologist if there is a reasonable expectation that the purpose of special restorative training will be accomplished. See Sec. 21.3306.
