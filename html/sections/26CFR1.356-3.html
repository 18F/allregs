                                Sec. 1.356-3  Rules for treatment of securities as ``other property''.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a general rule, for purposes of section 356, the term other  property includes securities. However, it does not include securities  permitted under section 354 or section 355 to be received tax free.  Thus, when securities are surrendered in a transaction to which section  354 or section 355 is applicable, the characterization of the securities  received as ``other property'' does not include securities received  where the principal amount of such securities does not exceed the  principal amount of securities surrendered in the transaction. If a  greater principal amount of securities is received in an exchange  described in section 354 (other than subsection (c) or (d) thereof) or  section 355 over the principal amount of securities surrendered, the  term other property includes the fair market value of such excess  principal amount as of the date of the exchange. If no securities are  surrendered in exchange, the term other property includes the fair  market value, as of the date of receipt, of the entire principal amount  of the securities received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> applies to transactions occurring on or  after March 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, stock means common stock  and   warrants means rights to acquire common stock. The following examples  illustrate the rules of paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, an individual, exchanged 100 shares of stock for 100  shares of stock and a security in the principal amount of $1,000 with a  fair market value of $990. The amount of $990 is treated as ``other  property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. B, an individual, exchanged 100 shares of stock and a  security in the principal amount of $1,000 for 300 shares of stock and a  security in the principal amount of $1,500. The security had a fair  market value on the date of receipt of $1,575. The fair market value of  the excess principal amount, or $525, is treated as ``other property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. C, an individual, exchanged a security in the principal  amount of $1,000 for 100 shares of stock and a security in the principal  amount of $900. No part of the security received is treated as ``other  property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. D, an individual, exchanged a security in the principal  amount of $1,000 for 100 shares of stock and a security in the principal  amount of $1,200 with a fair market value of $1,100. The fair market  value of the excess principal amount, or $183.33, is treated as ``other  property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. E, an individual, exchanged a security in the principal  amount of $1,000 for another security in the principal amount of $1,200  with a fair market value of $1,080. The fair market value of the excess  principal amount, or $180, is treated as ``other property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. F, an individual, exchanged a security in the principal  amount of $1,000 for two different securities each in the principal  amount of $750. One of the securities had a fair market value of $750,  the other had a fair market value of $600. One-third of the fair market  value of each security ($250 and $200) is treated as ``other property.''</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. G, an individual, exchanged stock for stock and a  warrant. The warrant had no principal amount. Thus, G received no excess  principal amount within the meaning of section 356(d).</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. H, an individual, exchanged a warrant for stock and a  warrant. The warrants had no principal amount. Thus, H received no  excess principal amount within the meaning of section 356(d).</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. I, an individual, exchanged a warrant for stock and a  debt security. The warrant had no principal amount. The debt security  had a $100 principal amount. I received $100 of excess principal amount  within the meaning of section 356(d).
