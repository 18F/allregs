                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Terms in this section shall have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aggregation point. A point at which network monitoring data for a 911 service area is collected and routed to a network operations center (NOC) or other location for monitoring and analyzing network status and performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification. An attestation by a certifying official, under penalty of perjury, that a covered 911 service provider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has satisfied the obligations of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has adequate internal controls to bring material information regarding network architecture, operations, and maintenance to the certifying official's attention.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has made the certifying official aware of all material information reasonably necessary to complete the certification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The term ``certification'' shall include both an annual reliability certification under paragraph (c) of this section and an initial reliability certification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to the extent provided under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certifying official. A corporate officer of a covered 911 service provider with supervisory and budgetary authority over network operations in all relevant service areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Covered 911 service provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any entity that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provides 911, E911, or NG911 capabilities such as call routing, automatic location information (ALI), automatic number identification (ANI), or the functional equivalent of those capabilities, directly to a public safety answering point (PSAP), statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority as defined in Secs. 64.3000(b) and 20.3 of this chapter; and/or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Operates one or more central offices that directly serve a PSAP. For purposes of this section, a central office directly serves a PSAP if it hosts a selective router or ALI/ANI database, provides equivalent NG911 capabilities, or is the last service-provider facility through which a 911 trunk or administrative line passes before connecting to a PSAP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``covered 911 service provider'' shall not include any entity that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Constitutes a PSAP or governmental authority to the extent that it provides 911 capabilities; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Offers the capability to originate 911 calls where another service provider delivers those calls and associated number or location information to the appropriate PSAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Critical 911 circuits. 911 facilities that originate at a selective router or its functional equivalent and terminate in the central office that serves the PSAP(s) to which the selective router or its functional equivalent delivers 911 calls, including all equipment in the serving central office necessary for the delivery of 911 calls to the PSAP(s). Critical 911 circuits also include ALI and ANI facilities that originate at the ALI or ANI database and terminate in the central office that serves the PSAP(s) to which the ALI or ANI databases deliver 911 caller information, including all equipment in the serving central office necessary for the delivery of such information to the PSAP(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Diversity audit. A periodic analysis of the geographic routing of network components to determine whether they are physically diverse. Diversity audits may be performed through manual or automated means, or through a review of paper or electronic records, as long as they reflect whether critical 911 circuits are physically diverse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Monitoring links. Facilities that collect and transmit network monitoring data to a NOC or other location for monitoring and analyzing network status and performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Physically diverse. Circuits or equivalent data paths are Physically Diverse if they provide more than one physical route between end points with no common points where a single failure at that point would cause both circuits to fail. Circuits that share a common segment such as a fiber-optic cable or circuit board are not Physically diverse even if they are logically diverse for purposes of transmitting data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> 911 service area. The metropolitan area or geographic region in which a covered 911 service provider operates a

selective router or the functional equivalent to route 911 calls to the geographically appropriate PSAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Selective router. A 911 network component that selects the appropriate destination PSAP for each 911 call based on the location of the caller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Tagging. An inventory management process whereby critical 911 circuits are labeled in circuit inventory databases to make it less likely that circuit rearrangements will compromise diversity. A covered 911 service provider may use any system it wishes to tag circuits so long as it tracks whether critical 911 circuits are physically diverse and identifies changes that would compromise such diversity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provision of reliable 911 service. All covered 911 service providers shall take reasonable measures to provide reliable 911 service with respect to circuit diversity, central-office backup power, and diverse network monitoring. Performance of the elements of the certification set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), and (c)(3)(i) of this section shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. If a covered 911 service provider cannot certify that it has performed a given element, the Commission may determine that such provider nevertheless satisfies the requirements of this paragraph based upon a showing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section that it is taking alternative measures with respect to that element that are reasonably sufficient to mitigate the risk of failure, or that one or more certification elements are not applicable to its network.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual reliability certification. One year after the initial reliability certification described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and every year thereafter, a certifying official of every covered 911 service provider shall submit a certification to the Commission as follows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circuit auditing.
