                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tread depth. The tread shall be not less than four thirty- seconds of an inch deep on each front tire of any vehicle other than a  trailer and not less than two thirty-seconds of an inch on all other  tires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. For tires with treadwear indicators, check  for indicators in any two adjacent major grooves at three locations  spaced approximately 120[deg] apart around the circumference of the  tire. For tires without treadwear indicators, measure the tread depth  with a suitable gauge or scale in two adjacent major grooves at 3  locations spaced approximately 120[deg] apart around the circumference  of the tire at the area of greatest wear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type. Vehicles should be equipped with tires on the same axle  that are matched in construction and tire size designation, and dual  tires shall be matched for overall diameter within one-half inch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Examine visually. A mismatch in size and  construction between tires on the same axle, or a major deviation from  the size recommended by the vehicle or tire manufacturer, is a cause for  rejection. On a dual-tire arrangement the diameter of one of the duals  must be within one-half inch of the other as measured by a gauge block  inserted between the tire and a caliper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General condition. Tires shall be free from chunking, bumps,  knots, or bulges evidencing cord, ply or tread separation from the  casing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Examine visually for the conditions  indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Damage. Tire cords or belting materials shall not be exposed,  either to the naked eye or when cuts on the tire are probed.  Reinforcement repairs to the cord body are allowable on tires other than  front-mounted tires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Examine visually for the conditions  indicated, using a blunt instrument if necessary to probe cuts and  abrasions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special purpose tires. Tires marked ``Not For Highway Use'' or  ``Farm Use Only'' or other such restrictions shall not be used on any  motor vehicles operating on public highways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Examine visually for tires labeled with  specific restrictions.</p>
