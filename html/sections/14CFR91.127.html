Each pilot of an aircraft must comply with any traffic patterns established for that airport in part 93 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Communications with control towers. Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft to, from, through, or on an airport having an operational control tower unless two-way radio communications are maintained between that aircraft and the control tower. Communications must be established prior to 4 nautical miles from the airport, up to and including 2,500 feet AGL. However, if the aircraft radio fails in flight, the pilot in command may operate that aircraft and land if weather conditions are at or above basic VFR weather minimums, visual contact with the tower is maintained, and a clearance to land is received. If the aircraft radio

fails while in flight under IFR, the pilot must comply with Sec. 91.185.
