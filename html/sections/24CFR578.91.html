                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination of assistance. The recipient or subrecipient may terminate assistance to a program participant who violates program requirements or conditions of occupancy. Termination under this section does not bar the recipient or subrecipient from providing further assistance at a later date to the same individual or family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due process. In terminating assistance to a program participant, the recipient or subrecipient must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance under the due process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Providing the program participant with a written copy of the program rules and the termination process before the participant begins to receive assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written notice to the program participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A review of the decision, in which the program participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that

person) who made or approved the termination decision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prompt written notice of the final decision to the program participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hard-to-house populations. Recipients and subrecipients that are providing permanent supportive housing for hard-to-house populations of homeless persons must exercise judgment and examine all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations are serious enough to warrant termination so that a program participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases.</p>
