                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What programs are covered by this section? This section applies  to any program for which the Secretary establishes priorities for  selection of applications in a particular fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How does the Secretary establish annual priorities? (1) The  Secretary establishes final annual priorities by publishing the  priorities in a notice in the Federal Register, usually in the  application notice for that program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary publishes proposed annual priorities for public  comment, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The final annual priorities will be implemented only by inviting  applications that meet the priorities (Cross-reference: See 34 CFR  75.105(c)(1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of  priorities already established in the program's regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously  interfere with an orderly, responsible grant award process or would  otherwise be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public  interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to  establish specified priorities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities  specified in the program statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> How does the Secretary implement an annual priority? The  Secretary may choose one or more of the following methods to implement  an annual priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Invitations. The Secretary may simply invite applications that  meet a priority. If the Secetary chooses this method, an application  that meets the priority receives no competitive or absolute preference  over applications that do not meet the priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Competitive preference. The Secretary may give one of the  following kinds of competitive preference to applications that meet a  priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary may award some or all bonus points to an  application depending on the extent to which the application meets the  priority. These points are in addition to any points the applicant earns  under the selection criteria (see Sec. 75.200(b)). The notice states  the maximum number of additional points that the Secretary may award to  an application depending upon how well the application meets the  priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary may select an application that meets a priority  over an application of comparable merit that does not meet the priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Absolute preference. The Secretary may give an absolute  preference to applications that meet a priority. The Secretary  establishes a separate competition for applications that meet the  priority and reserves all or part of a program's funds solely for that  competition. The Secretary may adjust the amount reserved for the  priority after determining the number of high quality applications  received.
