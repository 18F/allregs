If the circumstances are such that making these announcements  would be useless or dangerous to the Officer or to another person, the  Protective Force Officer may dispense with these announcements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the time and place of arrest, the Protective Force Officer  may search the person arrested for weapons and criminal evidence, and  may search the area into which the person arrested might reach to obtain  a weapon to destroy evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the arrest is effected, the person arrested shall be  advised of his constitutional right against self-incrimination  (``Miranda warnings''). If the circumstances are such that immediately  advising the person arrested of   this right would result in imminent danger to the Officer or other  persons, the Protective Force Officer may postpone this requirement. The  person arrested shall be advised of this right as soon as practicable  after the imminent danger has passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As soon as practicable after the arrest is effected, custody of  the person arrested should be transferred to other Federal law  enforcement personnel (e.g., U.S. Marshals or FBI agents) or to local  law enforcement personnel, as appropriate, in order to ensure that the  person is brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ordinarily, the person arrested shall not be questioned or  required to sign written statements unless such questioning is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Necessary to establish the identity of the person arrested and  the purpose for which such person is within or upon the SPR;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Necessary to avert an immediate threat to security or safety  (e.g., to locate a bomb); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized by other Federal law enforcement personnel or local  law enforcement personnel responsible for investigating the alleged  crime.</p>
