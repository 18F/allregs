                            <p class="depth0">When a locomotive is out of use for 30 or more consecutive days or  is out of use when it is due for any test or inspection required by  Sec. 229.23, Sec. 229.25, Sec. 229.27, Sec. 229.29, or Sec. 229.31, an  out-of-use notation showing the number of out-of-use days shall be made  on an inspection line on Form FRA F 6180-49A. A supervisory employee of  the carrier who is responsible for the locomotive shall attest to the  notation. If the locomotive is out of use for one or more periods of at  least 30 consecutive days each, the interval prescribed for any test or  inspection under this part may be extended by the number of days in each  period the locomotive is out of use since the last test or inspection in  question. A movement made in accordance with Sec. 229.9 is not a use for  purposes of determining the period of the out-of-use credit.</p>
