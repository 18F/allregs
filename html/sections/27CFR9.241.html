For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Paso Robles Estrella District'' and ``Paso Robles Estrella'' are terms of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The five United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Paso Robles Estrella District viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paso Robles, Calif., 1948, photorevised 1979;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> San Miguel, Calif., 1948, photorevised 1979;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ranchito Canyon, Calif., 1948, photorevised 1976;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Estrella, Calif., 1948, photorevised 1979; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Shandon, Calif., 1961.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary.
