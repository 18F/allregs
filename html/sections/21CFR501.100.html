the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the act if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that such food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret.

the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.</p>
