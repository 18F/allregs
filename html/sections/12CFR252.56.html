                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Potential impact on capital. In conducting a stress test under Sec. Sec. 252.54 and 252.55, for each quarter of the planning horizon, a covered company must estimate the following for each scenario required to be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Losses, pre-provision net revenue, provision for loan and lease losses, and net income; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The potential impact on pro forma regulatory capital levels and pro forma capital ratios (including regulatory capital ratios, the tier 1 common ratio, and any other capital ratios specified by the Board), incorporating the effects of any capital actions over the planning horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses appropriate for credit exposures throughout the planning horizon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assumptions regarding capital actions. In conducting a stress test under Sec. Sec. 252.54 and 252.55, a covered company is required to make the following assumptions regarding its capital actions over the planning horizon:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the first quarter of the planning horizon, the covered company must take into account its actual capital actions as of the end of that quarter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each of the second through ninth quarters of the planning horizon, the covered company must include in the projections of capital:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Common stock dividends equal to the quarterly average dollar amount of common stock dividends that the company paid in the previous year (that is, the first quarter of the planning horizon and the preceding three calendar quarters);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payments on any other instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio equal to the stated dividend, interest, or principal due on such instrument during the quarter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An assumption of no redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An assumption of no issuances of common stock or preferred stock, except for issuances related to expensed employee compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Controls and oversight of stress testing processes--(1) In general. The senior management of a covered company must establish and maintain a system of controls, oversight, and documentation, including policies and procedures, that are designed to ensure that its stress testing processes are effective in meeting the requirements in this subpart. These policies and procedures must, at a minimum, describe the covered company's stress testing practices and methodologies, and processes for validating and updating the company's stress test practices and methodologies consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance. Policies of covered companies must also describe processes for scenario development for the mid-cycle stress test required under Sec. 252.55.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The board of directors, or a committee thereof, of a covered company must review and approve the policies and procedures of the stress testing processes as frequently as economic conditions or the condition of the covered company may warrant, but no less than annually. The board of directors and senior management of the covered company must receive a summary of the results of any stress test conducted under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Role of stress testing results. The board of directors and senior management of each covered company must consider the results of the analysis it conducts under this subpart, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As part of the covered company's capital plan and capital planning process, including when making changes to the covered company's capital structure (including the level and composition of capital);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When assessing the covered company's exposures, concentrations, and risk positions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the development or implementation of any plans of the covered company for recovery or resolution.</p>
