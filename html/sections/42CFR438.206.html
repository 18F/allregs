In establishing and maintaining the network, each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must consider the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The anticipated Medicaid enrollment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expected utilization of services, taking into consideration the characteristics and health care needs of specific Medicaid populations represented in the particular MCO, PIHP, and PAHP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The numbers and types (in terms of training, experience, and specialization) of providers required to furnish the contracted Medicaid services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The numbers of network providers who are not accepting new Medicaid patients.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The geographic location of providers and Medicaid enrollees, considering distance, travel time, the means of transportation ordinarily used by Medicaid enrollees, and whether the location provides physical access for Medicaid enrollees with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides female enrollees with direct access to a women's health specialist within the network for covered care necessary to provide women's routine and preventive health care services. This is in addition to the enrollee's designated source of primary care if that source is not a women's health specialist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides for a second opinion from a qualified health care professional within the network, or arranges for the enrollee to obtain one outside the network, at no cost to the enrollee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the network is unable to provide necessary services, covered under the contract, to a particular enrollee, the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP must adequately and timely cover these services out of network for the enrollee, for as long as the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is unable to provide them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requires out-of-network providers to coordinate with the MCO or PIHP with respect to payment and ensures that cost to the enrollee is no greater than it would be if the services were furnished within the network.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Demonstrates that its providers are credentialed as required by Sec.  438.214.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Furnishing of services. The State must ensure that each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP contract complies with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timely access. Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meet and require its providers to meet State standards for timely access to care and services, taking into account the urgency of the need for services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that the network providers offer hours of operation that are no less than the hours of operation offered to commercial enrollees or comparable to Medicaid fee-for-service, if the provider serves only Medicaid enrollees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make services included in the contract available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when medically necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Establish mechanisms to ensure compliance by providers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Monitor providers regularly to determine compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Take corrective action if there is a failure to comply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cultural considerations.
