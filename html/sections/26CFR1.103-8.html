                                Sec. 1.103-8  Interest on bonds to finance certain exempt facilities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under section 103(b)(4),  interest paid on an issue of obligations issued by a State or local  governmental unit (as defined in Sec. 1.103-1) is not includable in  gross income if substantially all of the proceeds of such issue is to be  used to provide one or more of the exempt facilities listed in  subparagraphs (A)   through (J) of section 103(b)(4) and in this section. However, interest  on an obligation of such issue is includable in gross income if the  obligation is held by a substantial user or a related person (as  described in section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11). If substantially  all of the proceeds of a bond issue is to be used to provide such exempt  facilities, the debt obligations are treated as obligations described in  section 103(a)(1) and Sec. 1.103-1 even though such obligations are  industrial development bonds as defined in section 103(b)(2) and Sec.  1.103-7. Substantially all of the proceeds of an issue of governmental  obligations are used to provide an exempt facility if 90 percent or more  of such proceeds are so used. For purposes of this ``substantially all''  test, two rules apply. First, proceeds are reduced by amounts properly  allocable on a pro rata basis between providing the exempt facility and  other uses of the proceeds. Second, amounts used to provide an exempt  facility include amounts paid or incurred which are chargeable to the  facility's capital account or would be so chargeable either with a  proper election by a taxpayer (for example, under section 266) or but  for a proper election by a taxpayer to deduct such amounts. In the event  the amount payable with respect to an issue during each annual period  over its term is less than the amount of interest accruing thereon in  such period, e.g., in the case of an issue sold by the issuer for less  than its face amount, see paragraph (a)(6) of this section to determine  the amount of proceeds of the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall  also apply to an issue of obligations substantially all of the proceeds  of which is to be used to provide exempt facilities described in this  section and for either or both of the following purposes: (a) To acquire  or develop land as the site for an industrial park described in section  103(b)(5) and Sec. 1.103-9, (b) to provide facilities to be used by an  exempt person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 103(b)(4) only becomes applicable where the bond issue  meets both the trade or business and the security interest tests so that  obligations are industrial development bonds within the meaning of  section 103(b)(2). For rules as to exempt facilities including property  functionally related and subordinate to such facilities, see  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For rules with respect to the  ultimate use of proceeds of obligations, see subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph. For rules which limit the application of the provisions of  this section see subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. For the  interrelationship of the rules provided in this section and the  exemption for certain small issues provided in section 103(b)(6), see  Sec. 1.103-10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public use requirement. To qualify under section 103(b)(4) and  this section as an exempt facility, a facility must serve or be  available on a regular basis for general public use, or be a part of a  facility so used, as contrasted with similar types of facilities which  are constructed for the exclusive use of a limited number of nonexempt  persons in their trades or businesses. For example, a private dock or  wharf owned by or leased to, and serving only a single manufacturing  plant would not qualify as a facility for general public use, but a  hangar or repair facility at a municipal airport, or a dock or a wharf,  would qualify even if it is owned by, or leased or permanently assigned  to, a nonexempt person provided that such nonexempt person directly  serves the general public, such as a common passenger carrier or freight  carrier. Similarly, an airport owned or operated by a nonexempt person  for general public use is a facility for public use, as is a dock or  wharf which is a part of a public port. However, a landing strip which,  by reason of a formal or informal agreement or by reason of geographic  location, will not be available for general public use does not satisfy  the public use requirement. Sewage or solid waste disposal facilities  and air or water pollution control facilities, described in sections  103(b)(4) (E) and (F) and paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, will  be treated in all events as serving a general public use although they  may be part of a nonpublic facility such as a manufacturing facility  used in the trade or business of a nonexempt user.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Functionally related and subordinate. An exempt facility  includes any land, building, or other property functionally related and  subordinate to   such facility. Property is not functionally related and subordinate to a  facility if it is not of a character and size commensurate with the  character and size of such facility. Since substantially all of the  proceeds of a bond issue must be used for the exempt facility (or for  any combination of exempt facilities, industrial parks, and facilities  to be used by exempt persons), including property functionally related  and subordinate thereto, an insubstantial amount of the proceeds of a  bond issue may be used for facilities which are neither exempt  facilities (or a combination of exempt facilities, industrial parks and  facilities to be used by exempt persons) nor functionally related and  subordinate to exempt facilities. Thus, for example, where substantially  all of the proceeds of an urban redevelopment bond issue are to be used  by a State urban redevelopment agency for residential real property for  family units within the meaning of section 103(b)(4)(A) and paragraph  (b) of this section, an insubstantial amount may be used for an  industrial or commercial project or for any other purpose that is not  functionally related and subordinate to the residential real property  for family units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> and in this section is to be resolved by reference  to the ultimate use of such proceeds. For example, such proceeds will be  treated as used to provide residential rental property whether the State  or local governmental unit (i) constructs such property and leases or  sells it to any person who is not an exempt person for use in such  person's trade or business of leasing such property; (ii) lends the  proceeds to any such person for such purpose; or (iii) lends the  proceeds to banks or other financial institutions in order to increase  the supply of funds for mortgage lending under conditions requiring such  banks or other financial institutions to use such proceeds only for  further lending for residential rental property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Limitation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A facility qualifies under this section only to  the extent that there is a valid reimbursement allocation under Sec.  1.150-2 with respect to expenditures that are incurred before the issue  date of the bonds to provide the facility and that are to be paid with  the proceeds of the issue. In addition, if the original use of the  facility begins before the issue date of the bonds, the facility does  not qualify under this section if any person that was a substantial user  of the facility at any time during the 5-year period before the issue  date or any related person to that user receives (directly or  indirectly) 5 percent or more of the proceeds of the issue for the  user's interest in the facility and is a substantial user of the  facility at any time during the 5-year period after the issue date,  unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An official intent for the facility is adopted under Sec.  1.150-2 within 60 days after the date on which acquisition,  construction, or reconstruction of that facility commenced; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For an acquisition, no person that is a substantial user or  related person after the acquisition date was also a substantial user  more than 60 days before the date on which the official intent was  adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section,  substantial user has the meaning used in section 147(a)(1), related  person has the meaning used in section 144(a)(3), and a user that is a  governmental unit within the meaning of Sec. 1.103-1 is disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except to the extent provided in Sec. Sec. 1.142-4(d), 1.148- 11A(i), and 1.150-2(j), this paragraph (a)(5) applies to bonds issued  after June 30, 1993, and sold before July 8, 1997. See Sec. 1.142-4(d)  for   rules relating to bonds sold on or after July 8, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Deep discount obligations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise provided in  paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the proceeds of any issue of  obligations sold by the issuer after June 4, 1982, shall include any  imputed proceeds of the issue. The imputed proceeds of an issue equal  the sum of the amounts of imputed proceeds for each annual period  (hereinafter, bond year) over the term of the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of imputed proceeds for a bond year equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The sum of the amounts of interest that will accrue with respect  to each obligation that is part of the issue in such year, reduced (but  not below zero) by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The sum of the amounts of principal and interest that become  payable with respect to the issue in that bond year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interest will be deemed to accrue with respect to an  obligation on an amount that, as of the commencement of that year, is  equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The purchase price (as defined in Sec. 1.103-13(d)(2))  allocable to the obligation and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The aggregate of the amounts of interest accruing in each prior  bond year with respect to the obligation, reduced by all amounts that  became payable with respect to the obligation in prior bond years. Any  amount that becomes payable during the 30 day period following any bond  year will be deemed to have become payable in such bond year. Thus, to  the extent interest on an obligation accruing during a bond year does  not become payable within 30 days from the end of such year, it is  treated as reinvested under the same terms as the obligation. For  purposes of this subparagraph (6), the rate at which such interest  accrues is equal to the yield of the obligation. Yield is computed in  the same manner as set forth in Sec. 1.103-13(c)(1)(ii) for computing  yield on governmental obligations (assuming annual compounding of  interest). Such computations shall be made without regard to optional  call dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Deep discount obligations; special rules. (i) There are no  imputed proceeds with respect to an obligation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The obligation does not have a stated interest rate  (determinable at the date of issue) that increases over the term of the  obligation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The purchase price of the obligation is at least 95 percent of  its face amount.  At the option of the issuer, any obligation described in the preceding  sentence may be disregarded in computing the imputed proceeds of the  issue. Payments with respect to such obligations are also disregarded in  determining the amount payable with respect to the issue in that bond  year. If each obligation which is part of an issue is described in this  subdivision (i), there are no imputed proceeds with respect to the  issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the actual rate at which interest is to accrue over the term  of an obligation is indeterminable at the date of issue then, in  computing the yield of the obligation for purposes of this paragraph,  such rate shall be determined as if the conditions as of the date of  issue will not change over the term of the obligation. Thus, for  example, if interest on an obligation is to be paid semiannually at a  rate equal to 80 percent of the yield on six month Treasury bills at the  most recent public sale immediately prior to the corresponding interest  payment date and the yield on six month Treasury bills sold immediately  preceding the issue date is 10 percent, then the six month Treasury bill  rate is deemed to be a constant 10 percent for purposes of determining  the amount of imputed proceeds of the issue. Therefore, all interest  payments on the obligation would be deemed to be made at a rate of 8  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. State A issues its bonds and plans to use substantially  all of the proceeds from such bond issue to purchase land and build a  facility which will be used for one of the purposes described in section  103(b)(4) and this section. The arrangement provides that (1) A will  issue bonds with a face amount of $21 million and with all accrued  interest payable annually, the proceeds of which (after deducting bond  election costs, costs of publishing notices, attorneys' fees, printing  costs, trustees' fees for fiscal   agents, and similar expenses) will be $20 million; (2) $18 million of  the proceeds of the bond issue will be used to purchase land and to  construct such facility; (3) $2 million of the proceeds will be used for  an unrelated facility which will be used by X, a nonexempt person, in a  separate trade or business and for a purpose not described in section  103(b) (4) or (5); (4) X will rent both facilities for 20 years at an  annual rental equal to the amount necessary to amortize the principal  and pay the interest annually on the outstanding bonds; and (5) such  payments by X and the facilities will be the security for the bonds. On  these facts, substantially all of the proceeds will be used in  connection with an exempt facility described in section 103(b)(4) and  this section. Accordingly, section 103(b)(1) does not apply to the bonds  unless such bonds are thereafter held by a person who is a substantial  user of the facilities or a related person within the meaning of section  103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On July 1, 1982, State B sells an issue of its  obligations to an underwriter in anticipation of a public offering. The  initial offering price is $18,627,639.69 of which $17,000,000 is to be  used to construct a pollution control facility described in section  103(b)(4)(F). X Corporation, a nonexempt person, is to use the facility  and, in exchange, is obligated to pay an amount equal to the face amount  of the issue when it becomes due. The obligations are issued on August  1, 1982. The face amount of the issue is $30,000,000. The issue is a  term issue with all obligations maturing on August 1, 1987. The issue  bears no stated rate of interest; there are no interest coupons on the  obligations. The bonds are industrial development bonds with a yield  (based upon annual compounding) of ten percent. Based on these facts,  the amount of imputed proceeds with respect to the issue is determined  as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Purchase price</p><p class="depth0">plus                           Imputed</p><p class="depth0">Date                                 accumulated       Interest        proceeds</p><p class="depth0">interest ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aug. 1, 1983...................................................   $18,627,639.69   $1,862,763.97   $1,862,763.97 Aug. 1, 1984...................................................    20,490,403.68    2,049,040.37    2,049,040.37 Aug. 1, 1985...................................................    22,539,444.03    2,253,944.40    2,253,944.40 Aug. 1, 1986...................................................    24,793,388.43    2,479,338.84    2,479,338.84 Aug. 1, 1987...................................................    27,272,727.27    2,727,272.73               0</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total imputed proceeds.......................................  ...............  ..............    8,645,087.58 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Therefore, proceeds of the issue equal $27,272,727.27 less issuance  costs. Substantially all of the bond proceeds are not used to provide an  exempt facility, and section 103(b)(1) applies to the issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as example (2) except that the  issue has a face amount and purchase price of $18,500,000. The issue  also provides for one payment in addition to the redemption payment, in  the amount of $10,267,668 payable on or after August 1, 1986, one year  before maturity. Section 103(b)(1) applies to the issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On July 1, 1982, City E sells an issue of industrial  development bonds to provide for a convention facility, as described in  section 103(b)(4)(C). Assume that the bonds are issued on that date as  well. The issue has a face amount of $15,240,000 and a purchase price of  $11,929,382.53. The estimated cost of the facility is $11,000,000. The  bonds are ``zero coupon'' bonds, i.e., there are no interest coupons.  Each series is initially offered for less than 95 percent of its face  amount. The issue matures serially over a five year period, with each  series being allocated a part of the purchase price of the issue.

There are no imputed proceeds because the amount payable on the issue in  each bond year exceeds the total amount of interest accruing on the  issue during such bond year. Section 103(b)(1) does not apply to the  bonds unless such bonds are held by a person who is a substantial user  of the facility or a related person within the meaning of section  103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5.

C receives $30 million  in exchange for the bonds which will be used to provide the facility.  The bonds mature on July 1, 2002. Each bond provides for an annual  interest payment equal to ten percent of the face amount of the bond,  with the last payment thereon (on July 1, 2002) including a return of  the principal amount of the bond. The proceeds of the issue are $30  million. Section 103(b)(1) does not apply to the bonds unless such bonds  are held by a person who is a substantial user of the facility or a  related person within the meaning of section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103- 11.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6.

Such bonds also provide a put  option annually thereafter. There are no imputed proceeds (without  regard to Sec. 1.103-8(a)(7)), and the result is the same as example  (5).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. On July 1, 1982, City F sells an issue of industrial  development bonds in the face amount of $20 million to acquire a parking  facility as described in section 103(b)(4)(D).

Each bond that is part of  the issue bears annual interest coupons, each of which is in an amount  equal to ten percent of the face amount of the bond. Each maturity has a  face amount of $2,000,000.

For purposes of this section, obligations  issued after April 24, 1979, may be treated as issued before April 25,  1979, if the transitional requirements of section 1104 of the Mortgage  Subsidy Bond Tax Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 2670) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Residential rental project. (i) In general. A residential rental  project is a building or structure, together with any functionally  related and subordinate facilities, containing one or more similarly  constructed units--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which are used on other than a transient basis, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(5)(i)</em> of this  section and are available to members of the general public in accordance  with the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  Substantially all of each project must contain such units and  functionally related and subordinate facilities. Hotels, motels,  dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming houses, hospitals,  nursing homes, sanitariums, rest homes, and trailer parks and courts for  use on a transient basis are not residential rental projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple buildings. (a) Proximate buildings or structures  (hereinafter ``buildings'') which have similarly constructed units are  treated as part of the same project if they are owned for Federal tax  purposes by the same person and if the buildings are financed pursuant  to a common plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Buildings are proximate if they are located on a single tract of  land. The term ``tract'' means any parcel or parcels of land which are  contiguous except for the interposition of a road, street, stream or  similar property. Otherwise, parcels are contiguous if their boundaries  meet at one or more points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A common plan of financing exists if, for example, all such  buildings are provided by the same issue or several issues subject to a  common indenture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Functionally related and subordinate facilities. Under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, facilities that are functionally  related and subordinate to residential rental projects include  facilities for use by the tenants, for example, swimming pools, other  recreational facilities, parking areas, and other facilities which are  reasonably required for the project, for example, heating and cooling  equipment, trash disposal equipment or units for resident managers or  maintenance personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Owner-occupied residences. For purposes of section 103  (b)(4)(A) and this paragraph (b), the term ``residential rental  project'' does not include any building or structure which contains  fewer than five units, one unit of which is occupied by an owner of the  units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirement must be continuously satisfied--(i) Rental  requirement. Once available for occupancy, each unit (as defined in  paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section) in a residential rental project  must be rented or available for rental on a continuous basis during the  longer of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The remaining term of the obligation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(7)</em> of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Low or moderate income occupancy requirement. Individuals or  families of low or moderate income must occupy that percentage of  completed units in such project applicable to the project under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section continuously during the qualified  project period. For this purpose, a unit occupied by an individual or  family who at the commencement of the occupancy is of low or moderate  income is treated as occupied by such an individual or family during  their tenancy in such unit, even though they subsequently cease to be of  low or moderate income. Moreover, such unit is treated as occupied by an  individual or family of low or moderate income until reoccupied, other  than for a temporary period, at which time the character of the unit  shall be redetermined. In no event shall such temporary period exceed 31  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effect of post-issuance noncompliance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Unless  corrected within a reasonable period, noncompliance with the  requirements of this paragraph (b) shall cause the project to be treated  as other than a project described in section 103 (b)(4)(A) and this  paragraph (b) as of the date of issue. After an issue to provide such  project ceases to qualify, subsequent conformity with the requirements  will not alter the taxable status of such issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Correction of noncompliance. If the issuer corrects any  noncompliance arising from events occurring after the issuance of the  obligation within a reasonable period, such noncompliance (e.g., an  unauthorized sublease) shall not cause the project to be a project not  described in this paragraph (b). A reasonable period is at least 60 days  after such error is first discovered or would have been discovered by  the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Involuntary loss. (a) The requirements of paragraph (b) shall  cease to apply to a project in the event of involuntary noncompliance  caused by fire, seizure, requisition, foreclosure, transfer of title by  deed in lieu of foreclosure, change in a Federal law or an action of a  Federal agency after the date of issue which prevents an issuer from  enforcing the requirements of this paragraph, or condemnation or similar  event but only if, within a reasonable period, either the obligation  used to provide such project is retired or amounts received as a  consequence of such event are used to provide a project which meets the  requirement of section 103 (b)(4)(A) and this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(4)(iv)(a))</em> or a related person (as defined in Sec. 1.103-10(e))  obtains an ownership interest in such project for tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Qualified project period. The term ``qualified project period''  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For obligations issued after April 24, 1979, and prior to  September 4, 1982, a period of 20 years commencing on the later of the  date that the project becomes available for occupancy or the date of  issue of the obligations. The requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of  this section shall be deemed met if the owner of the project contracts  with a Federal or state agency to maintain at least 20 percent (or 15  percent in the case of targeted areas) of the units for low or moderate  income individuals or families (as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(v) of  this section) for 20 years in consideration for rent subsidies for such  individuals or families for such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For obligations issued after September 3, 1982, a period  beginning on the later of the first day on which at least 10 percent of  the units in the project are first occupied or the date of issue of an  obligation described in section 103(b)(4)(A) and this paragraph and  ending on the later of the date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which is 10 years after the date on which at least 50 percent of  the units in the project are first occupied,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Which is a qualified number of days after the date on which any  of the units in the project is first occupied, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> On which any assistance provided with respect to the project  under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 terminates.  For purposes of this paragraph (b)(7)(ii), the term ``qualified number  of days'' means 50 percent of the total number of days comprising the  term of the obligation with the longest maturity in the issue used to  provide the project. In the case of a refunding of such an issue, the  longest maturity is equal to the sum of the period the prior issue was  outstanding and the longest term of any refunding obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Other definitions. For purposes of this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unit. The term ``unit'' means any accommodation containing  separate and complete facilities for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,  and sanitation. Such accommodations may be served by centrally located  equipment, such as air conditioning or heating. Thus, for example, an  apartment containing a living area, a sleeping area, bathing and  sanitation facilities, and cooking facilities equipped with a cooking  range, refrigerator, and sink, all of which are separate and distinct  from other apartments, would constitute a unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In registered form. The term ``in registered form'' has the  same meaning as in section 6049. With respect to obligations issued  after December 31, 1982, such term shall have the same meaning as  prescribed in section 103(j) (including the regulations thereunder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Targeted area project. The term ``targeted area project''  means a project located in a qualified census tract (as defined in Sec.  6a.103A-2(b)(4)) or an area of chronic economic distress (as defined in  Sec. 6a.103A-2(b)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Building or structure. The term ``building or structure''  generally means a discrete edifice or other man-made construction  consisting of an independent foundation, outer walls, and roof. A single  unit which is not an   entire building but is merely a part of a building is not a building or  structure within the meaning of this section. As such, while single  townhouses are not buildings if their foundation, outer walls, and roof  are not independent, detached houses and rowhouses are buildings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Low or moderate income. Individuals and families of low or  moderate income shall be determined in a manner consistent with  determinations of lower income families under section 8 of the United  States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, except that the percentage of  median gross income which qualifies as low or moderate income shall be  80 percent. Therefore, occupants of a unit are considered individuals or  families of low or moderate income only if their adjusted income  (computed in the manner prescribed with Sec. 1.167(k)-3(b)(3)) does not  exceed 80 percent of the median gross income for the area.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occupants of a unit shall not be  considered to be of low or moderate income if all the occupants are  students (as defined in section 151(e)(4)), no one of whom is entitled  to file a joint return under section 6013. The method of determining low  or moderate income in effect on the date of issue will be determinative  for such issue, even if such method is subsequently changed. In the  event programs under section 8(f) of the Housing Act of 1937, as  amended, are terminated prior to the date of issue, the applicable  method shall be that in effect immediately prior to the date of such  termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In August 1982, City X issues $10 million of registered  bonds with a term of 20 years to be used to finance the construction of  an apartment building to be available to members of the general public.  X loans the proceeds of the bonds to Corporation M, the tax owner of the  project. The loan is secured by a promissory note from M and a mortgage  on the project. The mortgage requires annual payments sufficient to  amortize the principal and interest on the bonds. Corporation M  maintains 20 percent of the units in the project for low or moderate  income individuals and meets all of the requirements of this section  until 2002, at which time M converts the project to offices. The bonds  are industrial development bonds, but because the proceeds are used for  construction of residential rental property, which is an exempt facility  under section 103(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section, section  103(b)(1) does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the  building is constructed adjacent to a factory, and the factory employees  are to be given preference in selecting tenants. The bonds are  industrial development bonds and the facility is not an exempt facility  under section 103(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section because it  is not a facility constructed for use by the general public.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the  proceeds of the obligation are provided to N, a cooperative housing  corporation, to finance the construction of a cooperative housing  project. N sells stock in such cooperative to shareholders, some of whom  occupy the units in the cooperative and some of whom rent the units to  other persons. Such project is not a residential rental project within  the meaning of section 103(b)(4)(A) and Sec. 1.103-8(b) because less  than all of the units in the building are used for rental. Further, the  bonds are mortgage subsidy bonds under section 103A because more than a  significant portion of the proceeds are used to provide financing for  residences, some of which are owner-occupied and some of which are used  in the trade or business of rental.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On February 1, 1984, County Z issues registered  obligations with a term of 3 years and loans the proceeds to Corporation  V to construct a garden apartment project for tenants who are 65 years  or older. The mortgage on the project secures the loan. At the end of 3  years, V obtains permanent financing for the project from a commercial  lender. The project is not a targeted area project. V has not contracted  with any Federal or State agency to provide rental assistance under  section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. As a condition for  providing financing for construction, Z requires that the deed to the  project contain a covenant that requires the project be used for elderly  tenants and restricts occupancy of 20 percent of the units in the  project to individuals or families of low or moderate income. Further,  the deed provides that ``Such covenant shall run with and bind the land,  from the date that ten percent of the units in the project are first  occupied until ten years after the date that at least half the units are  first occupied. The right to enforce these restrictions is vested in  County Z.'' In 1990, however, less than 20 percent of the units are  occupied by families or individuals of low or moderate incomes, and  three months after learning of this condition County Z had not   commenced enforcement of the covenant. Although on the date of issue the  proceeds of the obligation were used to provide a residential rental  project, the obligation will not be treated as providing a residential  rental project within the meaning of section 103(b)(4)(A) as of February  1, 1984, because the project did not meet the requirements of this  paragraph for at least 10 years after at least 50 percent of the units  are first occupied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On January 15, 1983, State X issues registered  obligations with a term of 15 years, the proceeds of which are loaned to  Corporation P to construct an apartment building. The project will be a  ``targeted area project'', within the meaning of Sec. 1.103- 8(b)(8)(iii). Corporation P intends to rent all the units to individuals  for their residences, maintaining 15 percent of the units in the project  for individuals having low or moderate incomes, for 15 years. In 1988,  however, Corporation P converts 80 percent of the units to condominiums.  Corporation P repays the loan to State X which, in turn, redeems the  obligations. The obligations are not used to provide a residential  rental project within the meaning of section 103(b)(4)(A), and all the  interest paid or to be paid on such obligations will be includable in  gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On January 15, 1984, State Z issues registered  obligations with a term of 15 years the proceeds of which will be used  to acquire and renovate a residential apartment building. Z sells the  project to Corporation U and receives a 30-year mortgage. On June 1,  1985, the first occupants of the project commence their tenancies. At  least 50 percent of the units in the project are occupied on July 1,  1985. On January 15, 1988, Z issues 35-year refunding bonds the proceeds  of which are used to retire the obligations issued in 1984. The prior  issue will be discharged by March 15, 1988. In order to meet the  requirement of Sec. 1.103-8(b)(5)(ii), at least 20 percent of such  units must be occupied by individuals of low or moderate income until  January 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in example (6) except that in  1987, the apartment building is substantially destroyed by fire. The  building was insured at its fair market value. U does not intend to  reconstruct the building but uses a portion of the insurance proceeds to  repay the unpaid balance of the mortgage. Z uses this amount to redeem  the outstanding bonds at the first available call date. Since the  project was substantially destroyed by fire and the outstanding bonds  are retired at the first available call date, the requirements of  section 103(b)(4)(A) and this paragraph (b) are satisfied with respect  to the obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as in example (6) except that in  1987 U defaults on the mortgage, and Z obtains title to the project  without instituting foreclosure proceedings. Z sells the project to S  and uses the proceeds to retire the outstanding bonds. Since S did not  obtain the project with obligations described in section 103(b)(4), S is  not required to meet the requirements of section 103(b)(4)(A) and this  paragraph. Further, the 1984 obligations are obligations described in  section 103(b)(4)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. In September 1983, State W issues $10 million of  registered bonds with a term of 3 years, the proceeds of which are to be  loaned to Corporation V to finance the construction of an apartment  building in a rural community. At the end of 3 years, V obtains  permanent financing from Federal Agency T. Agency T will not allow the  deed to contain any restrictive covenant relating to the use of the  project. Under Federal law, however, T requires that V maintain all of  the units in the project for rental to low-income farmworkers for the  term of the mortgage, which is 20 years. Further, the mortgage between T  and V provides that if T determines that low-income housing is no longer  required in the community in which the project is constructed then the  repayment of the mortgage may be accelerated. T determines as of the  date of issue that low-income housing will be needed in the community  for at least 20 years. In 1987, the project fails to meet the  requirements of section 1.103-8(b)(5)(ii), relating to occupancy by  individuals or families of low or moderate income. Further, T does not  require V to correct the failure. Based on the foregoing, the bonds  issued by W will be treated as described in section 103(b)(4)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The facts are the same as in example (9) except that in  1987, the Federal law is amended to provide that Agency T may not  enforce its low-income occupancy requirement. The result is the same.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. The facts are the same as in example (9) except that in  1987 Agency T determines that due to a change in circumstances in the  community in which the project is located low-income rental housing is  no longer required. As such, T requires V to repay the mortgage. Since  the obligations have been repaid, W has no legal right to enforce the  requirements of paragraph (b) with respect to the project. Subsequent  nonconformity of the project with the requirements of Sec. 1.103-8(b)  under these circumstances will not cause the obligations issued by W to  be industrial development bonds within the meaning of section 103(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Obligations issued before April 25, 1979--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rules.  Section 103(b)(1) shall not apply to obligations issued before April 25,  1979, which are part of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of  which are to be used to provide residential real property for family  units. In order to qualify under this   paragraph (b) as an exempt facility, the facility must satisfy the  public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section by being  available for use by members of the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Family units defined. For purposes of this paragraph (b) the  term ``family unit'' means a building or any portion thereof which  contains complete living facilities which are to be used on other than a  transient basis by one or more persons, and facilities functionally  related and subordinate thereto. Thus, an apartment which is to be used  on other than a transient basis as a residence by a single person or by  a family and which contains complete facilities for living, sleeping,  eating, cooking, and sanitation, constitutes a family unit. Such a unit  may be served by centrally located machinery and equipment as in a  typical apartment building. To qualify as a family unit, the living  facilities must be a separate, self-contained building or constitute one  unit in a building substantially all of which consists of similar units,  together with functionally related and subordinate facilities and areas.  Hotels, motels, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming  houses, hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes, and trailer parks and courts  for use on a transient basis do not constitute residential real property  for family units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Functionally related and subordinate facilities. Under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, facilities which are functionally  related and subordinate to residential real property actually used for  family units include, for example, facilities for use by the occupants  such as a swimming pool, a parking area, and recreational facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sports facilities--(1) General rule. Section 103(b)(4)(B)  provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to obligations issued by  a State or local governmental unit which are part of an issue  substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide  sports facilities. In order to qualify as an exempt facility under  section 103(b)(4)(B) and this paragraph, the facility must satisfy the  public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section by being  available for use by members of the general public either as  participants or as spectators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sports facility defined. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section  103(b)(4)(B) and this paragraph, the term ``sports facilities'' includes  both outdoor and indoor facilities. The facility may be designed either  as a spectator or as a participation facility. For example, the term  includes both indoor and outdoor stadiums for baseball, football, ice  hockey, or other sports events, as well as facilities for the  participation of the general public in sports activities, such as golf  courses, ski slopes, swimming pools, tennis courts, and gymnasiums. The  term does not include, however, facilities such as a golf course,  swimming pool, or tennis court, which are constructed for use by members  of a private club or as integral or subordinate parts of a hotel or  motel, or the use of which will be restricted to a special class or  group or to guests of a particular hotel or motel, since they are not  facilities for the use of the general public as required by paragraph  (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, facilities which are  functionally related and subordinate to a sports facility, such as a  parking lot, clubhouse, ski slope warming house, bath house, or ski tow,  are considered to be part of a sports facility. A ski lodge which  consists primarily of overnight accommodations is not functionally  related and subordinate to a sports facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Convention or trade show facilities--(1) General rule. Section  103(b)(4)(C) provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to  obligations issued by a State or local governmental unit which are a  part of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be  used to provide convention or trade show facilities. In order to qualify  under section 103(b)(4)(C) and this paragraph as an exempt facility, the  facility must satisfy the public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of  this section by being available for an appropriate charge or rental, on  a rate scale basis, for use by members of the general public. The public  use requirement is not satisfied if the use of a convention or trade  show facility is limited by long-term leases to a single user or group  of users.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Convention or trade show facilities defined. For purposes of  section 103(b)(4)(C) and this paragraph, the   term ``convention or trade show facilities'' means special-purpose  buildings or structures, such as meeting halls and display areas, which  are generally used to house a convention or trade show, including, under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, facilities functionally related and  subordinate to such facilities such as parking lots or railroad sidings.  A hotel or motel which is available to the general public, whether or  not it is intended primarily to house persons attending or participating  in a convention or trade show, is neither a convention or trade show  facility nor functionally related and subordinate thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certain transportation facilities--(1) General rule. Section  103(b)(4)(D) provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to  obligations issued by a State or local governmental unit which are part  of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to  provide (i) airports, docks, wharves, mass commuting facilities, or  public parking facilities, or (ii) storage or training facilities  directly related to any such facility. In order to qualify under section  103(b)(4)(D) and this paragraph as an exempt facility, the facility must  satisfy the public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section  by being available for use by members of the general public or for use  by common carriers or charter carriers which serve members of the  general public. A dock or wharf which is part of a public port (or a  public port to be constructed in accordance with a plan which has been  finally adopted on the date the obligations in question are issued)  satisfies the public use test. A parking lot will be available for use  by the general public unless more than an insubstantial portion thereof  will be used exclusively by or for the benefit of a nonexempt person by  reason of a formal or informal agreement or by reason of the remote  geographic location of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 103(b)(4)(D) and this  paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to bonds sold at or before 5:00 p.m. EST on  December 29, 1978, an airport includes service accommodations for the  public such as terminals, retail stores in such terminals, runways,  hangars, loading facilities, repair shops, parking areas, and facilities  which, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are functionally related  and subordinate to the airport, such as facilities for the preparation  of in-flight meals, restaurants, and accommodations for temporary or  overnight use by passengers, and other facilities functionally related  to the needs or convenience of passengers, shipping companies, and  airlines. The term ``airport'' does not include a landing strip which,  by reason of a formal or informal agreement, or by reason of geographic  location, will not be available for general public use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to bonds sold after 5:00 p.m. EST on December 29,  1978--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An airport includes facilities which are directly related and  essential to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Servicing aircraft or enabling aircraft to take off and land, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transferring passengers or cargo to or from aircraft.  A facility does not satisfy either of the foregoing requirements if the  facility need not be located at, or in close proximity to, the take-off  and landing area in order to perform its function. Examples of  facilities which satisfy those requirements are terminals, runways,  hangars, loading facilities, repair shops, and land-based navigation  aids such as radar installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an airport includes  facilities other than those described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(a) only if  they are functionally related and subordinate to an airport (as defined  in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(a)). A facility (or part thereof) is not  functionally related and subordinate to an airport if the facility (or  part thereof)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is not of a character and size commensurate with the character  and size of the airport at or adjacent to which the facility is located,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not located at or adjacent to that airport.  A facility may satisfy the character and size requirement although it  provides minimal benefits to other airports. For example, a facility for  the preparation of in-flight meals which has capacity sufficient to  prepare all in-flight meals for aircraft departing the airport where the  facility is located   qualifies although some meals may be consumed in transit between other  airports. Other examples of facilities functionally related and  subordinate to an airport are restaurants and retail stores located in  terminals, ground transportation parking areas, and accommodations for  temporary or overnight use by passengers. Unimproved land (including  agricultural land) that is adjacent to an airport and that is impaired  by a significant level of airport noise is functionally related and  subordinate to the airport if after its acquisition that land will not  be converted to a use that is incompatible with the level of airport  noise. Adjacent land with existing improvements also may be functionally  related and subordinate to an airport by reason of impairment by a  significant level of airport noise but only if the use of such land  before its acquisition is incompatible with the airport noise level, its  use after acquisition is to be compatible, and the post-acquisition use  will be essentially different from the pre-acquisition use.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest in such improved land  acquired solely to mitigate damages attributable to airport noise is  treated as functionally related and subordinate to the airport. Thus,  for example, amounts allocated to imposing a servitude on improved land  adjacent to an airport restricting its future use to uses compatible  with airport noise are treated as amounts allocated to property  functionally related and subordinate to an airport. For the purpose of  determining whether land is impaired by a significant level of airport  noise, any generally accepted noise estimating methodology may be used.  For example, a Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF), a method for composite  noise rating recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration to  measure the impact of airport noise, may be used for this purpose.  Compatibility may be determined by reference to regulations or general  guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration under  section 102 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (49  U.S.C. 2102), or sections 11(3)(C) and 18(a)(4) of the Airport and  Airway Development Act of 1970, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1711(3)(C) and  1718(a)(4)), concerning uses of land impaired by a significant level of  airport noise, or, where available, by reference to the airport  compatibility plan specifically addressing what constitutes a compatible  use of that land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> As an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), an  office building (or office space within a building) or a computer  facility, either of which serves a system-wide or regional function of  an airline, is not considered part of an airport since that facility is  not described in either paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(a) or (b). However, a  maintenance or overhaul facility which services aircraft is considered  part of an airport under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(a) since that facility is  directly related and essential to servicing aircraft and must be located  where aircraft take off and land in order to perform its function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A hotel located at or adjacent to an airport satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(b), that is, it is of a character  and size commensurate with the character and size of the airport at or  adjacent to which it is located, if the number of guest rooms in the  hotel is reasonable for the size of the airport, taking into account the  current and projected passenger usage of the terminal facility. If the  hotel contains meeting rooms, the number and size of these rooms must be  in reasonable proportion to the number of guest rooms in the hotel.  Limited recreational facilities will not prevent the hotel from being of  a character and size commensurate with the character and size of the  airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A dock or wharf includes property which, under paragraph  (a)(3) of this section, is functionally related and subordinate to a  dock or wharf such as the structure alongside which a vessel docks, the  equipment needed to receive and to discharge cargo and passengers from  the vessel, such as cranes and conveyors, related storage, handling,  office, and passenger areas, and similar facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A mass commuting facility includes real property together with  improvements and personal property used therein, such as machinery,  equipment, and furniture, serving the general public commuting on a day- to-day basis by   bus, subway, rail, ferry, or other conveyance which moves over  prescribed routes. Such property also includes terminals and facilities  which, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are functionally related  and subordinate to the mass commuting facility, such as parking garages,  car barns, and repair shops. Use of mass commuting facilities by  noncommuters in common with commuters is immaterial. Thus, a terminal  leased to a common carrier bus line which serves both commuters and long  distance travelers would qualify as an exempt facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Related storage or training facility. Section 103 (b)(4)(D)  includes only those storage and training facilities which are both (i)  directly related to a facility to which subparagraph (1)(i) or (ii) of  this paragraph applies and (ii) physically located on or adjacent to  such a facility. For example, a storage facility would include a grain  elevator, silo, warehouse, or oil and gas storage tank used in  connection with a dock or wharf and located on or adjacent to such dock  or wharf. Similarly, a training facility would include a building  located at or adjacent to an airport for the training of flight  personnel or a paved area immediately adjoining a bus garage used to  train bus drivers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B Airport Authority, a political subdivision of State A,  owns and operates B Airport. B Airport Authority adds several runways.  In view of the expanded area impaired by significant levels of airport  noise, the Authority proposes to issue bonds the proceeds of which are  to be used to acquire a hospital located adjacent to the airport. The  noise level on the acquired property is 40 NEF. By reference to a noise  exposure map setting forth noncompatible land uses and by reference to  guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration, it is  established that continued use of the land for a hospital is not  compatible with the noise level. Prior to issuing the bonds, B contracts  to lease the property to Corporation C to be used for warehouse space.  Within 18 months of the bonds' issuance C will remodel the hospital  (previously owned by D, who is unrelated to C) with its own funds and  rent the facility as a warehouse. Use as a warehouse is determined to be  compatible with the level of airport noise impairing the land. The  improved land and prospective revenues from the facility's rental are  security for the proposed issuance. Based on the foregoing, the acquired  land satisfies the public use test. Furthermore, it is functionally  related and subordinate to the airport because the improvements are to  be used in an essentially different manner than prior to the land's  acquisition. The bonds are industrial development bonds. However,  section 103(b)(1) does not apply unless the provisions of section  103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11 apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that a  substantial portion of the proceeds of the bond issue is allocated to  the acquisition of a limited interest in an additional tract of land  (also impaired by airport noise measured at 40 NEF) on which an office  building stands. The limited interest holds B harmless for damages  caused by airport noise and restricts uses of the tract after the  building is retired to those compatible with noise levels caused by the  airport. Based on the foregoing, such interest satisfies the public use  test. Furthermore, the interest is functionally related and subordinate  to the airport because it is solely to mitigate damage attributable to  airport noise, in part by restricting future land uses. The bonds are  industrial development bonds. However, section 103(b)(1) does not apply  unless the provisions of section 103(b)(13) or Sec. 1.103-11 apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On June 1, 1982, M Airport Authority, a political  subdivision of State O, issues obligations, the proceeds of which are  loaned to X Corporation, a nonexempt person. X uses the proceeds to  construct a hotel adjacent to the main terminal building at M Airport. X  will be unconditionally liable for repayment of the proposed  obligations. The hotel will be used to provide temporary and overnight  accommodations for airline passengers using M Airport. The number of  rooms in the hotel is reasonable for an airport of M's size, taking into  account the current and projected passenger usage of the terminal  facility. In addition to guest rooms, the hotel will contain a  restaurant, small retail stores (such as a gift shop and newstand), and  limited recreation facilities (such as a swimming pool). The hotel will  also contain several multipurpose rooms suitable for use as meeting  rooms. The number and size of these rooms will be in reasonable  proportion to the number and size of the guest rooms in the hotel. Use  of the guest rooms, restaurant and stores, recreational facilities, and  meeting rooms by air passengers arriving at or departing from M Airport  will be incidental to the use of the hotel by air passengers for  temporary and overnight accommodations. The hotel is of a character and  size commensurate with the character and size of M Airport.  Consequently, applying the provisions of Sec. 1.103-8(e)(2), the hotel  is functionally related and subordinate to M Airport. The obligations  are industrial development bonds. Section   103(b)(1) does not apply to the obligations, however, unless the  provisions of section 103(b)(10) and Sec. 1.103-11 apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On June 1, 1982, N Airport Authority, a political  subdivision of State P, issues obligations the proceeds of which are  loaned to Y Corporation, a nonexempt person. Y uses the proceeds to  construct a hotel adjacent to the main terminal building at N Airport. Y  Corporation will be unconditionally liable for repayment of the proposed  obligations. The hotel will contain extensive recreational facilities,  including a large roof-top swimming pool, tennis courts, and a health  club. In addition, facilities for conferences consisting of a ballroom- sized meeting room capable of being partitioned by movable panels and  several smaller meeting rooms will be constructed. The number of rooms  in the hotel will substantially exceed the number which is reasonably  based on the current and projected passenger usage of the terminal  facility. Because of the presence of extensive recreational and  conference facilities, as well as the presence of on excessive number of  rooms at the hotel, the hotel fails to be of a character and size  commensurate with the character and size of N Airport. The result would  be the same if the hotel did not have extensive recreational facilities.  Consequently, the hotel is not functionally related and subordinate to N  Airport under Sec. 1.103-8(e)(2). The obligations are industrial  development bonds and interest thereon is not excluded from gross income  by reason of subsection (a)(1) or (b)(4) of section 103.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain public utility facilities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section  103(b)(4)(E) provides that section 103(b)(1) shall not apply to  obligations issued by a State or local governmental unit which are part  of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to  provide sewage disposal facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, or  facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas. In order  to qualify under section 103(b)(4)(E) as an exempt facility, the  facility must satisfy the public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of  this section. A public utility facility described in this subparagraph  (with the exception of sewage and solid waste disposal facilities which  will be treated in all events as serving the general public) will  satisfy the public use requirement only if such facility, or the output  thereof, is available for use by members of the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A facility for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas  is, for purposes of applying the public use test in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, available for use by members of the general public if (a)  the owner or operator of the facility is obligated, by a legislative  enactment, local ordinance, regulation, or the equivalent thereof, to  furnish electric energy or gas to all persons who desire such services  and who are within the service area of the owner or operator of such  facility, and (b) it is reasonably expected that such facility will  serve or be available to a large segment of the general public in such  service area. For rules with respect to facilities for the furnishing of  water, see paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 103(b)(4)(E) and this  paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``sewage disposal facilities'' means any property used  for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or  final disposal of sewage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``facilities for the local furnishing of electric  energy or gas'' means property which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Is either property of a character subject to the allowance for  depreciation provided in section 167 or land,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Is used to produce, collect, generate, transmit, store,  distribute, or convey electric energy or gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Is used in the trade or business of furnishing electric energy  or gas, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Is a part of a system providing service to the general populace  of one or more communities or municipalities, but in no event more than  2 contiguous counties (or a political equivalent) whether or not such  counties are located in one State.  For purposes of this subdivision, a city which is not within, or does  not consist of, one or more counties (or a political equivalent) shall  be treated as a county (or a political equivalent). A facility for the  generation of electric energy otherwise qualifying under this  subdivision will not be disqualified because it is connected to a system  for interconnection with other public utility systems for the emergency  transfer of electric energy. The facilities need not be located in the  area served by them. Also, the term ``facilities for the local  furnishing of electric energy or gas'' does not include coal, oil, gas,  nuclear cores, or other materials performing a similar function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Air or water pollution control facilities--(1) General rule.  Section 103(b)(4)(F) provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to  obligations issued by a State or local governmental unit which are part  of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to  provide air or water pollution control facilities. Such facilities are  in all events treated as serving the general public and, thus, satisfy  the public use requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. (i) For purposes of section 103(b)(4)(F) and this  paragraph, property is a pollution control facility to the extent that  the test of either subdivision (iii) or (iv) of this subparagraph is  satisfied, but only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It is property which is described in subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph and is either of a character subject to the allowance for  depreciation provided in section 167 or land, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Either (1) a Federal, State, or local agency exercising  jurisdiction has certified that the facility, as designed, is in  furtherance of the purpose of abating or controlling atmospheric  pollutants or contaminants, or water pollution, as the case may be, or  (2) the facility is designed to meet or exceed applicable Federal,  State, and local requirements for the control of atmospheric pollutants  or contaminants, or water pollution, as the case may be, in effect at  the time the obligations, the proceeds of which are to be used to  provide such facilities, are issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property is described in this subdivision if it is property to  be used, in whole or in part, to abate or control water or atmospheric  pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing, or storing  pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat. In the case of property to be  used to control water pollution, such property includes the necessary  intercepting sewers, pumping, power, and other equipment, and their  appurtenances. For rules relating to facilities which remove pollutants  from fuel or certain other items, see subdivision (vi) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an expenditure for property which is designed  for no significant purpose other than the control of pollution, the  total expenditure for such property satisfies the test of this  subdivision. Thus, where property which is to serve no function other  than the control of pollution is to be added to an existing  manufacturing or production facility, the total expenditure for such  property satisfies the test of this subdivision. Also, if an expenditure  for property would not be made but for the purpose of controlling  pollution, and if the expenditure has no significant purpose other than  the purpose of pollution control, the total expenditure for such  property satisfies the test of this subdivision even though such  property serves one or more functions in addition to its function as a  pollution control facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of property to be placed in service for the purpose  of controlling pollution and for a significant purpose other than  controlling pollution, only the incremental cost of such facility  satisfies the test of this subdivision. The ``incremental cost'' of  property is the excess of its total cost over that portion of its cost  expended for a purpose other than the control of pollution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An expenditure has a significant purpose other than the control  of pollution if it results in an increase in production or capacity, or  in a material extension of the useful life of a manufacturing or  production facility or a part thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Water facilities--(1) General rule. Section 103(b)(4)(G)  provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to obligations issued by  a State or local governmental unit which are part of an issue  substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide  facilities for the furnishing of water which are available, on  reasonable demand, to members of the general public. A water facility  will satisfy the public use test of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if  it will provide water, on reasonable demand, to any member of the  general public within the service area of the water system of which such  facility is a part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition. For purposes of section 103(b)(4)(G) and this  paragraph, the ``water facilities'' include artesian wells, reservoirs,  dams, related equipment and pipelines, and other facilities used to  furnish water for domestic, industrial, irrigation, or other purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph apply in the  case of facilities provided by obligations issued after January 1, 1969.  In the case of facilities provided by obligations issued on or before  such date to which section 103(b) is applicable, the provisions of  paragraph (f) of this section shall apply. For such purposes, wherever  the term ``local furnishing of electric energy or gas'' appears in  paragraph (f) of this section, such term shall be deemed to read ``local  furnishing of electric energy, gas, or water.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples. The application of section 103(b)(4) and this section  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. City B plans to issue $10 million of bonds to be used to  construct a sports stadium. The revenues from the facility and the  facility itself will be the security for the bonds. A professional  football team rents the facility on a long-term leasee for part of the  year and a professional baseball team rents the sports facility for the  remainder of the year. Tickets are sold by the teams to the general  public. The bonds are industrial development bonds, but since the  proceeds are used for a spectator facility for general public use, which  is an exempt facility under section 103(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (c) of  this section, section 103(b)(1) does not apply unless the provisions of  section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11 apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. City C plans to issue $10 million of bonds to be used to  construct a convention hall which it will own. City C plans to lease the  convention hall for 25 years to corporation Y, a nonexempt person, which  will operate and maintain it. The terms of the lease obligate Y to make  the convention hall generally available for civic, business, and  recreational shows, meetings, performances, and similar activities  serving or benefiting the community. Lease payments from Y and the  facility will be security for the bonds. The bonds are industrial  development bonds, but since the proceeds are to be used for a facility  for general public use, which is an exempt facility under section  103(b)(4)(C) and paragraph (d) of this section, section 103(b)(1) does  not apply unless the provisions of section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11  apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. City D issues $100 million of its bonds and uses the  proceeds to finance construction of an airport for the use of the  general public. D will own and operate the airport. A major portion of  the rentable space in the terminal building is leased on a long-term  basis to common carrier and non-scheduled airlines. The bonds will be  secured by the airport landing and runway charges and by payments with  respect to such long-term leases from such commercial airlines. Such  commercial airline payments are expected to constitute more than 50  percent of the total revenues from the airport. The bonds are industrial  development bonds, but since the proceeds are to be used for an airport  for use by the general public and by carriers serving the general  public, which is an exempt facility under section 103(b)(4)(D) and  paragraph (e) of this section, section 103(b)(1) does not apply unless  the provisions of section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11 apply. The  result would be the same if D hired an airport management firm to  operate the airport.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. City E issues $6 million of its bonds and uses the  proceeds to finance construction of a landing strip for airplanes to be  located adjacent to the factories of corporations Y and Z. The landing  strip will be used in the trades or businesses of Y and Z and by any  member of the general public wishing to use it. However, due to its  location, general public use will be negligible. The lease payments by Y  and Z for the use of the facility are the security for the bonds. The  bonds are industrial development bonds and the facility is not an exempt  facility under section 103(b)(4)(D) and paragraph (c) of this section  because it is not a facility constructed for general public use.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. State F and corporation Z enter into an arrangement which  provides that F will issue $10 million of its bonds and use the proceeds  to construct a facility for Z the only purpose of which is to control  air and water pollution at Z's plant. The principal and interest on the  bonds will be secured by the charges which F will impose on Z. The bonds  are industrial development bonds, but since the proceeds are to be used  for air and water pollution facilities designed to abate pollution by  private persons, such facilities are for the benefit of the general  public and are exempt facilities under section 103(b)(4)(F) and  paragraph (g) of this section. Accordingly, section 103(b)(1) does not  apply unless the provisions of section 103(b)(13) and Sec. 1.103-11  apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. City G issues $20 million of its bonds and will use $6  million to finance residential rental property which qualifies as an  exempt facility under section 103(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (b) of this  section, $9 million to finance construction of a stadium which qualifies  as an exempt facility under section 103(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (c) of  this section, and $5 million for convention facilities which qualify as  exempt facilities under section 103(b)(4)(C) and paragraph (d) of this  section. The facilities will be used in the trades or businesses of  nonexempt persons and rental payments with respect to such facilities  and the facilities themselves will be the security for the bonds. The  bonds are industrial development bonds, but since all the proceeds are  to be used for facilities which are exempt facilities under section  103(b)(4), section 103(b)(1) does not apply unless the provisions   of section 103(b)(10) and Sec. 1.103-11 apply. The result would be the  same, if; instead of using $9 million to finance construction of a  stadium, the $9 million were used to finance construction of a capitol  building. [Reg. Sec. 1.103-8].
