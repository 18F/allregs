                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debarment of an employer. The Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A to an employer or any successor in interest to that employer, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, if the Administrator, WHD finds that the employer committed a violation that meets the standards of Sec. 503.19. Where these standards are met, debarrable violations would include but not be limited to one or more acts of commission or omission which involve:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits, or working conditions to the employer's H-2B workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the Administrator, WHD for violation(s) of obligations under the job order or other H-2B obligations, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A or this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Impeding an investigation of an employer under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Employing an H-2B worker outside the area of intended employment, in an activity/activities not listed in the job order, or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A violation of the requirements of Sec. 503.16(o) or (p);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A violation of any of the provisions listed in Sec. 503.16(r);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Any other act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program requirements cannot reasonably be expected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Fraud involving the H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Application for Temporary Employment Certification, or H-2B Petition; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A material misrepresentation of fact during the registration or application process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debarment of an agent or attorney. If the Administrator, WHD finds, under this section, that an agent or attorney committed a violation as described in paragraph (a) of this section or participated in an employer's violation, the Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications to an employer represented by such agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Period of debarment. Debarment under this subpart may not be for less than 1 year or more than 5 years from the date of the final agency decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Debarment procedure. If the Administrator, WHD makes a determination to debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the Administrator, WHD will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment and inform the party subject to the notice of its right to request a debarment hearing and the timeframe under which such rights must be exercised under Sec. 503.43. If the party does not request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the notice is the final agency action and the debarment will take effect at the end of the 30-day period. The timely filing of an administrative appeal stays the debarment pending the outcome of the appeal as provided in Sec. 503.43(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Concurrent debarment jurisdiction. OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction debar under 20 CFR 655.73 or under this part. When considering debarment, OFLC and the WHD will coordinate their activities. A specific violation for which debarment is imposed will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS and DOS promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Debarment from other labor certification programs. Upon debarment under this part or 20 CFR 655.73, the debarred party will be disqualified from filing any labor certification applications or labor condition applications with the Department of Labor by, or on behalf of, the debarred party for the same period of time set forth in the final debarment decision.</p>
