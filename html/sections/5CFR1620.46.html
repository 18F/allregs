The agency making payments to the record keeper for all contributions and attributable breakage will obtain from prior employing agencies whatever information is necessary to make accurate payments. If a prior employing agency is ultimately chargeable under Sec. 1620.43(b) for all or part of this expense, the agency making the payments to the record keeper will determine the procedure to follow in order to collect amounts owed to it by the agency ultimately chargeable with the expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment schedule; matching contributions report. Agencies will, with the employee's consent, prepare a payment schedule for making retroactive employee contributions which will be consistent with the procedures established at 5 CFR part 1605 for the correction of employing agency errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency automatic (1%) contributions. Employing agencies must calculate the agency automatic (1%) contributions for all reemployed (or restored) FERS employees and report those contributions to the record keeper within 60 days of reemployment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Forfeiture restoration. When notified by an employee that a forfeiture of the agency automatic (1%) contributions occurred after the employee separated to perform military service, the employing agency must complete and file the appropriate paper TSP form with the TSP record keeper in accordance with the form's instructions to have those funds restored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Thrift Savings Plan Service Computation Date. The agencies must include the period of military service in the Thrift Savings Plan Service Computation Date (TSP-SCD) of all reemployed FERS employees. If the period of military service has not been credited, the agencies must submit an employee data record to the TSP record keeper containing the correct TSP Service Computation Date.
