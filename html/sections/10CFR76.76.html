                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Backfitting is defined as the modification of, or addition  to, systems, structures, or components of a plant; or to the procedures  or organization required to operate a plant; any of which may result  from a new or amended provision in the Commission rules or the  imposition of a regulatory staff position interpreting the Commission  rules that is either new or different from a previous NRC staff  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the  Commission shall require a systematic and documented analysis pursuant  to paragraph (b) of this section for backfits which it seeks to impose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the  Commission shall require the backfitting of a plant only when it  determines, based on the analysis described in paragraph (b) of this  section, that there is a substantial increase in the overall protection  of the public health and safety or the common defense and security to be  derived from the backfit and that the direct and indirect costs of  implementation for that plant are justified in view of this increased  protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section  are inapplicable and, therefore, backfit analysis is not required and  the standards in paragraph (a)(3) of this section do not apply where the  Commission or staff, as appropriate, finds and declares, with  appropriately documented evaluation for its finding, any of the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That a modification is necessary to bring a plant into  compliance with a certificate or the rules or orders of the Commission,  or into conformance with   written commitments by the Corporation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That regulatory action is necessary to ensure that the plant  provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the public and  is in accord with the common defense and security; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the regulatory action involves defining or redefining  what level of protection to the public health and safety or common  defense and security should be regarded as adequate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Commission shall always require the backfitting of a plant  if it determines that the regulatory action is necessary to ensure that  the plant provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the  public and is in accord with the common defense and security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The documented evaluation required by paragraph (a)(4) of this  section must include a statement of the objectives of and reasons for  the modification and the basis for invoking the exception. If immediate  effective regulatory action is required, then the documented evaluation  may follow, rather than precede, the regulatory action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If there are two or more ways to achieve compliance with a  certificate or the rules or orders of the Commission, or with written  Corporation commitments, or there are two or more ways to reach a level  of protection which is adequate, then ordinarily the Corporation is free  to choose the way which best suits its purposes. However, should it be  necessary or appropriate for the Commission to prescribe a specific way  to comply with its requirements or to achieve adequate protection, then  cost may be a factor in selecting the way, provided that the objective  of compliance or adequate protection is met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In reaching the determination required by paragraph (a)(3) of  this section, the Commission will consider how the backfit should be  scheduled in light of other ongoing regulatory activities at the plant  and, in addition, will consider information available concerning any of  the following factors as may be appropriate and any other information  relevant and material to the proposed backfit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Statement of the specific objectives that the proposed backfit  is designed to achieve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General description of the activity that would be required by  the Corporation in order to complete the backfit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Potential change in the risk to the public from the accidental  release of radioactive material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Potential impact on radiological exposure of facility employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Installation and continuing costs associated with the backfit,  including the cost of plant downtime;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The potential safety impact of changes in plant or operational  complexity, including the relationship to proposed and existing  regulatory requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The estimated resource burden on the NRC associated with the  proposed backfit and the availability of such resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The potential impact of differences in plant type, design, or  age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Whether the proposed backfit is interim or final and, if  interim, the justification for imposing the proposed backfit on an  interim basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No certificate will be withheld during the pendency of backfit  analyses required by the Commission's rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Executive Director for Operations shall be responsible for  implementation of this section, and all analyses required by this  section shall be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or  his or her designee.
