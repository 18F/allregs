                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Listed species and critical habitat have the same meaning as  provided in 50 CFR 402.02.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Project area means any area subject to construction activities  (for example, material storage sites, temporary work areas, and new  access roads) necessary to install or abandon the facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for informal consultation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designation of non- Federal representative. The project sponsor is designated as the  Commission's non-Federal representative for purposes of informal  consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the  National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Endangered Species  Act of 1973, as amended (ESA).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consultation requirement. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the filing of the  environmental report specified in Sec. 380.12, the project sponsor must  contact the appropriate regional or field office of the FWS or the NMFS,  or both if appropriate, to initiate informal consultations, unless it is  proceeding pursuant to a blanket clearance issued by the FWS and/or NMFS  which is less than 1 year old and the clearance does not specify more  frequent consultation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a blanket clearance is more than 1 year old or less than 1  year old and specifies more frequent consultations, or if the project  sponsor is not proceeding pursuant to a blanket clearance, the project  sponsor must request a list of federally listed or proposed species and  designated or proposed critical habitat that may be present in the  project area, or provide the consulted agency with such a list for its  concurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The consulted agency will provide a species and critical  habitat list or concur with the species list provided within 30 days of  its receipt of the initial request. In the event that the consulted  agency does not provide this information within this time period, the  project sponsor may notify the Director of the Office of Energy Projects  and continue with the remaining procedures of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> End of informal consultation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At any time during the  informal consultations, the consulted agency may determine or confirm:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That no listed or proposed species, or designated or proposed  critical habitat, occurs in the project area; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That the project is not likely to adversely affect a listed  species or critical habitat;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the consulted agency provides the determination or  confirmation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, no  further consultation is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Potential impact to proposed species. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the consulted  agency, pursuant to informal consultations, initially determines that  any species proposed to be listed, or proposed critical habitat, occurs  in the project area, the project sponsor must confer with the consulted  agency on methods to avoid or reduce the potential impact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project sponsor shall include in its proposal, a discussion  of any mitigating measures recommended through the consultation process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Continued informal consultations for listed species. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the  consulted agency initially determines, pursuant to the informal  consultations, that a listed species or designated critical habitat may  occur in the project area, the project sponsor must continue informal  consultations with the consulted agency to determine if the proposed  project may affect the species or designated critical habitat. These  consultations may include discussions with experts (including experts  provided by the consulted agency), habitat identification, field  surveys, biological analyses, and the formulation of mitigation  measures. If the provided information indicates that the project is not  likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat, the  consulting agency will provide a letter of concurrence which completes  informal consultation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project sponsor must prepare a Biological Assessment unless  the consulted agency indicates that the proposed project is not likely  to adversely affect a specific listed species or its designated critical  habitat. The Biological Assessment must contain the following  information for each species contained in the consulted agency's species  list:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Life history and habitat requirements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Results of detailed surveys to determine if individuals,  populations, or suitable, unoccupied habitat exists in the proposed  project's area of effect;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Potential impacts, both beneficial and negative, that could  result from the construction and operation of the proposed project, or  disturbance associated with the abandonment, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Proposed mitigation that would eliminate or minimize these  potential impacts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All surveys must be conducted by qualified biologists and must  use FWS and/or NMFS approved survey methodology. In addition, the  Biological Assessment must include the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Name(s) and qualifications of person(s) conducting the survey;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Survey methodology;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Date of survey(s); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Detailed and site-specific identification of size and location  of all areas surveyed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The project sponsor must provide a draft Biological Assessment  directly to the environmental staff of the Office of Energy Projects for  review and comment and/or submission to the consulted agency. If the  consulted agency fails to provide formal comments on the Biological  Assessment to the project sponsor within 30 days of its receipt, as  specified in 50 CFR 402.120, the project sponsor may notify the  Director, OEP, and follow the procedures in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The consulted agency's comments on the Biological Assessment's  determination must be filed with the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification to Director. In the event that the consulted agency  fails to respond to requests by the project sponsor under paragraph (b)  of this section, the project sponsor must notify the Director of the  Office of Energy Projects. The notification must include all  information, reports, letters, and other correspondence prepared  pursuant to this section. The Director will determine whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additional informal consultation is required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Formal consultation must be initiated under paragraph (d) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction may proceed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for formal consultation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event that formal  consultation is required pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(v) or (c)(2) of  this section, the Commission staff will initiate formal consultation  with the FWS and/or NMFS, as appropriate, and will request that the  consulted agency designate a lead Regional Office, lead Field/District  Office, and Project Manager, as necessary, to facilitate the formal  consultation process. In addition, the Commission will designate a  contact for formal consultation purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During formal consultation, the consulted agency, the  Commission, and the project sponsor will coordinate and consult to  determine potential impacts and mitigation which can be implemented to  minimize impacts. The Commission and the consulted agency will schedule  coordination meetings and/or field visits as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The formal consultation period will last no longer than 90 days,  unless the consulted agency, the Commission, and project sponsor  mutually agree to an extension of this time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The consulted agency will provide the Commission with a  Biological Opinion on the proposed project, as specified in 50 CFR  402.14(e), within 45 days of the completion of formal consultation.
