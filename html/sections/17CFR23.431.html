The mid-market mark of the swap shall not include  amounts for profit, credit reserve, hedging, funding, liquidity, or any  other costs or adjustments. The daily mark shall be provided to the  counterparty during the term of the swap as of the close of business or  such other time as the parties agree in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For uncleared swaps, disclose to the counterparty:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The methodology and assumptions used to prepare the daily mark  and any material changes during the term of the swap; provided however,  that the swap dealer or major swap participant is not required to  disclose to the counterparty confidential, proprietary information about  any model it may use to prepare the daily mark; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional information concerning the daily mark to ensure a  fair and balanced communication, including, as appropriate, that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The daily mark may not necessarily be a price at which either  the counterparty or the swap dealer or major swap participant would  agree to replace or terminate the swap;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Depending upon the agreement of the parties, calls for margin  may be based on considerations other than the daily mark provided to the  counterparty; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The daily mark may not necessarily be the value of the swap that  is marked on the books of the swap dealer or major swap participant.</p>
