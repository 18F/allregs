                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transfers of funds; registration and reporting required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Who  may make transfers under this section. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transfers of funds may be  made without limit on amount between affiliated committees whether or  not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to the restrictions set forth at 11 CFR 300.10(a),  300.31 and 300.34(a) and (b), transfers of funds may be made without  limit on amount between or among a national party committee, a State  party committee and/or any subordinate party committee whether or not  they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5 and whether or not such  committees are affiliated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Transfers of joint fundraising proceeds may be made without  limit on amount between organizations or committees participating in the  joint fundraising activity provided that no participating committee or  organization governed by 11 CFR 102.17 received more than its allocated  share of the funds raised.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Transfers under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) shall be  made only from funds which are permissible under the Act. See 11 CFR  parts 110, 114 and 115.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When registration and reporting required. Except as provided in  11 CFR 102.6(b), organizations or committees making transfers under 11  CFR 102.6(a)(1) shall count such transfers against the reporting  thresholds of the Act for determining whether an organization or  committee is a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fundraising by collecting agents; No reporting required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Definition of collecting agent. A collecting agent is an organization or  committee that collects and transmits contributions to one or more  separate segregated funds to which the collecting agent is related. A  collecting agent may be either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A committee, whether or not it is a political committee as  defined in 11 CFR 100.5, affiliated with the separate segregated fund  under 11 CFR 110.3; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The connected organization of the separate segregated fund as  defined in 11 CFR 100.6; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A parent, subsidiary, branch, division, department, or local  unit of the connected organization of the separate segregated fund; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A local, national or international union collecting  contributions on behalf of the separate segregated fund of any  federation with which the local, national or international union is  affiliated. See 11 CFR 114.1(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Collecting agent not required to report. A collecting agent that  is an unregistered organization and that follows the procedures of 11  CFR 102.6(c) is not required to register and report as a political  committee under 11 CFR parts 102 and 104, provided that the organization  does not engage in other activities such as making contributions or  expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal elections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Who is not a collecting agent--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial fundraising firm.  A separate segregated fund or a collecting agent may hire a commercial  fundraising firm to assist in fundraising; however, the commercial  fundraising firm shall not be considered as a collecting agent for the  purpose of this section. Rather, the commercial fundraising firm shall  be considered to be the agent of the separate segregated fund or  collecting agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals. An individual who collects contributions for a  separate segregated fund shall not be considered a collecting agent for  the purpose of this section. Individuals who collect contributions are  subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 and the provisions of 11 CFR  part 110.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Separate segregated fund may collect contributions. Nothing in  this section shall preclude a separate segregated fund from soliciting  and collecting contributions on its own behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for collecting agents--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Separate segregated fund  responsible for acts of collecting agent. The separate segregated fund  shall be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping, reporting and  transmittal requirements of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Solicitation for contributions. A collecting agent may include a  solicitation for voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund  in a bill for membership dues or other payments such as conference  registration fees or a solicitation for contributions to the collecting  agent. The collecting agent may only solicit contributions from those  persons permitted to be solicited under 11 CFR part 114. The  solicitation for contributions must meet all of the requirements for  proper solicitations under 11 CFR 114.5.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The collecting agent may pay any or all of the costs incurred in  soliciting and transmitting contributions to the separate segregated  fund.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other  administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid  for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting  agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30  calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated  fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Checks combining contributions with other payments. A  contributor may write a check that represents both a contribution and  payment of dues or other fees. The check must be drawn on the  contributor's personal checking account or on a non-repayable corporate  drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction  plan, an employer may write a check on behalf of its employees to a  union or its agent, which check represents a combined payment of  voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and  union dues or other employee deductions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transmittal of contributions. The full amount of each  contribution collected by a collecting agent on behalf of a separate  segregated fund shall be   transmitted to that fund within 10 or 30 days as required by 11 CFR  102.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Checks made payable to the separate segregated fund shall be  transmitted by the collecting agent directly to the separate segregated  fund in accordance with 11 CFR 102.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To transfer all other contributions, a collecting agent shall  either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish a transmittal account to be used solely for the  deposit and transmittal of funds collected on behalf of the separate  segregated fund. Funds deposited into this account are subject to the  prohibitions and limitations of the Act. If any expenditure is made from  the account, other than a transfer of funds to an affiliated committee,  the account shall be considered a depository of the recipient committee  and all activity of that account shall be reported; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Deposit the contributions collected into the collecting agent's  treasury account. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of  all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate  segregated fund and, in the case of cash contributions, the collecting  agent shall make separate deposits of such funds; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Deposit the contributions collected into an account otherwise  established solely for State or local election activity. The collecting  agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that  represent contributions to the separate segregated fund; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In the case of cash contributions, transmit the contributions to  the separate segregated fund in the form of money orders or cashier's  checks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contributor information. The collecting agent shall comply with  the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 regarding transmittal of contributions  and contributor information to the separate segregated fund, except that  if contributions of $50 or less are received at a mass collection, a  record shall be kept of the date, the total amount collected, and the  name of the function at which the collection was made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Retention of records. The collecting agent shall retain all  records of contribution deposits and transmittals under this section for  a period of three years and shall make these records available to the  Commission on request. The separate segregated fund shall keep a record  of all transmittals of contributions received from collecting agents  under this section, and shall retain these records for a period of three  years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reporting of funds received through collecting agents. A  separate segregated fund receiving contributions collected by a  collecting agent shall report the full amount of each contribution  received as a contribution from the original contributor to the extent  required by 11 CFR 104.3(a).
