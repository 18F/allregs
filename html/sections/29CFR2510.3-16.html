                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The term ``plan administrator'' or ``administrator'' means the person specifically so designated by the terms of the instrument under which the plan is operated. If an administrator is not so designated, the plan administrator is the plan sponsor, as defined in section 3(16)(B) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a self-insured group health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, as defined in Sec. 2590.715-2713A(a) of this chapter, if the eligible organization provides a copy of the self-certification of its objection to administering or funding any contraceptive benefits in accordance with Sec. 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter to a third party administrator, the self-certification shall be an instrument under which the plan is operated, shall be treated as a designation of the third party administrator as the plan administrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contraceptive services required to be covered under Sec. 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter to which the eligible organization objects on religious grounds, and shall supersede any earlier designation. If, instead, the eligible organization notifies the Secretary of Health and Human Services of its objection to administering or funding any contraceptive benefits in accordance with Sec. 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter, the Department of Labor, working with the Department of Health and Human Services, shall separately provide notification to each third party administrator that such third party administrator shall be the plan administrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contraceptive services required to be covered under Sec. 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter to which the eligible organization objects on religious grounds, with respect to benefits for contraceptive services that the third party administrator would otherwise manage. Such notification from the Department of Labor shall be an instrument under which the plan is operated and shall supersede any earlier designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A third party administrator that becomes a plan administrator pursuant to this section shall be responsible for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complying with section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-13) (as incorporated into section 715 of ERISA) and Sec. 2590.715-2713 of this chapter with respect to coverage of contraceptive services. To the extent the plan contracts with different third party administrators for different classifications of benefits (such as prescription drug benefits versus inpatient and outpatient benefits), each third party administrator is responsible for providing contraceptive coverage that complies with section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (as incorporated into section 715 of ERISA) and Sec. 2590.715-2713 of this chapter with respect to the classification or classifications of benefits subject to its contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establishing and operating a procedure for determining such claims for contraceptive services in accordance with Sec. 2560.503-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Complying with disclosure and other requirements applicable to group health plans under Title I of ERISA with respect to such benefits.
