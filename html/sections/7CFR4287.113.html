The appraisal will be at the expense of the borrower and must meet the requirements of Sec. 4279.144 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. The remaining collateral must be sufficient to provide for repayment of the Agency's guaranteed loan. The Agency may, at its discretion, require an appraisal of the remaining collateral in cases where it is determined that the Agency may be adversely affected by the release of collateral. Sale or release of collateral must be based on an arm's-length transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within the parameters of paragraph (a) of this section, lenders may, over the life of the loan, release collateral (other than personal and corporate guarantees) with a cumulative value of up to 20 percent of the original loan amount without Agency concurrence if the proceeds generated are used to reduce the guaranteed loan or to buy replacement collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within the parameters of paragraph (a) of this section, release of collateral with a cumulative value in excess of 20 percent of the original loan or when the proceeds will not be used to reduce the guaranteed loan or to buy replacement collateral must be requested in writing by the lender and concurred in by the Agency in writing in advance of the release. A written evaluation will be completed by the lender to justify the release.
