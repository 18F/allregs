                            <p class="depth0">The Sanctuary is comprised of six distinct units, forming a network  of marine protected areas around the islands of the Territory of  American Samoa. Tables containing the exact coordinates of each point  described below can be found in Appendix to Subpart J--National Marine  Sanctuary of American Samoa Boundary Coordinates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fagatele Bay Unit. The Fagatele Bay Unit is a 163-acre (0.25 sq.  mi.) coastal embayment formed by a collapsed volcanic crater on the  island of Tutuila, Territory of American Samoa, and includes Fagatele  Bay in its entirety. The landward boundary is defined by the mean high  high water line of Fagatele Bay until the point at which it intersects  the seaward boundary of the Sanctuary as defined by a straight line  between Fagatele Point (^14.36527, ^170.76932) and Steps Point  (^14.37291, ^170.76056) from the point at which it intersects the mean  high high water line seaward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fagalua/Fogama'a Unit. The landward boundary of the Fagalua/ Fogama'a Unit is defined by the mean high high water line of Fagalua/ Fogama'a until the point at which it intersects the seaward boundary of  the Fagalua/Fogama'a Unit as defined by a straight line between Steps  Point (^14.37307, ^170.75852) and Sail Rock Point (^14.36534,  ^170.74119) from the point at which it intersects the mean high high  water line seaward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Aunu'u Unit. The Aunu'u Unit is comprised of two adjacent zones.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Zone A. The Aunu'u Unit boundary for Zone A is defined by the  coordinates provided in Table 1 and the following textual description.  The Zone A boundary extends from Point 1, the northwest corner of the  unit, southward to Point 2 along a straight line following the western  boundary of the unit, which is aligned with Taugamalama Point on  Tutuila. It then extends northeastward in a multi-part line along the  deepest seaward edge of Nafanua Bank from Point 2 to Point 3 and then to  Point 4, which lies on the southern boundary of Zone B. The boundary  then follows a straight line westward towards Point 5 until it  intersects the mean high high water   line at the southern tip of Ma'ama'a Cove. The landward boundary of Zone  A is defined by the mean high high water line from this intersection  point at the southern tip of Ma'ama'a Cove to the intersection of the  mean high high water line and the straight line between Point 6 and  Point 7 at Salevatia Point. From this intersection point at Salevatia  Point, the boundary extends straight west to Point 7, which has the  exact same coordinates as Point 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zone B. The Aunu'u Unit boundary for Zone B is defined by the  coordinates provided in Table 2 and the following textual description.  The Zone B boundary extends from Point 1, the northeast corner of the  unit, southward along a straight line following the eastern boundary of  the unit to Point 2, which is on the southern boundary of the unit. The  southern boundary then follows a line westward towards Point 3 until it  intersects the mean high high water line at the southern tip of Ma'ama'a  Cove Point. The landward boundary of Zone B is defined by the mean high  high water line from this intersection point at the southern tip of  Ma'ama'a Cove around the volcanic crater to the intersection of the mean  high high water line and the straight line between Point 4 and Point 5.  From here, the boundary extends seaward straight north to Point 5. The  northern border, the last straight line, is defined by connecting Point  5 and Point 6, along the northern boundary of the unit, which is aligned  with Matuli Point on Tutuila. Point 6 has the exact same coordinates at  Point 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Swains Island Unit. The Swains Island Unit boundary is defined  by the coordinates provided in Table 3 and the following textual  description. The landward boundary of the Swains Island Unit is the mean  high high water line. The seaward boundary of the Swains Island Unit is  the territorial water boundary 3 nautical miles from the mean high high  water line that surrounds the island. Within that area surrounding the  island, there are two areas excluded from the sanctuary boundaries. The  first excluded are extends from Point 1 along the mean high high water  line northward along the western coast of the island to Point 2. From  Point 2, the boundary extends offshore in a line perpendicular to the  coast to Point 3. From Point 3, the boundary extends south-southwest to  Point 4, and from Point 4 the boundary extends south-southeast to Point  5. From there, the boundary extends landward in a straight line to Point  6. The second excluded area extends from Point 7 along the mean high  high water line northeastward along the southeastern coast to Point 8.  From Point 8, the boundary extends offshore in a perpendicular line to  the coast to Point 9. From Point 9, the boundary extends south-southwest  to Point 10. From there, the boundary extends landward in a straight  line to Point 11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Muli[amacr]va Unit. The Muli[amacr]va Unit boundary is defined  by the coordinates provided in Table 4 and the following textual  description. The landward boundary of the Muli[amacr]va Unit is the  extreme low water line, which adjoins the boundary of the Rose Atoll  National Wildlife Refuge. The Muli[amacr]va Unit seaward boundary  extends from Point 1, the southwest corner of the unit, to Point 2 along  a straight line northward following the western boundary of the unit.  From Point 2, the line extends in a straight line westward to Point 3.  It then extends along a straight line northward to Point 4. From Point  4, the line extends in a straight line eastward to Point 5. From Point  5, the line extends along a straight line northward to Point 6. It then  extends along a straight line eastward from Point 6 to Point 7, which is  on the eastern boundary of the unit. The boundary then follows a  straight line southward until it intersects the line of the southern  boundary of the unit at Point 8, the southeastern corner of the unit.  The last straight line is defined by connecting Point 8 and Point 9,  which has the exact same coordinates as Point 1, along the southern  boundary of the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ta'u Unit. The Ta'u Unit boundary is defined by the coordinates  provided in Table 5 and the following textual description. The Ta'u Unit  boundary extends from Point 1, Vaita Point, along the mean high high  water line southward along the western coast to Point 2, Si'ufa'alele  Point. From Point 2, the boundary extends offshore 0.25 miles to   Point 3 to become conterminous with the offshore boundary of the  National Park of American Samoa. From Point 3 the boundary continues to  follow the coastline 0.25 miles offshore until it reaches Point 4, which  is directly south of Si'u Point. From Point 4, the boundary extends due  south to Point 5. From Point 5, the boundary extends due west to Point  6, forming the southern border of the unit. From Point 6, the boundary  extends due north until it reaches Point 7, directly west and one mile  offshore from Point 8, which is Point 1, also known as Vaita Point.</p>
