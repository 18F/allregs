                            <p class="depth0">This section covers relinquishing of patent title rights by the Government to a class of persons or to a class of inventions. The authorization for class waivers is to be found at 42 U.S.C. 5908(c). Class waivers may be appropriate in situations where all members of a particular class would likely qualify for an advance or identified invention waiver. Normally, class waivers are originated by the Department. However, any person with a direct and substantial interest in a DOE program may request a class waiver by forwarding a written request therefor to the Patent Counsel. While no particular format for requesting a class waiver is prescribed, any request for a class waiver and any resulting determination by the Secretary or designee must address the pertinent objectives and considerations set forth in Secs. 784.3(a), 784.4, 784.5, and 784.6.</p>
