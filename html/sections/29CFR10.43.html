As part of the investigation, the  Administrator may conduct interviews with the relevant contractor, as  well as the contractor's workers at the worksite during normal work  hours; inspect the relevant contractor's records (including contract  documents and payrolls, if applicable); make copies and transcriptions  of such records; and require the production of any documentary or other  evidence the Administrator deems necessary to determine whether a  violation, including conduct warranting imposition of debarment, has  occurred. Federal agencies and contractors shall cooperate with any  authorized representative of the Department of Labor in the inspection  of records, in interviews with workers, and in all aspects of  investigations.</p>
