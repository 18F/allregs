For an occurrence requiring immediate notification or reporting as required by applicable DOE Orders, rules, and regulations, the contractor will require testing as soon as possible after the occurrence but within 24 hours of the occurrence, unless DOE determines that it is not feasible to do so. For other occurrences requiring notifications to DOE as required by applicable DOE Orders, rules, and regulations, the contractor may require testing.</p>
