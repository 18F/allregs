                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All non-exempt materials shall be available for inspection  during normal business hours at the Commission offices, 1625 I Street,  NW., Room 307, Washington, DC. Space shall be made available at that  location for the use of any person who is granted permission to inspect  such materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests to inspect, and obtain copies of, any material  maintained by the Commission may be made in person at the Commission  offices, or submitted in writing to the Executive Director, Marine  Mammal Commission, 1625 I St., NW., Room 307, Washington, DC 20006. Each  request should include a reasonable description of the material being  sought, and should contain sufficient detail to facilitate retrieval of  the material without undue delay. The Commission staff shall assist to  the extent practicable in identifying material that is imprecisely  described by the person requesting such material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant  each request shall be made by the General Counsel or his delegate within  10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after  receipt of that request. The person making the request shall be notified  immediately of the determination made. In making such determinations, it  shall first be considered whether the material requested is of a type  described in Sec. 520.2(a); if it is, the request shall be granted  unless the material is exempted by Sec. 520.2(b). If the material  requested is not of a type described in Sec. 520.2(a), or is the  subject of one or more exemptions, the request shall be denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a determination is made to grant a request, the relevant  material shall promptly be made available for inspection at the  Commission offices. Copies of the material disclosed shall be furnished  within a reasonable time after payment of the fee specified in Sec.  520.7. Copies of less than 10 pages of material requested in person  ordinarily will be furnished immediately following the determination to  grant the request and payment of the fee. Larger numbers of copies may  be furnished at the earliest convenience of the Commission staff, but  must be furnished within a reasonable time following payment of the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whenever required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of  personal privacy, the General Counsel or his delegate shall determine  that identifying details shall be deleted from an opinion, statement of  policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction to which access  is granted or of which copies are furnished. Where portions of the  requested material are exempt under Sec. 520.2(b), and are reasonably  segregable from the remainder of the material, those portions shall be  excised from the material disclosed. Whenever details are deleted or  portions are excised and not disclosed, the notification shall include  the information specified in Sec. 520.4(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a determination is made to deny a request, the notification  shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, shall set  forth the name and position of the person responsible for the denial,  and shall advise the requester of the right, and the procedures required  under Sec. 520.5, to appeal the denial to the Director.</p>
