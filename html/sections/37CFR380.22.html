                                Sec.  380.22  Royalty fees for the public performance of sound

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minimum fee. Each Noncommercial Educational Webcaster shall pay an annual, nonrefundable minimum fee of $500 (the ``Minimum Fee'') for each of its individual channels, including each of its individual side channels, and each of its individual stations, through which (in each case) it makes Eligible Transmissions, for each calendar year it makes Eligible Transmissions subject to this subpart. For clarity, each individual stream (e.g., HD radio side channels, different stations owned by a single licensee) will be treated separately and be subject to a separate minimum. In addition, a Noncommercial Educational Webcaster electing the reporting waiver described in Sec.  380.23(g)(1), shall pay a $100 annual fee (the ``Proxy Fee'') to the Collective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional usage fees. If, in any month, a Noncommercial Educational Webcaster makes total transmissions in excess of 159,140 Aggregate Tuning Hours on any individual channel or station, the Noncommercial Educational Webcaster shall pay additional usage fees (``Usage Fees'') for the Eligible Transmissions it makes on that channel or station after exceeding 159,140 total ATH at the following per-performance rates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 2011: $0.0017;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 2012: $0.0020;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 2013: $0.0022;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 2014: $0.0023;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 2015: $0.0025.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For a Noncommercial Educational Webcaster unable to calculate actual total performances and not required to report ATH or actual total performances under Sec.  380.23(g)(3), the Noncommercial Educational Webcaster may pay its Usage Fees on an ATH basis, provided that the Noncommercial Educational Webcaster shall pay its Usage Fees at the per-performance rates provided in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section based on the assumption that the number of sound recordings performed is 12 per hour. The Collective may distribute royalties paid on the basis of ATH hereunder in accordance with its generally applicable methodology for distributing royalties paid on such basis. In addition, and for the avoidance of doubt, a Noncommercial Educational Webcaster offering more than one channel or station shall pay Usage Fees on a per-channel or -station basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ephemeral royalty. The royalty payable under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) for any ephemeral reproductions made by a Noncommercial Educational Webcaster and covered by this subpart is deemed to be included within the royalty payments set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) through (5) of this section and to equal the percentage of such royalty payments determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges for other webcasting in Sec.  380.3.</p>
