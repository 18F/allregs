                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equity investments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prohibited investments. No insured state  savings association may directly acquire or retain as principal any  equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible  for a Federal savings association unless the exception in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception: Equity investment in service corporations. An insured  state savings association that is and continues to be in compliance with  the applicable capital standards as prescribed by the appropriate  Federal banking agency may acquire or retain an equity investment in a  service corporation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not permissible for a Federal savings association to the extent  the service corporation is engaging in activities that are allowed  pursuant to the provisions of or an application under Sec. 362.12(b); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Of a type permissible for a Federal savings association, but in  an amount exceeding the investment limits applicable to Federal savings  associations, if the insured state savings association obtains the  FDIC's prior consent. Consent will be given only if the FDIC determines  that the amount of the investment in a service corporation engaged in  such activities does not present a significant risk to the Deposit  Insurance Fund. Applications should be filed in accordance with  Sec. 303.141 of this chapter and will be processed under Sec. 303.142(b)  of this chapter. Approvals granted under Sec. 303.142(b) of this chapter  may be made subject to any conditions or restrictions found by the FDIC  to be necessary to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund from significant  risk, to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and/or to ensure that the  activity is consistent with the purposes of Federal deposit insurance  and other applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Activities other than equity investments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prohibited  activities. An insured state savings association may not directly engage  as principal in any activity, that is not an equity investment, of a  type not permissible for a Federal savings association, and an insured  state savings association shall not make nonresidential real property  loans in an amount exceeding that described in section 5(c)(2)(B) of  HOLA (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(2)(B)), unless one of the exceptions in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies. This section shall not be read  to require the divestiture of any asset (including a nonresidential real  estate loan), if the asset was acquired prior to August 9, 1989;  however, any activity conducted with such asset must be conducted in  accordance with this subpart. On and after July 21, 2012, an insured  savings association directly or through a subsidiary (other than, in the  case of a mutual savings association, a subsidiary that is a qualified  affiliate), shall not acquire or retain a corporate debt security unless  the savings association, prior to acquiring the security and  periodically thereafter, determines that the issuer of the security has  adequate capacity to meet all   financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the  security. Saving associations have until January 1, 2013 to come into  compliance with this treatment of corporate debt securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consent obtained through application. An insured  state savings association that meets and continues to meet the  applicable capital standards set by the appropriate Federal banking  agency may directly conduct activities prohibited by paragraph (b)(1) of  this section if the savings association obtains the FDIC's prior  consent. Consent will be given only if the FDIC determines that  conducting the activity designated poses no significant risk to the  Deposit Insurance Fund. Applications should be filed in accordance with  Sec. 303.141 of this chapter and will be processed under Sec. 303.142(b)  of this chapter. Approvals granted under Sec. 303.142(b) of this chapter  may be made subject to any conditions or restrictions found by the FDIC  to be necessary to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund from significant  risk, to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and/or to ensure that the  activity is consistent with the purposes of Federal deposit insurance  and other applicable law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonresidential realty loans permissible for a Federal savings  association conducted in an amount not permissible. An insured state  savings association that meets and continues to meet the applicable  capital standards set by the appropriate Federal banking agency may make  nonresidential real property loans in an amount exceeding the amount  described in section 5(c)(2)(B) of HOLA, if the savings association  files a notice in compliance with Sec. 303.141 of this chapter and the  FDIC processes the notice without objection under Sec. 303.142(a) of  this chapter. Consent will be given only if the FDIC determines that  engaging in such lending in the amount designated poses no significant  risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Acquiring and retaining adjustable rate and money market  preferred stock. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An insured state savings association's investment  of up to 15 percent of the association's tier one capital in adjustable  rate preferred stock or money market (auction rate) preferred stock does  not represent a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. An  insured state savings association may conduct this activity without  first obtaining the FDIC's consent, provided that the association meets  and continues to meet the applicable capital standards as prescribed by  the appropriate Federal banking agency. The fact that prior consent is  not required by this subpart does not preclude the FDIC from taking any  appropriate action with respect to the activities if the facts and  circumstances warrant such action.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An insured state savings association may acquire or retain other  instruments of a type determined by the FDIC to have the character of  debt securities and not to represent a significant risk to the Deposit  Insurance Fund. Such instruments shall be included in the 15 percent of  tier one capital limit imposed in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this  section. An insured state savings association may conduct this activity  without first obtaining the FDIC's consent, provided that the  association meets and continues to meet the applicable capital standards  as prescribed by the appropriate Federal banking agency. The fact that  prior consent is not required by this subpart does not preclude the FDIC  from taking any appropriate action with respect to the activities if the  facts and circumstances warrant such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Activities permissible for a Federal savings association  conducted in an amount not permissible. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section, an insured state savings association may  engage as principal in any activity, which is not an equity investment  of a type permissible for a Federal savings association, in an amount in  excess of that permissible for a Federal savings association, if the  savings association meets and continues to meet the applicable capital  standards set by the appropriate Federal banking agency, the institution  has advised the appropriate regional director (DSC) under the procedure  in Sec. 303.142(c) of this chapter within thirty days before engaging in  the activity, and the FDIC   has not advised the insured state savings association that conducting  the activity in the amount indicated poses a significant risk to the  Deposit Insurance Fund. This section shall not be read to require the  divestiture of any asset if the asset was acquired prior to August 9,  1989; however, any activity conducted with such asset must be conducted  in accordance with this subpart.
