                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. SBA may enter into written agreements to accept the EDWOSB or WOSB certification of a Federal agency, State government, or national certifying entity if SBA determines that the entity's certification process complies with SBA-approved certification standards and tracks the EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility requirements set forth in subpart B of this part. The written agreement will include a provision authorizing SBA to terminate the agreement if SBA subsequently determines that the entity's certification process does not comply with SBA-approved certification standards or is not based on the same EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility requirements as set forth in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required certification standards. In order for SBA to enter into an agreement to accept the EDWOSB or WOSB certification of a Federal agency, State government, or national certifying entity, the entity must establish the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It will render fair and impartial EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It will retain the documents submitted by the approved WOSB or EDWOSB for a period of six (6) years from the date of certification (initial and any recertification) and provide any such documents to SBA in response to a status protest or eligibility examination or agency investigation or audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Its certification process will require applicant concerns to pre-register in SAM (or any successor system)and submit sufficient information as determined by SBA to enable it to determine whether the concern qualifies as an EDWOSB or WOSB. This information must include documentation demonstrating whether the concern is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A small business concern under SBA's size standards for its primary industry classification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are United States citizens; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a concern applying for EDWOSB certification, at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are United States citizens and economically disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It will not decline to accept a concern's application for EDWOSB or WOSB certification on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or marital or family status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> List of SBA-approved certifiers. SBA will maintain a list of approved certifiers, including certifiers from which SBA will accept DOT DBE certifications, on SBA's Internet Web site at http://www.sba.gov/GC. Any interested person may also obtain a copy of the list from the local SBA district office

or SBA Area Office for Government Contracting.
