                                Sec. 221.120  Grounds for approving or denying Special Tariff
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General authority. The Department may permit changes in fares,  charges or other tariff provisions on less than the statutory notice  required by section 41505 of the statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grounds for approval. The following facts and circumstances  constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special  Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances  warranting denial:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clerical or typographical errors. Clerical or typographical  errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for  Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the  tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for  Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify  the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts  and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the  Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective  tariff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or  unintelligibility. Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or  typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for  Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice,  effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected  tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors  corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission  based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a  complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and  such application shall be filed with the Department within five days  after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Newly authorized transportation. The fact that the Department  has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation  constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff  Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and  other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or  Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for  approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff  stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than  statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications  is set forth in Sec. 399.35 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Lowered fares and charges. The prospective lowering of fares or  charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an  application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory  notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules  affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the  application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of  lawfulness, as set forth in Sec. 399.35 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing notice required by formal order. When a formal order of  the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number  of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on  less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for  modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.</p>
