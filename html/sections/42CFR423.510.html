                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cause for termination. The Part D plan sponsor may terminate its  contract if CMS fails to substantially carry out the terms of the  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of termination. The Part D plan sponsor must give advance  notice as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To CMS, at least 90 days before the intended date of  termination. This notice must specify the reasons why the Part D sponsor  is requesting contract termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To its Medicare enrollees, at least 60 days before the  termination effective date. This notice must include a written  description of alternatives available for obtaining qualified  prescription drug coverage within the services area, including  alternative PDPs, MA-PDPs, and original Medicare and must receive CMS  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the general public, at least 60 days before the termination  effective date by publishing a CMS-approved notice in one or more  newspapers of general circulation in each community or county located in  the Part D plan sponsor's geographic area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date of termination. The effective date of the  termination is determined by CMS and is at least 90 days after the date  CMS receives the Part D plan sponsor's notice of intent to terminate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CMS's liability. CMS's liability for payment to the Part D plan  sponsor ends as of the first day of the month after the last month for  which the contract is in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of termination by the organization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS does not  enter into an agreement with an organization that has terminated its  contract within the preceding 2 years unless there are circumstances  that warrant special consideration, as determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the same 2-year period specified in (e)(1) of this  section, CMS   will not contract with an organization whose covered persons also served  as covered persons for the terminating sponsor. A ``covered person'' as  used in this paragraph means one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All owners of nonrenewed or terminated organizations who are  natural persons, other than shareholders who have an ownership interest  of less than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An owner of a whole or part interest in a mortgage, deed of  trust, note or other obligation secured (in whole or in part) by the  organization, or any of the property or assets thereof, which whole or  part interest is equal to or exceeds 5 percent of the total property and  assets of the organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A member of the board of directors or board of trustees of the  entity, if the organization is organized as a corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Timely transfer of data and files. If a contract is terminated  under paragraph (a) of this section, the Part D plan sponsor must ensure  the timely transfer of any data or files.
