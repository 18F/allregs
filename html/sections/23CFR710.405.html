                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FHWA policies relating to management of airspace on the Interstate for non-highway purposes are included in this section. Although this section deals specifically with approval actions on the Interstate, any use of airspace contemplated by a STD must assure that such occupancy, use, or reservation is in the public interest and does not impair the highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic as provided in 23 CFR 1.23.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart applies to Interstate facilities which received title 23 of the

United States Code assistance in any way.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart does not apply to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-Interstate highways.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Railroads and public utilities which cross or otherwise occupy Federal-aid highway right-of-way.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Relocations of railroads or utilities for which reimbursement is claimed under 23 CFR part 140, subparts E and H.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Bikeways and pedestrian walkways as covered in 23 CFR part 652.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A STD may grant rights for temporary or permanent occupancy or use of Interstate system airspace if the STD has acquired sufficient legal right, title, and interest in the right-of-way of a federally assisted highway to permit the use of certain airspace for non-highway purposes; and where such airspace is not required presently or in the foreseeable future for the safe and proper operation and maintenance of the highway facility. The STD must obtain prior FHWA approval, except for paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An STD may make lands and rights-of-way available without charge to a publicly owned mass transit authority for public transit purposes whenever the public interest will be served, and where this can be accomplished without impairing automotive safety or future highway improvements</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An individual, company, organization, or public agency desiring to use airspace shall submit a written request to the STD. If the STD recommends approval, it shall forward an application together with its recommendation and any necessary supplemental information including the proposed airspace agreement to the FHWA. The submission shall affirmatively provide for adherence to all policy requirements contained in this subpart and conform to the provisions in the FHWA's Airspace Guidelines at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/index.htm.</p>
