To the extent practical, the requirements of the program will be met by merging IRS requirements into the Department's overall requirements for delinquent debt collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The debts of individuals of $100 or more will be reported to a consumer credit reporting agency before referral for tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debts owed by individuals will be screened for salary and administrative offset potential using the most current information reasonably available to

the Department, and will not be referred for tax refund offset where such other offset potential is found to exist.
