The notice shall be issued in sufficient time to provide the representative a reasonable time to review the material and submit advisory recommendations to the contracting officer. Failure of the representative to respond in a reasonable period of time shall not delay contract award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine any fee that may be payable if an incentive is used in conjunction with the subcontracting plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ensure that an acceptable plan is incorporated into and made a material part of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Letter contracts and similar undefinitized instruments, which would otherwise meet the requirements of 19.702(a)(1) and (2), shall contain at least a preliminary basic plan addressing the requirements of 19.704 and in such cases require the negotiation of the final plan within 90 days after award or before definitization, whichever occurs first.
