                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contingency plan must describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with Secs. 265.51 and 265.56 in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the owner or operator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with Part 112 of this chapter, or some other emergency or contingency plan, he need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the requirements of this Part. The owner or operator may develop one contingency plan which meets all regulatory requirements. EPA recommends that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (``One Plan''). When modifications are made to non-RCRA provisions in an integrated contingency plan, the changes do not trigger the need for a RCRA permit modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan must describe arrangements agreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local e mer gen cy response teams to coordinate emergency services, pursuant to Sec. 265.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The plan must list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see Sec. 265.55), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The plan must include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).
