                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. The Board may not approve any application under this subpart if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transaction would result in a monopoly or would further any combination or conspiracy to monopolize, or to attempt to monopolize, the savings and loan business in any part of the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen competition in any section of the country, tend to create a monopoly, or in any other manner be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that the transaction's anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed by its probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant has failed to provide the Board with adequate assurances that it will make available such information on its operations or activities, and the operations or activities of any affiliate of the applicant, that the Board deems appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with HOLA and other applicable federal banking statutes, and any regulations thereunder; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of an application involving a foreign banking organization, the foreign banking organization is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country, as provided in Sec. 211.24(c)(1)(ii) of the Board's Regulation K (12 CFR 211.24(c)(1)(ii)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of an application by a savings and loan holding company to acquire an insured depository institution, section 10(e)(2)(E) of HOLA prohibits the Board from approving the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other factors. In deciding applications under this subpart, the Board also considers the following factors with respect to the acquiror, its subsidiaries, any savings associations or banks related to the acquiror through common ownership or management, and the savings association or associations to be acquired:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial condition. Their financial condition and future prospects, including whether current and projected capital positions and levels of indebtedness conform to standards and policies established by the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Managerial resources. The competence, experience, and integrity of the officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the acquiror, its subsidiaries, and the savings association and savings and loan holding companies concerned; their record of compliance with laws and regulations; and the record of the applicant and its affiliates of fulfilling any commitments to, and any conditions imposed by, the Board in connection with prior applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Convenience and needs of community. In the case of an application required under Sec. 238.11(c), (d), or (e), (or an application by a savings and loan holding company under Sec. 238.11(b)), the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) and regulations issued thereunder, including the Board's Regulation BB (12 CFR part 228).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presumptive disqualifiers--(1) Integrity factors. The following factors shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that an acquiror may fail to satisfy the managerial resources and future prospects tests of paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Integrity factors. The following factors shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that an acquiror may fail to satisfy the managerial resources and future prospects tests of paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the 10-year period immediately preceding filing of the application or notice, criminal, civil or administrative judgments, consents or orders, and any indictments, formal investigations, examinations, or civil or administrative proceedings (excluding routine or customary audits, inspections and investigations) that terminated in any agreements, undertakings, consents or orders, issued against, entered into by, or involving the acquiror or affiliates of the acquiror by any federal or state court, any department, agency, or commission of the U.S. Government, any state or municipality, any Federal Home Loan Bank, any self-regulatory trade or professional organization, or any foreign government or governmental entity, which involve:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fraud, moral turpitude, dishonesty, breach of trust or fiduciary duties, organized crime or racketeering;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Violation of securities or commodities laws or regulations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Violation of depository institution laws or regulations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Violation of housing authority laws or regulations; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Violation of the rules, regulations, codes of conduct or ethics of a self-regulatory trade or professional organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Denial, or withdrawal after receipt of formal or informal notice of an intent to deny, by the acquiror or affiliates of the acquiror, of</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any application relating to the organization of a financial institution,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An application to acquire any financial institution or holding company thereof under HOLA or the Bank Holding Company Act or otherwise,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A notice relating to a change in control of any of the foregoing under the CIC Act; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An application or notice under a state holding company or change in control statute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The acquiror or affiliates of the acquiror were placed in receivership or conservatorship during the preceding 10 years, or any management official of the acquiror was a management official or director (other than an official or director serving at the request of the Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or their predecessors) or principal shareholder of a company or savings association that was placed into receivership, conservatorship, or a management consignment program, or was liquidated during his or her tenure or control or within two years thereafter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Felony conviction of the acquiror, an affiliate of the acquiror or a management official of the acquiror or an affiliate of the acquiror;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Knowingly making any written or oral statement to the Board or any predecessor agency (or its delegate) in connection with an application, notice or other filing under this part that is false or misleading with respect to a material fact or omits to state a material fact with respect to information furnished or requested in connection with such an application, notice or other filing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Acquisition and retention at the time of submission of an application or notice, of stock in the savings association by the acquiror in violation of this part or its predecessor regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial factors. The following shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that an acquiror may fail to satisfy the financial-resources and future-prospects tests of paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Liability for amounts of debt which, in the opinion of the Board, create excessive risks of default and pressure on the savings association to be acquired; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to furnish a business plan or furnishing a business plan projecting activities which are inconsistent with economical home financing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Competitive factor. Before approving any such acquisition, except a transaction under section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Board shall consider any report rendered by the Attorney General within 30 days of such request under Sec. 238.14(f) on the competitive factors involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited reorganizations. An application by a savings association solely for the purpose of obtaining approval for the creation of a savings and loan holding company by such savings

association shall be eligible for expedited processing under Sec. 238.14(g)(4) if it satisfies the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The holding company shall not be capitalized initially in an amount exceeding the amount the savings association is permitted to pay in dividends to its holding company as of the date of the reorganization pursuant to applicable regulations or, in the absence thereof, pursuant to the then current policy guidelines;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The creation of the savings and loan holding company by the association is the sole transaction contained in the application, and there are no other transactions requiring approval incident to the creation of the holding company (other than the creation of an interim association that will disappear upon consummation of the reorganization and the merger of the savings association with such interim association to effect the reorganization), and the holding company is not also seeking any regulatory waivers, regulatory forbearances, or resolution of legal or supervisory issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The board of directors and executive officers of the holding company are composed of persons who, at the time of acquisition, are executive officers and directors of the association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The acquisition raises no significant issues of law or policy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior to consummation of the reorganization transaction, the holding company shall enter into any dividend limitation, regulatory capital maintenance, or prenuptial agreement required by Board regulations, or in the absence thereof, required pursuant to policy guidelines issued by the Board; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Conditional approvals. The Board may impose conditions on any approval, including conditions to address competitive, financial, managerial, safety and soundness, convenience and needs, compliance or other concerns, to ensure that approval is consistent with the relevant statutory factors and other provisions of HOLA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No acquisition shall be approved by the Board pursuant to Sec. 238.11 which would result in the formation by any company, through one or more subsidiaries or through one or more transactions, of a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state where the acquisition causes a savings association to become an affiliate of another savings association with which it was not previously affiliated unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such company, or a savings association subsidiary of such company, is authorized to acquire control of a savings association subsidiary, or to operate a home or branch office, in the additional state or states pursuant to section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(k) (or section 408(m) of the National Housing Act as in effect immediately prior to enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such company controls a savings association subsidiary which operated a home or branch office in the additional state or states as of March 5, 1987; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The statute laws of the state in which the savings association, control of which is to be acquired, is located are such that a savings association chartered by such state could be acquired by a savings association chartered by the state where the acquiring savings association or savings and loan holding company is located (or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered savings association), and such statute laws specifically authorize such an acquisition by language to that effect and not merely by implication.</p>
