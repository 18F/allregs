The compensation committee must identify the features in the TARP recipient's SEO compensation plans that could lead SEOs to take these risks and the features in the employee compensation plans that pose risks to the TARP recipient, including any features in the SEO compensation plans and the employee compensation plans that would encourage behavior focused on short-term results and not on long-term value creation. The compensation committed is required to limit these features to ensure that the SEOs are not encouraged to take risks that are unnecessary or excessive and that the TARP recipient is not unnecessarily exposed to risks.</p>
