or title to a diesel fuel additive that is subject to the provisions of Sec. 80.521 to a party in the additive distribution system or in the diesel fuel distribution system for use downstream of the diesel fuel refiner, the transferor must provide to the transferee documents which identify the additive, and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the name and address of the transferor and transferee; the date of transfer; the location at which the transfer took place; the volume of additive transferred; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indicate compliance with the 15 ppm sulfur standard by inclusion of the following statement: ``The sulfur content of this diesel fuel additive does not exceed 15 ppm.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On each occasion that any person transfers custody or title to a diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of Sec. 80.521(b), to a party in the additive distribution system or in the diesel fuel distribution system for use in diesel fuel downstream of the diesel fuel refiner, the transferor must provide to the transferee documents which identify the additive, and do each of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the name and address of the transferor and transferee; the date of transfer; the location at which the transfer took place; the volume of additive transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indicate the high sulfur potential of the additive by inclusion of the following statement:</p><p class="depth3">This diesel fuel additive may exceed the federal 15 ppm sulfur standard.
