(a) Dosage must be adjusted to meet the changing needs of the individual animal. In mild and responsive cases, it is suggested that a dose of 5 milligrams per pound of body weight be administered two or three times daily. In moderately edematous and moderately responsive animals, a

dose of 7.5 to 10 milligrams per pound of body weight may be administered three times daily. Severe conditions may require higher doses. Certain animals may respond adequately to intermittent therapy; in these cases, the drug may be administered either every other day or for 3 to 5 days each week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Animals should be regularly and carefully observed for early signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Take appropriate countermeasures if this should occur. In some dogs, hypochloremic alkalosis may occur (that is, excretion of chloride in relation to sodium is excessive; the plasma bicarbonate level increases and alkalosis results). Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Specifications.
