                                Sec. 779.101  Guiding principles for applying coverage and exemption
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">It is clear that Congress intended the Fair Labor Standards Act to  be broad in its scope. ``Breadth of coverage is vital to its mission.''  (Powell v. U.S. Cartridge Co., 339 U.S. 497.) An employer who claims an  exemption under the Act has the burden of showing that it applies.  (Walling v. General Industries Co., 330 U.S. 545; Mitchell v. Kentucky  Finance Co., 359 U.S. 290; Fleming v. Hawkeye Pearl Button Co., 113 F.  2d 52.) Conditions specified in the language of the Act are ``explicit  prerequisites to exemption.'' (Arnold v. Kanowsky, 361 U.S. 388.) ``The  details with which the exemptions in this Act have been made preclude  their enlargement by implication.'' (Addison v. Holly Hill, 322 U.S. 60;  Maneja v. Waialua, 349 U.S. 254.) Exemptions provided in the Act ``are  to be narrowly construed against the employer seeking to assert them''  and their application limited to those who come plainly and unmistakably  within their terms and spirit; this restricted or narrow construction of  the exemptions is necessary to carry out the broad objectives for which  the Act was passed. (Phillips v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490; Mitchell v.  Kentucky Finance Co., supra; Arnold v. Kanowsky, supra; Calaf v.  Gonzalez, 127 F. 2d 934; Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11; Mitchell v.  Stinson, 217 F. 2d 210; Fleming v. Hawkeye Pearl Button Co., 113 F. 2d  52.)</p>
