                            <p class="depth0">A vessel is presumed to survive assumed damage if it meets the following conditions in the final stage of flooding:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Final waterline. The final waterline, in the final condition of sinkage, heel, and trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or an opening that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This opening does not include an opening closed by a--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Watertight manhole cover;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flush scuttle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Small watertight cargo tank hatch cover that maintains the high integrity of the deck;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A Class 1 door in a watertight bulkhead within the superstructure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Remotely operated sliding watertight door; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A side scuttle of the non-opening type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Heel angle. The maximum angle of heel must not exceed 30 degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Range of stability. Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its position of equilibrium after flooding, a tankship must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The righting arm curve must be positive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum righting arm must be at least 3.94 inches (10 cm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each submerged opening must be weathertight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Progressive flooding. If pipes, ducts, or tunnels are within the assumed extent of damage, arrangements must be made to prevent progressive flooding to a space that is not assumed to be flooded in the damaged stability calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Buoyancy of superstructure. The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Metacentric height. After flooding, the tank ship's metacentric height must be at least 2 inches (50 mm) when the vessel is in the upright position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Equalization arrangements. Equalization arrangements requiring mechanical aids such as valves or cross-flooding lines may not be considered for reducing the angle of heel. Spaces joined by ducts of large cross-sectional area are treated as common spaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Intermediate stages of flooding. If an intermediate stage of flooding is more critical than the final stage, the tank vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the requirements in this section in the intermediate stage.</p>
