                                Sec. 1.985-7  Adjustments required in connection with a change
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>. The application  of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A calendar year QBU that has not previously used DASTM  operates in a country in which the functional currency of the country is  hyperinflationary as defined under Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) for the  QBU's 1999 tax year. The look-back period is the period from January 1,  1996 through December 31, 1998, the transition date is December 31,  1995, and the taxable year of change is the taxable year beginning  January 1, 1999.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. A QBU that has not previously used DASTM with a taxable  year ending June 30, operates in a country in which the functional  currency of the country is hyperinflationary for the QBU's tax year  beginning July 1, 1999 as defined under Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) (where  the base period is the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding  the first day of the current calendar year 1999). The look-back period  is the period from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1999, the transition  date is June 30, 1995, and the taxable year of change is the taxable  year beginning July 1, 1999.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments to foreign corporations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case  of a   foreign corporation, the corporation shall make the adjustments set  forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section. The adjustments  shall be made on the first day of the taxable year of change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of certain section 988 transactions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exchange gain  or loss from section 988 transactions unrealized as of the transition  date. A foreign corporation shall adjust earnings and profits by the  amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss that was attributable to  a section 988 transaction (as defined in sections 988(c)(1)(A), (B), and  (C)) that was denominated in terms of (or determined by reference to)  the dollar and was held by the corporation on the transition date. Such  gain or loss shall be computed as if recognized on the transition date  and shall be reduced by any gain and increased by any loss recognized by  the corporation with respect to such transaction during the look-back  period. The amount of such gain or loss shall be determined without  regard to the limitations of section 988(b) (i.e., whether any gain or  loss would be realized on the transaction as a whole). The character and  source of such gain or loss shall be determined under section 988.  Proper adjustments shall be made to account for gain or loss taken into  account by reason of this paragraph (b)(2). See Sec. 1.985-5(f) Example  1, footnote 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of a section 988 transaction entered into and  terminated during the look-back period. A foreign corporation shall  reduce earnings and profits by the amount of any gain, and increase  earnings and profits by the amount of any loss, that was recognized with  respect to any dollar denominated section 988 transactions entered into  and terminated during the look-back period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Opening balance sheet. The opening balance sheet of a foreign  corporation for the taxable year of change shall be determined as if the  corporation had changed its functional currency to the dollar by  applying Sec. 1.985-5(c) on the transition date and had translated its  assets and liabilities acquired and incurred during the look-back period  under Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Earnings and profits adjustments--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pre-1987 accumulated  profits. The foreign income taxes and accumulated profits or deficits in  accumulated profits of a foreign corporation that are attributable to  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, as stated on the  transition date, and that were maintained for purposes of section 902 in  the old functional currency, shall be translated into dollars at the  spot rate in effect on the transition date. The applicable accumulated  profits shall be reduced on a last-in, first-out basis by the aggregate  dollar amount (translated from functional currency in accordance with  the rules of section 989(b)) attributable to earnings and profits that  were distributed (or treated as distributed) during the look-back period  to the extent such amounts distributed exceed the earnings and profits  calculated under (b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii), as applicable. See  Sec. 1.902-1(b)(2)(ii). Once translated into dollars, these pre-1987  taxes and accumulated profits or deficits in accumulated profits shall  (absent a change in functional currency) remain in dollars for all  federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Post-1986 undistributed earnings of a CFC. In the case of a  controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957 or  section 953(c)(1)(B))(CFC) or a foreign corporation subject to the rules  of Sec. 1.904-6(a)(2), the corporation's post-1986 undistributed  earnings in each separate category as defined in Sec. 1.904-5(a)(1) as  of the first day of the taxable year of change (and prior to adjustment  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) shall equal the sum of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings and profits  (or deficit in earnings and profits) in each separate category as  defined in Sec. 1.904-5(a)(1) as stated on the transition date  translated into dollars at the spot rate in effect on the transition  date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and  profits) in each separate category determined under Sec. 1.985-3 for  each post-transition date taxable year prior to the taxable year of  change.</p><p class="depth5">Such amount shall be reduced by the aggregate dollar amount  (translated from functional currency in accordance with the rules of  section 989(b)) attributable to earnings and profits that   were distributed (or treated as distributed) during the look-back period  out of post-1986 earnings and profits in such separate category. For  purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B), the opening balance  sheet for calculating earnings and profits under Sec. 1.985-3 for the  first post-transition year shall be translated into dollars pursuant to  Sec. 1.985-5(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Post-1986 undistributed earnings of other foreign  corporations. In the case of a foreign corporation that is not a CFC or  subject to the rules of Sec. 1.904-6(a)(2), the corporation's post-1986  undistributed earnings shall equal the sum of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings (or deficit)  on the transition date translated into dollars at the spot rate in  effect on the transition date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and  profits) determined under Sec. 1.985-3 for each post-transition date  taxable year (or such later year determined under section 902(c)(3)(A))  prior to the taxable year of change.</p><p class="depth5">Such amount shall be reduced by the aggregate dollar amount  (translated from functional currency in accordance with the rules of  section 989(b)) that was distributed (or treated as distributed) during  the look-back period out of post-1986 earnings and profits. For purposes  of applying this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B), the opening balance sheet for  calculating earnings and profits under Sec. 1.985-3 for the first post- transition year shall be translated into dollars pursuant to Sec. 1.985- 5(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B))</em> of a CFC that changes to DASTM  shall make the adjustments set forth in paragraphs (c) (2) through (5)  of this section on the first day of the taxable year of change.  Adjustments under this section shall be taken into account by the  shareholder (or such shareholder s successor in interest) ratably over  four taxable years beginning with the taxable year of change. Similar  rules shall apply in determining adjustments to income of United States  persons who have made an election under section 1295 to treat a passive  foreign investment company as a qualified electing fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section for purposes of sections 951 through  964, shall be determined on the transition date and to the extent  characterized as subpart F income shall be taken into account in  accordance with the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Such  amounts shall retain their character for all federal income tax purposes  (including sections 902, 959, 960, 961, 1248, and 6038).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recognition of foreign currency gain or loss on previously taxed  earnings and profits on the transition date. Gain or loss is recognized  under section 986(c) as if all previously taxed earnings and profits as  determined on the transition date, if any, were distributed on such  date. Such gain or loss shall be reduced by any foreign currency gain  and increased by any foreign currency loss that was recognized under  section 986(c) with respect to distributions of previously taxed  earnings and profits during the look-back period. Such amount shall be  characterized in accordance with section 986(c) and taken into account  in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> as of the first day of the taxable  year of change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Foreign tax credit. A United States shareholder of a CFC shall  compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960 with  respect to any positive adjustments determined under paragraph (c) of  this section. The amount of foreign tax deemed paid shall be computed  with reference to the full amount of the adjustment and to the post-1986  undistributed earnings determined under paragraph (b)(4) (i) and (ii) of  this section and the post-1986 foreign income taxes of the CFC on the  first day of the taxable year of change (i.e., without taking into  account earnings and taxes for the taxable year of change). For purposes  of section 960, the associated taxes in each separate category shall be  allocated pro rata among, and deemed paid in, the shareholder's taxable  years in which the income is taken into account. (No adjustment to  foreign taxes deemed paid in prior years is required solely by reason of  a negative adjustment to income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> QBU branches--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of a QBU branch, the  taxpayer shall make the adjustments set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)  through (d)(4) of this section. Adjustments under this section shall be  taken into account by the taxpayer ratably over four taxable years  beginning with the taxable year of change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of certain section 988 transactions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exchange gain  or loss from section 988 transactions unrealized as of the transition  date. A QBU branch shall adjust income by the amount of any unrealized  exchange gain or loss that was attributable to a section 988 transaction  (as defined in sections 988(c)(1) (A), (B), and (C)) that was  denominated in terms of (or determined by reference to) the dollar and  was held by the QBU branch on the transition date. Such gain or loss  shall be computed as if recognized on the transition date and shall be  reduced by any gain and increased by any loss recognized by the QBU  branch with respect to such transaction during the look-back period. The  amount of such gain or loss shall be determined without regard to the  limitations of section 988(b) (i.e., whether any gain or loss would be  realized on the transaction as a whole). The character and source of  such gain or loss shall be determined under section 988. Proper  adjustments shall be made to account for gain or loss taken into account  by reason of this paragraph (d)(2). See Sec. 1.985-5(f) Example 1,  footnote 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of a section 988 transaction entered into and  terminated during the look-back period. A QBU branch shall reduce income  by the amount of any gain, and increase income by the amount of any  loss, that was recognized with respect to any dollar denominated section  988 transactions entered into and terminated during the look-back  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deemed termination income adjustment. The taxpayer shall realize  gain or loss attributable to the QBU branch's equity pool (as stated on  the transition date) under the principles of section 987, computed as if  the branch terminated on the transition date. Such amount shall be  reduced by section 987 gain and increased by section 987 loss that was  recognized by such taxpayer with respect to remittances during the look- back period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Branch income adjustment. Branch income in a separate category  shall be determined under Sec. 1.985-3 for each look-back year. For this  purpose, the opening DASTM balance sheet shall be determined under  Sec. 1.985-5. The sum of the difference (positive or negative) between  the amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1.985-3 and amount taken into  account for each year shall be taken into account in the taxable year of  change pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Such amounts shall  retain their character for all federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Opening balance sheet. The opening balance sheet of a QBU branch  for the taxable year of change shall be determined as if the branch had  changed its functional currency to the dollar by applying Sec. 1.985- 5(c) on the transition date and had translated its assets and  liabilities acquired and incurred during the look-back period under  Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years  beginning   after April 6, 1998. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply this  section to all open taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986,  provided each person, and each QBU branch of a person, that is related  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.985-2(d)(3)) to the taxpayer also applies  this section.
