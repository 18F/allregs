The following are examples of unusual circumstances:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The contractor must provide food or dormitory services at remote locations where adequate commercial facilities are not reasonably available.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The contractor's charged (but unproductive) labor costs would be excessive if the services were not available.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If cessation or reduction of food or dormitory operations will not otherwise yield net cost savings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs of food and dormitory services shall include an allocable share of indirect expenses pertaining to these activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the contractor has an arrangement authorizing an employee association to provide or operate a service, such as vending machines in the contractor's plant, and retain the profits, such profits shall be treated in the same manner as if the contractor were providing the service (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contributions by the contractor to an employee organization, including funds from vending machine receipts or similar sources, are allowable only to the extent that the contractor demonstrates that an equivalent amount of the costs incurred by the employee organization would be allowable if directly incurred by the contractor.
