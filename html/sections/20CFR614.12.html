Any new Schedule of Remuneration shall take effect beginning with the first week of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which such schedule is issued, and shall remain applicable until a subsequent schedule becomes effective. Prior schedules shall continue to remain applicable for the periods they were in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Publication. Any new Schedule of Remuneration shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor to the State agencies and the Federal military agencies.
