                                Sec. 784.150  Named operations performed on previously processed

                            <p class="depth0">It will be noted that section 13(b)(4) refers to employees employed  in ``processing'' the named aquatic commodities and not just to ``first  processing'' as does the provision in section 13(a)(5) for such  processing at sea. Accordingly, if the aquatic products, though  subjected to a processing operation, are still in a perishable state,  the subsequent performance of any of the enumerated operations on the  still perishable products will be within the exemption no matter who the  employer performing the exempt operations may be. He may be the same  employer who performed the prior processing or other exempt operation,  another processor, or a wholesaler, as the case may be. As noted in  Sec. 784.138(b), the Department has not questioned the applicability of  the foregoing rule where the operation is performed on frozen, salted,  smoked, or cured fish.</p>
