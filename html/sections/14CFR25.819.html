                            <p class="depth0">For airplanes with a service compartment located below the main deck, which may be occupied during taxi or flight but not during takeoff or landing, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There must be at least two emergency evacuation routes, one at each end of each lower deck service compartment or two having sufficient separation within each compartment, which could be used by each occupant of the lower deck service compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main deck under normal and emergency lighting conditions. The routes must provide for the evacuation of incapacitated persons, with assistance. The use of the evacuation routes may not be dependent on any powered device. The routes must be designed to minimize the possibility of blockage which might result from fire, mechanical or structural failure, or persons standing on top of or against the escape routes. In the event the airplane's main power system or compartment main lighting system should fail, emergency illumination for each lower deck service compartment must be automatically provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There must be a means for two-way voice communication between the flight deck and each lower deck service compartment, which remains available following loss of normal electrical power generating system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There must be an aural emergency alarm system, audible during normal and emergency conditions, to enable crewmembers on the flight deck and at each required floor level emergency exit to alert occupants of each lower deck service compartment of an emergency situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There must be a means, readily detectable by occupants of each lower deck service compartment, that indicates when seat belts should be fastened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a public address system is installed in the airplane, speakers must be provided in each lower deck service compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each occupant permitted in a lower deck service compartment, there must be a forward or aft facing seat which meets the requirements of Sec. 25.785(d), and must be able to withstand maximum flight loads when occupied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For each powered lift system installed between a lower deck service compartment and the main deck for the carriage of persons or equipment, or both, the system must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each lift control switch outside the lift, except emergency stop buttons, must be designed to prevent the activation of the life if the lift door, or the hatch required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or both are open.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An emergency stop button, that when activated will immediately stop

the lift, must be installed within the lift and at each entrance to the lift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There must be a hatch capable of being used for evacuating persons from the lift that is openable from inside and outside the lift without tools, with the lift in any position.
