Each Exchange must receive written approval or conditional approval of its Exchange Blueprint and its performance under the operational readiness assessment consistent with paragraph (c) of this section in order to be considered an approved Exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Significant changes to Exchange Blueprint. The State must notify HHS in writing before making a significant change to its Exchange Blueprint; no significant change to an Exchange Blueprint may be effective until it is approved by HHS in writing or 60 days after HHS receipt of a completed request. For good cause, HHS may extend the review period by an additional 30 days to a total of 90 days.

In this case, the requirements in Sec. Sec. 155.120(c), 155.130 and subparts C, D, E, F, G, H, and K of this part will apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a State does not elect to operate an Exchange under Sec. 155.100(a)(1) or an electing State does not have an approved or conditionally approved Exchange pursuant to Sec. 155.100(a)(1) by January 1, 2013, HHS must (directly or through agreement with a not-for-profit entity) establish and operate such Exchange within the State.
