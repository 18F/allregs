                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Processing of applications. Except as provided in this section, Rural Development will process loan guarantee applications in the order that completed applications are received. Application forms and instruction procedures are available at any Rural Development office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If analysis of the utilization of funds during the fiscal year indicates that, at the rate of current utilization, funds may not be sufficient to sustain that level of activity for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Agency may determine a shortage of funds exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When there is a shortage of funds, the Agency will limit SFHGLP loans to first-time homebuyers or veterans. First-time homebuyers and veterans will be served in the order their applications are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automated underwriting. Rural Development will offer approved lenders an automated system, if available; to process Rural Development guaranteed loans under this part.

The lender must apply for and receive approval from Rural Development to utilize the automated underwriting system. Application forms are available from Rural Development.

Rural Development reserves the right to terminate the lender's use of the automated underwriting system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lenders who utilize the Rural Development automated underwriting system remain responsible for ensuring all data is true and accurately represented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Full documentation and verification, in accordance with Subparts C, D and E of this part, will be retained in the lender's permanent loan file and must confirm the applicant's eligibility, creditworthiness, repayment ability, eligible loan purpose, sufficient collateral, and all other regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lenders who utilize the Rural Development automated underwriting

system will be subject to indemnification requirements in accordance with Sec. 3555.108.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a loan receives an ``Accept'' underwriting recommendation, the lender is generally permitted to submit minimal documentation including the appraisal, flood hazard determination and fully executed request for guarantee, unless the lender is instructed to provide other documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Loan requests that receive a ``Refer'' or ``Refer with Caution'' underwriting recommendation require further review and manual underwriting by the lender to determine whether the applicant meets SFHGLP eligibility requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Lenders who utilize Rural Development's automated underwriting system will validate findings, based upon the output report of the underwriting system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The final submission of the last scoring event must be retained in the lender's permanent loan file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manual underwriting. Lenders may utilize a manual underwriting method. Full documentation and verification, in accordance with Subparts C, D and E of this part will be submitted to Rural Development when requesting a guarantee and maintained in the lender's file. The documentation will confirm the applicant's eligibility, creditworthiness, repayment ability, eligible loan purpose, adequate collateral, and satisfaction of other regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appraisals. The lender must supply a current appraisal report of the property for which the guarantee is requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appraisals must be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approved lenders are responsible for selecting a qualified appraiser and the integrity, accuracy and thoroughness of the appraisals used to support their loan guarantee request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appraiser must report all readily observable property deficiencies, potential environmental hazards, as well as any adverse conditions discovered performing the research involved in completing the appraisal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Agency will conduct reviews of the appraisals prior to issuance of the conditional commitment, and other reviews may be conducted to ensure overall quality of appraisals.

Appraisals from the ineligible appraisers will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Use of an alternative approach to value for appraisals performed in remote rural areas, on tribal lands, or where a lack of market activity exists may be accepted at the Agency's discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The validity period of an appraisal will be 120 days, unless otherwise provided by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Environmental requirements. The lender and Rural Development will meet all environmental responsibilities in accordance with Sec. 3555.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Issuance of a conditional commitment. The lender must demonstrate that all the general loan, applicant, and site eligibility requirements of this part are met before Rural Development will issue a conditional commitment. The lender, however, may obtain any required property inspection reports, such as a well test or construction phase inspections, if applicable and not needed for environmental compliance, after the issuance of the conditional commitment, but prior to loan closing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditional commitment will expire in 90 days from issuance, unless new construction is involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expiration of a conditional commitment may coincide with projected completion of new construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An extension may be granted if the loan cannot be closed due to circumstances beyond the lender's control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lenders may accept or decline the conditional commitment, or submit requests for changes with adequate support and documentation to be reviewed by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Loan guarantee fee.

Once the guarantee has been issued, the fee will not be refunded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Annual fee. The Agency may impose an annual fee of the lender not to exceed 0.5 percent of the average annual scheduled unpaid principal balance of the loan for the life of the loan to allow the Agency to reduce the up-front guarantee in Sec. 3555.107(g). The annual fee will be applicable to purchase and refinance loan transactions. The annual fee may be passed on to the borrower by the lender. The Agency may assess a late charge to the lender if the annual fee is not paid by the due date, and the late charge may be passed on to the borrower. Further administrative guidance is provided in the handbook.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Proper closing and requesting the loan note guarantee.
