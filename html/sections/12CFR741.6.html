                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon written notice from the NCUA Board, Regional Director,  Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance, or Director of the  Office of National Examinations and Supervision, insured credit unions  must file financial and other reports in accordance with the  instructions in the notice. Insured credit unions must use NCUA's  information management system, or other electronic means specified by  NCUA, to submit their data online.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit Union Profile. Insured credit unions must submit to NCUA  a Credit Union Profile, NCUA Form 4501 or its equivalent, within 10 days  after an election or appointment of senior management or volunteer  officials or within 30 days of any change of the information in the  profile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial and statistical report. Natural person credit unions  must file a Call Report with NCUA quarterly in accordance with the  instructions in the NCUA Form 5300. Corporate credit unions must file a  Corporate Credit Union Call Report with NCUA monthly in accordance with  the instructions in the NCUA Form 5310. Credit unions must submit a  corrected Call Report upon notification or the discovery of a need for  correction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistency with GAAP. The accounts of financial statements and  reports required to be filed quarterly under paragraph (a) of this  section must reflect GAAP if the credit union has total assets of $10  million or greater, but may reflect regulatory accounting principles  other than GAAP if the credit union has total assets of less than $10  million (except that a Federally-insured State-chartered credit union  may be required by its state credit union supervisor to follow GAAP  regardless of asset size).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> GAAP sources. GAAP means generally accepted accounting  principles, as defined in Sec. 715.2(e) of this chapter. GAAP is  distinct from GAAS, which means generally accepted auditing standards,  as defined in Sec. 715.2(f) of this chapter. Authoritative sources of  GAAP include, but are not limited to, pronouncements of the Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its predecessor organizations, the  Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) of the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the FASB's Emerging  Issues   Task Force (EITF), and the applicable AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide.
