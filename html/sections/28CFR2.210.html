If the Superior  Court grants the Commission's motion prior to the expiration of the term  originally imposed, the extension ordered by the court shall take effect  upon issuance of the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission may submit the motion for an extension of a term  of   supervised release if the Commission finds that the rehabilitation of  the releasee or the protection of the public from further crimes by the  releasee is likely to require a longer period of supervision than the  court originally contemplated. The Commission's grounds for making such  a finding shall be stated in the motion filed with the court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of this section shall not apply to the  Commission's determination of an appropriate period of further  supervised release following revocation of a term of supervised release.</p>
