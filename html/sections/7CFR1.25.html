[65 FR 46341, July 28, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1--Fee Schedule</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. General.</p><p class="depth0">This schedule sets forth fees to be charged for providing copies of records--including photographic reproductions, microfilm, maps and mosaics, and related services--under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Records and related services are available at the locations specified by agencies in their FOIA implementing regulations. The fees set forth in this schedule are applicable to all agencies of the Department of Agriculture, and are based upon guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued at 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987). No higher fees or charges in addition to those provided for in this schedule may be charged a party requesting services under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Types of services for which fees may be charged.</p><p class="depth0">Subject to the criteria set forth in section 5 of this appendix, fees may be assessed under the Freedom of Information Act on all requests involving such services as record search, duplication, and review. Fees may also be charged in situations involving special service to a request, such as certifying that records requested are true copies, or sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc. For services not covered by the FOIA or by this appendix, agencies may set their own fees in accordance with applicable law, or costs incurred will be assessed the requester at the actual cost to the Government. For example, where records are required to be shipped from one office to another by commercial carrier in order to timely answer a request, the actual freight charge will be assessed the requester.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Instances in which fees will not be charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for requests seeking records for a commercial use (as specified in section 5 of this appendix), no charge shall be made for either: (1) The first 100 pages of duplicated records (8\1/2\x14 or smaller-size paper); or (2) The first two hours of manual search time, or the equivalent value of computer search time as defined in section 4(e) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No charge shall be made--even to commercial use requesters--if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. For USDA, this figure has been calculated to be $25.00.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees may not be charged for time spent by an agency employee in resolving legal or policy issues, or in monitoring a requester's inspection of agency records. No charge shall be made for normal postage costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records shall also be furnished without charge under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When filling requests from other Departments or Government agencies for official use, provided quantities requested are reasonable in number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When members of the public provide their own copying equipment, in which case no copying fee will be charged (although search and review fees may still be assessed); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When any notices, decisions, orders, or other materials are required by law to be served on a party in any proceeding or matter before any Department agency.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Fees for records and related services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The fee for photocopies of pages 8\1/2\x14 or smaller shall be $0.20 per page (per individual side of sheet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fee for photocopies larger than 8\1/2\x14 shall be $0.50 per linear foot of the longest side of the copy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fee for other forms of duplicated records, such as microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (i.e., magnetic tape or disk), shall be the actual direct cost of producing the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manual searches shall be charged for in one of the two following manners in the given order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When feasible, at the salary rate of the employee conducting the search, plus 16 percent of the employee's basic pay; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively, at the rate of $10.00 per hour for clerical time, and $20.00 per hour for supervisory or professional time. Charges should be computed to the nearest quarter hour required for the search. A homogeneous class of personnel, for purposes of conducting manual searches and where more than one individual is involved, is a group of employees of like rank, grade, pay or position. A heterogeneous class of personnel is a group of employees of unlike rank, grade, pay, or position. If a heterogeneous class of personnel is involved in a search then the search shall be charged for at the salary rate of the individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mainframe computer searches and services shall be charged for at the rates established in the Users Manual or Handbook published by the computer center at which the work will be performed. Where the rate has not been established, the rate shall be $27.00 per minute.

Levels of fees for each category of requesters.</p><p class="depth0">Under the FOIA, there are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. FOIA prescribes specific levels of fees for each category:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial use requesters--For commercial use requesters, agencies shall assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to the free search time or duplication referenced in section 3(a) of this appendix. Agencies may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records for commercial use requesters even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A commercial use requester is defined as one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, agencies must determine whether the requester will put the records to a commercial use. Where an agency has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the agency may seek additional clarification from the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters--Fees for this category of requesters shall be limited to the cost of providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for search or review services. To qualify for this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of an eligible institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific research (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' (see section 5(a)(1)) of this appendix basis, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requesters who are representatives of the news media--Fees for this category of requesters shall also be limited to the cost of providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for providing search or review services. Requests in this category must not be made for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term representative of the news media refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals which disseminate news and who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All other requesters--Fees for requesters who do not fit into the categories described in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall be assessed for the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to a request. No charge, however, shall be made to requesters in this category for: (1) The first 100 duplicated pages; or (2) the first two hours of manual search time, or the equivalent value of computer search time as defined in section 4(e) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Fee waivers and reductions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies shall waive or reduce fees on request for records if disclosure of the information in the records is deemed to be in the public interest. A request is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining when fees shall be waived or reduced, agencies should consider the following six factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request, i.e., whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed, i.e., whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding, i.e., whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public understanding of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest, i.e., whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agency may, in its discretion, waive or reduce fees associated with a request for disclosure, regardless of whether a waiver or reduction has been requested, if the agency determines that disclosure will primarily benefit the general public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agencies may also waive or reduce fees under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the furnishings of records or a service without charge or at a reduced rate is an appropriate courtesy to a foreign country or international organization, or where comparable fees are set on a reciprocal basis with a foreign country or an international organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the requester is engaged in a nonprofit activity designed for the public safety, health, or welfare; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where it is determined that payment of the full fee by a State or local government or nonprofit group would not be in the interest of the program involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fees shall be waived, however, without discretion in all circumstances where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7. Restrictions regarding copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies may restrict numbers of photocopies and directives furnished the public to one copy of each page. Copies of forms provided the public shall also be held to the minimum practical. Persons requiring any large quantities should be encouraged to take single copies to commercial sources for further appropriate reproduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Single or multiple copies of transcripts, provided to the Department under a reporting service contract, may be obtained by the public from the contractor at a cost not to exceed the cost per page charged to the Department for extra copies. The contractor may add a postage charge when mailing orders to the public, but no other charge may be added.</p><p class="depth0">Section 8. Payments of fees and charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payments should be billed for to the fullest extent possible at the time the requested materials are furnished. Payments should be made by requesters within 30 days of the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payments shall be made by check, draft, or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, although payments may be made in cash, particularly where services are performed in response to a visit to a Department office. All payments should be sent to the address indicated by the agency responding to the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the estimated fees to be charged exceed $250.00, agencies may require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges (but not less than 50 percent) from the requester before any of the requested materials are reproduced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In instances where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee, an agency may require the requester to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest as provided in section 9 of this appendix, as well as the full estimated fee associated with any new request before the agency begins to process that new or subsequent request.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9. Interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">On requests that result in fees being assessed, agencies may begin levying interest charges on an upaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth0">Section 10. Effect of the Debt Collection Act on fees.</p><p class="depth0">In attempting to collect fees levied under the FOIA, agencies shall abide by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711-3720A, in disclosing information to consumer reporting agencies and in the use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment.
Section 11. Photographic and digital reproductions of microfilm, aerial</p><p class="depth0">imagery, and maps.</p><p class="depth0">Microfilm, aerial imagery, and maps that have been obtained in connection with the authorized work of this Department may be sold at the estimated cost of furnishing reproductions of these records, using photographic, digital, or other methods of reproduction as prescribed in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Section 12.
