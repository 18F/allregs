                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraiser Roster. HUD maintains a list of appraisers. A  mortgagee must select only an appraiser from this list for the appraisal  of a property that is to be the security for an FHA-insured single  family mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclaimer. Since an appraisal is performed to determine the  maximum insurable mortgage and to also protect the FHA insurance funds,  the inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster does not create or  imply a warranty or endorsement to a prospective homebuyer or to any  other organization or individual by HUD of the listed appraiser nor does  it represent a warranty of any appraisal performed by the listed  appraiser. The inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster means  only that a listed appraiser has met the qualifications and conditions,  prescribed by the Secretary, for inclusion on the Appraiser Roster.</p>
