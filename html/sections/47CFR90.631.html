                                Sec. 90.631  Trunked systems loading, construction and authorization
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-SMR trunked systems will be authorized on the basis of a  loading criteria of one hundred (100) mobile stations per channel. For  purposes of determining compliance with trunked system loading  requirements under this subpart, the term ``mobile station'' includes  vehicular and portable mobile units and control stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each applicant for a non-SMR trunked system must certify that a  minimum of seventy (70) mobiles for each channel authorized will be  placed into operation within five (5) years of the initial license  grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for SMR applicants and as provided in paragraph (d) of  this section, an applicant seeking to expand a trunked system by  requesting additional channels from the Commission, or through  intercategory sharing, or through an assignment, must have a loading  level of seventy (70) mobiles per channel on the existing system that is  the subject of the expansion request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In rural areas, a licensee of a trunked system may request to  increase its system capacity by five more channels than it has  constructed without meeting the loading requirements specified in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A rural area is defined for  purposes of this section as being beyond a 100-mile radius of the  following   designated centers of the following urban areas: New York, NY; Los  Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; Philadelphia, PA; San Francisco, CA; Detroit,  MI; Boston, MA; Houston, TX; Washington, DC; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX;  Miami, FL; Cleveland, OH; St. Louis, MO; Atlanta, GA; Pittsburgh, PA;  Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Seattle, WA; San Diego, CA; and  Tampa-St.Petersburg, FL. The coordinates for the centers of these areas  are those referenced in Sec. 90.741, except that the coordinates  (referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)) for Tampa-St.  Petersburg are latitude 28001.1" N, longitude 822659.3" W.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 90.629, licensees of trunked  facilities must complete construction within one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a station is not placed in permanent operation, in accordance  with the technical parameters of the station authorization, within one  year, except as provided in Sec. 90.629, its license cancels  automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not  considered to be placed in operation unless at least two associated  mobile stations, or one control station and one mobile station, are also  placed in operation. An SMR licensee with facilities that have  discontinued operations for 90 continuous days is presumed to have  permanently discontinued operations, unless the licensee notifies the  Commission otherwise, using FCC Form 601, prior to the end of the 90 day  period and provides a date on which operation will resume, which date  must not be in excess of 30 additional days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for  licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing  of need. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems in the Public  Safety, Special Emergency, Telephone Maintenance, and Power Radio  Services may be authorized on a primary basis if such stations are the  first to be authorized in their area of operation on the frequency or  group of frequencies. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems  in all other services will be authorized only on a secondary, non- interference basis to cochannel licensees. To determine system loading,  the total number of mobile units and control stations operating in the  wide-area system shall be counted with respect to the total number of  base station frequencies assigned to the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be  authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of  this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or  statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading  purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in  which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be  counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with  which it communicates regularly.
