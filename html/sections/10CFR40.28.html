                                Sec. 40.28  General license for custody and long-term care of uranium
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A general license is issued for the custody of and long-term  care, including monitoring, maintenance, and emergency measures  necessary to protect the public health and safety and other actions  necessary to comply with the standards in this part for uranium or  thorium mill tailings sites closed under title II of the Uranium Mill  Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as amended. The licensee will be  the Department of Energy, another Federal agency designated by the  President, or a State where the disposal site is located. The purpose of  this general license is to ensure that uranium and thorium mill tailings  disposal sites will be cared for in such a manner as to protect the  public health, safety, and the environment after closure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The general license in paragraph (a) of this section becomes  effective when the Commission terminates, or concurs in an Agreement  State's termination of, the current specific license and a site Long- Term Surveillance Plan (LTSP) meeting the requirements of this section  has been accepted by the Commission. There is no termination of this  general license. If the LTSP has not been formally received by the NRC  prior to termination of the current specific license, the Commission may  issue a specific order to the intended custodial agency to ensure  continued control and surveillance of the disposal site to protect the  public health, safety, and the environment. The Commission will not  unnecessarily delay the termination of the specific license solely on  the basis that an acceptable LTSP has not been received. The LTSP may  incorporate by reference information contained in documents previously  submitted to the Commission if the references to the individual  incorporated documents are clear and specific. Each LTSP must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A))</em> and licensed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed description, which can be in the form of a reference  of the final disposal site conditions, including existing ground water  characterization. This description must be detailed enough so that  future inspectors will have a baseline to determine changes to the site  and when these changes are   serious enough to require maintenance or repairs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the long-term surveillance program, including  proposed inspection frequency and reporting to the Commission (as  specified in appendix A, Criterion 12 of this part), frequency and  extent of ground water monitoring if required, appropriate constituent  concentration limits for ground water, inspection personnel  qualifications, inspection procedures, recordkeeping and quality  assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The criteria for follow-up inspections in response to  observations from routine inspections or extreme natural events; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The criteria for instituting maintenance or emergency measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The long-term care agency who has a general license established  by paragraph (a) of this section shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Implement the LTSP as described in paragraph (b) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Care for the disposal site in accordance with the provisions of  the LTSP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notify the Commission of any changes to the LTSP; the changes  may not conflict with the requirements of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guarantee permanent right-of-entry to Commission representatives  for the purpose of periodic site inspections; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notify the Commission prior to undertaking any significant  construction, actions, or repairs related to the disposal site, even if  the action is required by a State or another Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon application, the Commission may issue a specific license,  as specified in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978,  as amended, permitting the use of surface and/or subsurface estates  transferred to the United States or a State. Although an application may  be received from any person, if permission is granted, the person who  transferred the land to DOE or the State shall receive the right of  first refusal with respect to this use of the land. The application must  demonstrate that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed action does not endanger the public health, safety,  welfare, or the environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the proposed action is of a temporary or permanent  nature, the site would be maintained and/or restored to meet  requirements in appendix A of this part for closed sites; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adequate financial arrangements are in place to ensure that the  byproduct materials will not be disturbed, or if disturbed that the  applicant is able to restore the site to a safe and environmentally  sound condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The general license in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt  from parts 19, 20, and 21 of this chapter, unless significant  construction, actions, or repairs are required. If these types of  actions are to be undertaken, the licensee shall explain to the  Commission which requirements from these parts apply for the actions and  comply with the appropriate requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In cases where the Commission determines that transfer of title  of land used for disposal of any byproduct materials to the United  States or any appropriate State is not necessary to protect the public  health, safety or welfare or to minimize or eliminate danger to life or  property (Atomic Energy Act, Sec. 83(b)(1)(A)), the Commission will  consider specific modifications of the custodial agency's LTSP  provisions on a case-by-case basis.
