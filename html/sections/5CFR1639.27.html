                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board's payroll office will determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by the Board's payroll office of certification for the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Types of collection--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lump-sum offset. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee

has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deductions from final check. A deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR chapter II, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Deductions from other sources. If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Board, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Board may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR chapter II.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Board's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Precedence of debts owed to the Board. For Board employees, debts owed to the Board generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event that a debt to the Board is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the Board may decide whether to have the first debt repaid in full before collecting the claim or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Board can be collected in one pay period, the Board payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the debt to the Board. When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Board will be the primary con sideration in the payroll office's determination of the order in which the debts should be collected.</p>
