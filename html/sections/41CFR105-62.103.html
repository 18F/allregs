Persons outside the executive  branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be  authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written determination is made by the Administrator of General  Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of  national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Access is limited to that information over which GSA has  classification jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be  located with a reasonable amount of effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize  a review of his or her notes and manuscript   for determination that no classified information is contained therein by  signing a statement entitled ``Conditions Governing Access to Official  Records for Historical Research Purposes.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2  years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions  of this Sec. 105-62.103(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access by former Presidential appointees. Persons who previously  occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the  President may not remove classified information or material upon  departure from office as all such material must remain under the  security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized  access to classified information or material which they originated,  received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in  public office, provided that the GSA element having classification  jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written  determination that access is consistent with the interests of national  security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the  individual seeking access agrees:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To safeguard the information,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that  no classified information is contained therein, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To ensure that no classified information will be further  disseminated or published.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access during judicial proceedings. Classified information will  not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial  proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an  order or subpoena issued by a Federal court, the Administrator may  authorize the limited release of classified information if he or she  determines that the interests of justice cannot otherwise be served.  Appropriate safeguards will be established to protect such classified  material released for use in judicial proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to material in NARS custody. The Archivist of the United  States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to  NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of  General Services in 41 CFR part 105-61.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access by the General Accounting Office and congressional  committees. Classified information may be released to the General  Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically  authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by  law.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 105	62.2_Declassification and Downgrading</p>
