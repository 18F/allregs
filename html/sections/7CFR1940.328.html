                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Numerous States have enacted environmental policy acts or  regulations similar to NEPA, hereafter referred to as State NEPA's. It  is important that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  staff have an understanding of which States have such requirements and  how they apply to applicant's proposals. It will be the responsibility  of each State Director to determine the applicable State requirements  and to establish a working relationship with the State personnel  responsible for their implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In processing projects located within States having State  NEPA's, the preparer of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 assessment will determine as early as possible in the  assessment process whether the project falls under the requirements of  the State NEPA. If it does, one of the following cases will exist and  the appropriate actions specified will be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant has complied with the State's NEPA, and it was  determined under the State's requirements that the proposed project  would not result in sufficient potential impacts to warrant the  preparation of an impact statement or other detailed environmental  report required by the State NEPA. This finding or conclusion by the  State will be considered in the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354's review, and any supporting information used by the  State will be requested. However, the State's finding can never be the  total basis for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  environmental impact determination. An independent and thorough review  in accordance with the requirements of this subpart must be conducted by  the preparer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant has complied with the State NEPA, and it was  determined under its implementing guidelines that a significant impact  will result. This fact will be given great weight in the Agency's  environmental determination. However, the State's definition of  significant environmental impact may encompass a much lower threshold of  impacts compared to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354's. In such a case, if the preparer does not believe that a  significant impact will result under Agency guidelines for determining  significant impacts, the environmental assessment will be prepared and  include a detailed discussion with supporting information as to why the  environmental reviewer's recommendation differs from that of the  State's. However, the assessment cannot be completed until the State's  impact statement requirements have been fulfilled by the applicant and  the resulting impact statement has been reviewed by the preparer. An  environmental impact determination will then be executed based upon the  assessment and the statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It should be emphasized that at no time does the completion of  an impact statement under the requirements of a State NEPA obviate the  requirement for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to  prepare an impact statement. Consequently, as soon as it is clear to the  preparer that the Agency will have to prepare a statement, every attempt  should be made to accomplish the statement simultaneously with the  State's. Coordination with State personnel is necessary so that data and  expertise can be shared. In this manner, duplication of effort and the  review periods for the separate statements can be minimized. This  process clearly requires a close working relationship with the  appropriate State personnel.</p>
