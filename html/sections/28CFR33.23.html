                            <p class="depth0">In order to insure the most efficient and effective use of grant  funds, the Justice Assistance Act places restrictions on the award of  block monies for routine equipment, personnel costs, construction,  supplanting of state and local funds, and land acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equipment and hardware. The purchase or acquisition of equipment  or hardware with grant funds is prohibited unless the purchase or  acquisition is an incidental and necessary part of a program. Section  406(c)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General salaries and personnel costs. Payment of personnel costs  with grant funds is prohibited unless the costs are an incidental and  necessary part of a program. Section 406(c)(1) of the Act. Programs  which have as their primary purpose the payment of usual salaries paid  to employees generally, or to specific classes of employees within a  jurisdiction, are prohibited. Notwithstanding the above, grant funds may  be used to compensate personnel for time engaged in conducting or  undergoing training programs or the compensation of personnel engaged in  research, development demonstration, or short-term programs. Section  406(c)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Land acquisition. Acquisition of land with grant funds is  prohibited. Section 406(c)(3) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ineffective programs. The use of grant funds is prohibited for  programs or projects which, based upon evaluations by the National  Institute of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Bureau of Justice  Statistics, state or local agencies, and other public or private  organizations, have been demonstrated to offer a low probability of  improving the functioning of the criminal justice system. The Bureau of  Justice Assistance will formally identify ineffective programs by notice  in the Federal Register after opportunity for public comment. Section  406(c)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administrative costs. The use of grant funds to pay for costs  incurred in applying for or administering the block grant is prohibited.  Block grant funds may only be used to carry out programs that fall  within one of the purposes listed in section 403(a) of the Justice  Assistance Act. Section 403(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Period of project support. A grant recipient may receive block  grant funds for a specific program or project for a period not to exceed  four years. The four-year maximum allowable period of funding includes  any period prior to the Justice Assistance Act when the program or  project was supported by funds made available under title I of the  Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Section 403(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Non-supplantation. Block grant funds shall not be used to  supplant state or local funds, but will be used to increase the amounts  of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal aid, be made  available for criminal justice activities. Section 405(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Purposes of Block Grant Funds</p>
