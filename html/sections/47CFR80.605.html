Before submitting an application for a radionavigation station, an applicant must obtain written permission from the cognizant Coast Guard District Commander at the area in which the device will be located. The Commission may request an applicant to provide documentation as to this fact.

Applications for certification of these transponders must include a description of the technical characteristics of the equipment including the scheme of interrogation and the characteristics of the transponder response, and test results demonstrating the device meets each applicable requirement of this ITU-R recommendation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The use of ship station transponders in the band 2900-3100 or 9300-9500 MHz other than those described in Sec.
