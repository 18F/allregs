Except as provided in Sec.  1.215(c), any patent application publication  will not include drawings filed after the application has been placed on  the files for examination. Unless applicant is otherwise notified in an  Office action, objections to the drawings in a utility or plant  application will not be held in abeyance, and a request to hold  objections to the drawings in abeyance will not be considered a bona  fide attempt to advance the application to final action (Sec.   1.135(c)). If a drawing in a design application meets the requirements  of Sec.  1.84(e), (f), and (g) and is suitable for reproduction, but is  not otherwise in compliance with Sec.  1.84, the drawing may be admitted  for examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office will not release drawings for purposes of correction.
