                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All disturbed areas shall be restored in a timely  manner (1) to conditions that are capable of supporting the uses which  they were capable of supporting before any mining, or (2) to higher or  better uses achievable under criteria and procedures of paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining premining use of land. The premining uses of land to  which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which the  land previously supported if the land had not been previously mined and  had been properly managed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The postmining land use for land that has been previously mined  and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best  use that can be achieved and is compatible with surrounding areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The postmining land use for land that has received improper  management shall be judged on the basis of the premining use of  surrounding lands that have received proper management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the premining use of the land was changed within 5 years of  the beginning of mining, the comparison of postmining use to premining  use shall include a comparison with the historic use of the land as well  as its use immediately preceding mining.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Land-use categories. Land use is categorized in the following  groups. Change from one to another land use category in premining to  postmining constitutes an alternate land use and the permittee shall  meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and all other  applicable environmental protection performance standards of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Heavy industry. Manufacturing facilities, powerplants, airports  or similar facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Light industry and commercial services. Office buildings,  stores, parking facilities, apartment housed, motels, hotels, or similar  facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public services. Schools, hospitals, churches, libraries, water- treatment facilities, solid-waste disposal facilities, public parks and  recreation facilities, major transmission lines, major pipelines,  highways, underground and surface utilities, and other servicing  structures and appurtenances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Residential. Single- and multiple-family housing (other than  apartment houses) with necessary support facilities. Support facilities  may include commercial services incorporated in and comprising less than  5 percent of the total land area of housing capacity, associated open  space, and minor vehicle parking and recreation facilities supporting  the housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cropland. Land used primarily for the production of cultivated  and close-growing crops for harvest alone or in association with sod  crops. Land used for facilities in support of farming operations are  included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rangeland. Includes rangelands and forest lands which support a  cover of herbaceous or scrubby vegetation suitable for grazing or  browsing use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Hayland or pasture. Land used primarily for the long-term  production of adapted, domesticated forage plants to be grazed by  livestock or cut and cured for livestock feed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Forest land. Land with at least a 25 percent tree canopy or land  at least 10 percent stocked by forest trees of any size, including land  formerly having had such tree cover and that will be naturally or  artificially reforested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Impoundments of water. Land used for storing water for  beneficial uses such as stock ponds, irrigation, fire protection,  recreation, or water supply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Fish and wildlife habitat and recreation lands. Wetlands, fish  and wildlife habitat, and areas managed primarily for fish and wildlife  or recreation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Combined uses. Any appropriate combination of land uses where  one land use is designated as the primary land use and one or more other  land uses are designated as secondary land uses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for approving alternative postmining use of land. An  alternative postmining land use shall be approved by the regulatory  authority, after consultation with the landowner or the land-management  agency having jurisdiction over State or Federal lands, if the following  criteria are met. Proposals to remove an entire coal seam running  through the upper part of a mountain, ridge, or hill must also meet  these criteria in addition to the requirements of Sec. 716.3 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed land use is compatible with adjacent land use and,  where applicable, with existing local, State or Federal land use  policies and plans. A written statement of the views of the authorities  with statutory responsibilities for land use policies and plans shall  accompany the request for approval. The permittee shall obtain any  required approval of local, State or Federal land management agencies,  including any necessary zoning or other changes necessarily required for  the final land use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific plans have been prepared which show the feasibility of  the proposed land use as related to needs, projected land use trends,  and markets and that include a schedule showing how the proposed use  will be developed and achieved within a reasonable time after mining and  be sustained. The regulatory authority may require appropriate  demonstrations to show that the planned procedures are feasible,  reasonable, and integrated with mining and reclamation, and that the  plans will result in successful reclamation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provision of any necessary public facilities is assured as  evidenced by letters of commitment from parties other than the  permittee, as appropriate, to provide them in a manner compatible with  the permittee's plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specific and feasible plans for financing attainment and  maintenance of the postmining land use including letters of commitment  from parties other than the permittee as appropriate, if the postmining  land use is to be developed by such parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The plans are designed under the general supervision of a  registered professional engineer, or other appropriate professional, who  will ensure that the plans conform to applicable accepted standards for  adequate land stability, drainage, and vegetative cover, and aesthetic  design appropriate for the postmining use of the site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The proposed use or uses will neither present actual or probable  hazard   to public health or safety nor will they pose any actual or probable  threat of water flow diminution or pollution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The use or uses will not involve unreasonable delays in  reclamation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Necessary approval of measures to prevent or mitigate adverse  effects on fish and wildlife has been obtained from the regulatory  authority and appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management  agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Proposals to change premining land uses of range, fish and  wildlife habitat, forest land, hayland, or pasture to a postmining  cropland use, where the cropland would require continous maintenance  such as seeding, plowing, cultivation, fertilzation, or other similar  practices to be practicable or to comply with applicable Federal, State,  and local laws, shall be reviewed by the regulatory authority to assure  that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is a firm written commitment by the permittee or by the  landowner or land manager to provide sufficient crop management after  release of applicable performance bonds to assure that the proposed  postmining cropland use remains practical and reasonable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is sufficient water available and committed to maintain  crop production; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Topsoil quality and depth are shown to be sufficient to  support the proposed use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The regulatory authority has provided by public notice not less  than 45 days nor more than 60 days for interested citizens and local,  State and Federal agencies to review and comment on the proposed land  use.
