                            <p class="depth0">A franchising authority may require the production of proprietary  information to make a rate determination in those cases where cable  operators have submitted initial rates, or have proposed rate increases,  pursuant to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing or a  cost-of-service showing. The franchising authority shall state a  justification for each item of information requested and, where related  to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing, indicate the  question or   section of the form to which the request specifically relates. Upon  request to the franchising authority, the parties to a rate proceeding  shall have access to such information, subject to the franchising  authority's procedures governing non-disclosure by the parties. Public  access to such proprietary information shall be governed by applicable  state or local law.  [59 FR 17973, Apr. 15, 1994]</p>
