No person may sell or issue a gift certificate, store  gift card, or general-use prepaid card with an expiration date, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person has established policies and procedures to provide  consumers with a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or  card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card  expiration date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expiration date for the underlying funds is at least the  later of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five years after the date the gift certificate was initially  issued, or the date on which funds were last loaded to a store gift card  or general-use prepaid card; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The certificate or card expiration date, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following disclosures are provided on the certificate or  card, as applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The expiration date for the underlying funds or, if the  underlying funds do not expire, that fact;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A toll-free telephone number and, if one is maintained, a Web  site that a   consumer may use to obtain a replacement certificate or card after the  certificate or card expires if the underlying funds may be available;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except where a non-reloadable certificate or card bears an  expiration date that is at least seven years from the date of  manufacture, a statement, disclosed with equal prominence and in close  proximity to the certificate or card expiration date, that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The certificate or card expires, but the underlying funds either  do not expire or expire later than the certificate or card, and;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The consumer may contact the issuer for a replacement card; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No fee or charge is imposed on the cardholder for replacing the  gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card or for  providing the certificate or card holder with the remaining balance in  some other manner prior to the funds expiration date, unless such  certificate or card has been lost or stolen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional disclosure requirements for gift certificates or  cards. The following disclosures must be provided in connection with a  gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, as  applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fee disclosures. For each type of fee that may be imposed in  connection with the certificate or card (other than a dormancy,  inactivity, or service fee subject to the disclosure requirements under  paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the following information must be  provided on or with the certificate or card:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The type of fee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the fee (or an explanation of how the fee will be  determined); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The conditions under which the fee may be imposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (f)(1)  of this section must be disclosed on the certificate or card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compliance dates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective date for gift certificates,  store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards.
