                                19.705-4  Reviewing the subcontracting plan.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The contracting officer shall review the subcontracting plan for  adequacy,   ensuring that the required information, goals, and assurances are  included (see 19.704).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No detailed standards apply to every subcontracting plan.  Instead, the contracting officer shall consider each plan in terms of  the circumstances of the particular acquisition, including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous involvement of small business concerns as prime  contractors or subcontractors in similar acquisitions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proven methods of involving small business concerns as  subcontractors in similar acquisitions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The relative success of methods the contractor intends to use to  meet the goals and requirements of the plan, as evidenced by records  maintained by contractors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, under a sealed bid solicitation, a bidder submits a plan  that does not cover each of the 11 required elements (see 19.704), the  contracting officer shall advise the bidder of the deficiency and  request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder  does not submit a plan that incorporates the required elements within  the time allotted, the bidder shall be ineligible for award. If the  plan, although responsive, evidences the bidder's intention not to  comply with its obligations under the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of  Small Business Concerns, the contracting officer may find the bidder  nonresponsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer shall  determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of  each of the 11 elements of the plan (see 19.704). Subcontracting goals  should be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result  from the offeror expending good faith efforts to use small business,  veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small  business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and  women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum practicable  extent. The contracting officer shall take particular care to ensure  that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize  exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of  substantiating good faith efforts. Additionally, particular attention  should be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken, would be  considered a good faith effort. No goal should be negotiated upward if  it is apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the  Government's cost or seriously impede the attainment of acquisition  objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see 52.219-10, Incentive  Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract  effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly  increase subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged  business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned  small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business  concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting  plan, the contracting officer should take the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain information available from the cognizant contract  administration office, as provided for in 19.706(a), and evaluate the  offeror's past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or  similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small  business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small  business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business  concerns. If information is not available on a specific type of product  or service, evaluate the offeror's overall past performance and consider  the performance of other contractors on similar efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F)(iii), ensure that the  goals offered are attainable in relation to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subcontracting opportunities available to the contractor,  commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the  contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pool of eligible subcontractors available to fulfill the  subcontracting opportunities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The actual performance of such contractor in fulfilling the  subcontracting goals specified in prior plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that the subcontracting goals are consistent with the  offeror's certified cost or pricing data or data other than certified  cost or pricing data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Evaluate the offeror's make-or-buy policy or program to ensure  that it does not conflict with the offeror's proposed subcontracting  plan and is in the Government's interest. If the contract involves  products or services that are particularly specialized or not generally  available in the commercial market, consider the offeror's current  capacity to perform the work and the possibility of reduced  subcontracting opportunities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the offeror's  make-or-buy policies or programs, the nature of the supplies or services  to be subcontracted, the known availability of small business, veteran- owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business,  HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned  small business concerns in the geographical area where the work will be  performed, and the potential contractor's long-standing contractual  relationship with its suppliers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Advise the offeror of available sources of information on  potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled  veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small  disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors,  as well as any specific concerns known to be potential subcontractors.  If the offerors proposed goals are questionable, the contracting officer  must emphasize that the information should be used to develop realistic  and acceptable goals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Obtain advice and recommendations from the SBA procurement  center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not  assigned, see 19.402(a)) and the agency small business specialist.
