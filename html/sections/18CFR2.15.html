The cost rate for such ratios shall be the weighted average cost of long-term debt and preferred stock for the year, and the cost of common equity shall be the interest rate on 10-year government bonds (reported as the Treasury Department's 10-year constant maturity series) computed on the monthly average for the year in question, plus four percentage points (400 basis points).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Statement of Policy adopted herein shall be effective upon issuance of this order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary shall cause prompt publication of this order to be made in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All requests and suggestions not specifically dealt with herein are hereby denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary is hereby authorized to change the appropriate license article upon application by the licensees to reflect the specified reasonable rate of return as adopted herein.
