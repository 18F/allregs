                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a prisoner (or parolee) is scheduled for a hearing in  accordance with the provisions of this part and reasonable doubt exists  as to his mental competency, i.e., his ability to understand the nature  of and participate in scheduled proceedings, a preliminary inquiry to  determine his mental competency shall be conducted by the hearing panel,  hearing examiner or other official (including a U.S. Probation Officer)  designated by the Regional Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The hearing examiner(s) or designated official shall receive  oral or written psychiatric or psychological testimony and other  evidence that may be available. A preliminary determination of mental  competency shall be made upon the testimony, evidence, and personal  observation of the prisoner (or parolee). If the examiner(s) or  designated official determines that the prisoner is mentally competent,  the previously scheduled hearing shall be held. If they determine that  the prisoner is not mentally competent, the previously scheduled hearing  shall be temporarily postponed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever the hearing examiner(s) or designated official  determine that a prisoner is mentally incompetent and postpone the  previously scheduled hearing, they shall forward the record of the  preliminary hearing with their findings to the Regional Commissioner for  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a prisoner, if the Regional Commissioner concurs  with their findings, the Commissioner shall   order the temporarily postponed hearing to be postponed indefinitely  until such time as it is determined that the prisoner has recovered  sufficiently to understand the proceedings. The Regional Commissioner  shall require a progress report on the mental health of the prisoner at  least every six months. When the Regional Commissioner determines that  the prisoner has recovered sufficiently, the Commissioner shall  reschedule the hearing for the earliest feasible date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a parolee in a revocation proceeding, the  Regional Commissioner shall postpone the revocation hearing and order  that the parolee be given a mental health examination in a suitable  facility of the Bureau of Prisons or the District of Columbia. The  postponed revocation hearing shall be held within 60 days, or as soon as  a satisfactory mental health report is submitted. The Regional  Commissioner shall order that appointment of counsel be sought in any  case where the parolee does not have counsel for the revocation hearing.  If the parolee's mental incompetency is raised at a preliminary  interview or probable cause hearing, the Commission (or hearing  official) will make a determination of probable cause and, if probable  cause is found, schedule a revocation hearing as provided in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Regional Commissioner disagrees with the findings of the  hearing examiner(s) or designated official as to the mental competency  of the prisoner, he shall take such action as he deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At a postponed revocation hearing under this section, the  hearing examiner shall make a preliminary determination as to the  parolee's mental competency, taking into account all available mental  health reports, any evidence submitted on the parolee's behalf, any  report from counsel as to counsel's ability to communicate with the  parolee, and the parolee's own responses to the examiner's questioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the hearing examiner determines the parolee to be mentally  competent, the examiner shall conduct the revocation hearing. If counsel  has previously asserted the parolee's incompetence, the examiner shall  offer counsel a brief recess to consult with the parolee before  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the hearing examiner determines the parolee to be mentally  incompetent, the examiner shall conduct the revocation hearing, and  shall take into full account the parolee's mental condition in  determining the facts and recommending a decision as to revocation and  reparole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Commission revokes parole, the Commission may grant  reparole conditioned on the parolee's acceptance into a particular type  of mental health program prior to release from prison, or may grant  reparole with a special condition of supervision that requires  appropriate mental health treatment, including medication. In cases  where no other option appears appropriate, the Commission may grant  reparole conditioned upon the parolee's voluntary self-commitment to a  mental health institution until such time as the parolee has  sufficiently recovered for the Commission to permit the parolee's return  to supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Commission finds that the parolee did not commit the  charged violations of parole, but also finds that the parolee is unable  to fulfill the normal obligations of a parolee by reason of his mental  condition, the Commission may reinstate the parolee to parole with any  appropriate special condition, including the special condition, if  necessary, that the parolee voluntarily commit himself to a mental  institution until such time as the parolee has sufficiently recovered  for the Commission to permit a return to supervision.
