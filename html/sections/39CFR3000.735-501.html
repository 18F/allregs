                            <p class="depth0">Decision-making Commission personnel, as defined in Sec. 3001.7(a),  shall not, either in an official or unofficial capacity, participate in  any ex parte communication--either oral or written--with any person  regarding (1) a particular matter (substantive or procedural) at issue  in contested proceedings before the Commission or (2) the substantive  merits of a matter that is likely to become a particular matter at issue  in contested proceedings before the Commission. A particular matter is  at issue in contested proceedings before the Commission when it is a  subject of controversy in a hearing held under 39 U.S.C. 3624 or  3661(c). However, this section does not prohibit participation in off- the-record proceedings conducted under regulations adopted by the  Commission for hearings held under 39 U.S.C. 3624 or 3661(c).
