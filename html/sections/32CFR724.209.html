When hearings are scheduled, applicants must be prepared to present  their case at the scheduled time. In the absence of any other evidence,  naval discharge review shall be undertaken by examination of available  service and health records of the applicant. Normally, the  responsibility for presenting evidence from outside available service  and health records shall rest with the applicant. Applications in which  elements of relevant information are obviously omitted will be returned  for completion and resubmission.</p>
