Developmental programs will only be considered on an exception basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Programs in which commercial or non-developmental items can  satisfy the military requirement are preferred as candidate programs. A  nominated program will address which standard commercial, industrial  practices will be used in the pilot program and how those practices will  be applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nomination of candidate programs must be accompanied by a list  of waivers being requested to Statutes, FAR, DFARS, DoD Directives \4\  and Instructions,\5\ and where applicable, DoD Component regulations.  Waivers being requested must be accompanied by rationale and  justification for the waiver. The justification must include: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 2.4(b).</p><p class="depth2">\5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 2.4(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> The provision of law proposed to be waived or limited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> The effects of the provision of law on the acquisition,  including specific examples.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> The actions taken to ensure that the waiver or limitation will  not reduce the efficiency, integrity, and effectiveness of the  acquisition process used for the defense acquisition program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> A discussion of the efficiencies or savings, if any, that will  result from the waiver or limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No nominated program shall be accepted until the Under Secretary  of Defense has determined that the candidate program is properly  planned.</p>
