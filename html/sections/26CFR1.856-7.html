                                Sec. 1.856-7  Certain corporations, etc., that are considered to meet
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation, trust, or association which fails to  meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c), or of  both such paragraphs, for any taxable year nevertheless is considered to  have satisfied these requirements if the corporation, trust, or  association meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of  section 856(c)(7) (relating to a schedule attached to the return, the  absence of fraud, and reasonable cause).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of the schedule. The schedule required by subparagraph  (A) of section 856(c)(7) must contain a breakdown, or listing, of the  total amount of gross income falling under each of the separate  subparagraphs of section 856(c) (2) and (3). Thus, for example, the real  estate investment trust, for purposes of listing its income from the  sources described in section 856(c)(2), would list separately the total  amount of dividends, the total amount of interest, the total amount of  rents from real property, etc. The listing is not required to be on a  lease-by-lease, loan-by-loan, or project-by-project basis, but the real  estate investment trust must maintain adequate records on such a basis  with which to substantiate each total amount listed in the schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable cause--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The failure to meet the  requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c)   (or of both paragraphs) will be considered due to reasonable cause and  not due to willful neglect if the real estate investment trust exercised  ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to satisfy the  requirements. Such care and prudence must be exercised at the time each  transaction is entered into by the trust. However, even if the trust  exercised ordinary business care and prudence in entering into a  transaction, if the trust later determines that the transaction results  in the receipt or accrual of nonqualified income and that the amounts of  such nonqualified income, in the context of the trust's overall  portfolio, reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income  requirement to be failed, the trust must use ordinary business care and  prudence in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the transaction,  dispose of property acquired or leased in the transaction, or alter  other elements of its portfolio. In any case, failure to meet an income  source requirement will be considered due to willful neglect and not due  to reasonable cause if the failure is willful and the trust could have  avoided such failure by taking actions not inconsistent with ordinary  business care and prudence. For example, if the trust enters into a  lease knowing that it will produce nonqualified income which reasonably  can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed,  the failure is due to willful neglect even if the trust has a legitimate  business purpose for entering into the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expert advice--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The reasonable reliance on a  reasoned, written opinion as to the characterization for purposes of  section 856 of gross income to be derived (or being derived) from a  transaction generally constitutes ``reasonable cause'' if income from  that transaction causes the trust to fail to meet the requirements of  paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs). The  absence of such a reasoned, written opinion with respect to a  transaction does not, by itself, give rise to any inference that the  failure to meet a percentage of income requirement was without  reasonable cause. An opinion as to the character of income from a  transaction includes an opinion pertaining to the use of a standard form  of transaction or standard operating procedure in a case where such  standard form or procedure is in fact used or followed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the opinion indicates that a portion of the income from a  transaction will be nonqualifed income, the trust must still exercise  ordinary business care and prudence with respect to the nonqualified  income and determine that the amount of that income, in the context of  its overall portfolio, reasonably cannot be expected to cause a source- of-income requirement to be failed. Reliance on an opinion is not  reasonable if the trust has reason to believe that the opinion is  incorrect (for example, because the trust withholds facts from the  person rendering the opinion).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasoned written opinion. For purposes of this subparagraph  (2), a written opinion means an opinion, in writing, rendered by a tax  advisor (including house counsel) whose opinion would be relied on by a  person exercising ordinary business care and prudence in the  circumstances of the particular transaction. A written opinion is  considered ``reasoned'' even if it reaches a conclusion which is  subsequently determined to be incorrect, so long as the opinion is based  on a full disclosure of the factual situation by the real estate  investment trust and is addressed to the facts and law which the person  rendering the opinion believes to be applicable. However, an opinion is  not considered ``reasoned'' if it does nothing more than recite the  facts and express a conclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(4))</em>; sec. 856(e)(5) (88  Stat. 2113; 26 U.S.C. 856(e)(5)); sec. 856(f)(2) (90 Stat. 1751; 26  U.S.C.
