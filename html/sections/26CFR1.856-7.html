                                Sec. 1.856-7  Certain corporations, etc., that are considered to meet
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year nevertheless is considered to have satisfied these requirements if the corporation, trust, or association meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 856(c)(7) (relating to a schedule attached to the return, the absence of fraud, and reasonable cause).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of the schedule. The schedule required by subparagraph (A) of section 856(c)(7) must contain a breakdown, or listing, of the total amount of gross income falling under each of the separate subparagraphs of section 856(c) (2) and (3). Thus, for example, the real estate investment trust, for purposes of listing its income from the sources described in section 856(c)(2), would list separately the total amount of dividends, the total amount of interest, the total amount of rents from real property, etc. The listing is not required to be on a lease-by-lease, loan-by-loan, or project-by-project basis, but the real estate investment trust must maintain adequate records on such a basis with which to substantiate each total amount listed in the schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable cause--(1) In general. The failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c)

(or of both paragraphs) will be considered due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if the real estate investment trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to satisfy the requirements. Such care and prudence must be exercised at the time each transaction is entered into by the trust. However, even if the trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in entering into a transaction, if the trust later determines that the transaction results in the receipt or accrual of nonqualified income and that the amounts of such nonqualified income, in the context of the trust's overall portfolio, reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the trust must use ordinary business care and prudence in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the transaction, dispose of property acquired or leased in the transaction, or alter other elements of its portfolio. In any case, failure to meet an income source requirement will be considered due to willful neglect and not due to reasonable cause if the failure is willful and the trust could have avoided such failure by taking actions not inconsistent with ordinary business care and prudence. For example, if the trust enters into a lease knowing that it will produce nonqualified income which reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the failure is due to willful neglect even if the trust has a legitimate business purpose for entering into the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The reasonable reliance on a reasoned, written opinion as to the characterization for purposes of section 856 of gross income to be derived (or being derived) from a transaction generally constitutes ``reasonable cause'' if income from that transaction causes the trust to fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs). The absence of such a reasoned, written opinion with respect to a transaction does not, by itself, give rise to any inference that the failure to meet a percentage of income requirement was without reasonable cause. An opinion as to the character of income from a transaction includes an opinion pertaining to the use of a standard form of transaction or standard operating procedure in a case where such standard form or procedure is in fact used or followed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Reliance on an opinion is not reasonable if the trust has reason to believe that the opinion is incorrect (for example, because the trust withholds facts from the person rendering the opinion).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasoned written opinion. For purposes of this subparagraph (2), a written opinion means an opinion, in writing, rendered by a tax advisor (including house counsel) whose opinion would be relied on by a person exercising ordinary business care and prudence in the circumstances of the particular transaction. A written opinion is considered ``reasoned'' even if it reaches a conclusion which is subsequently determined to be incorrect, so long as the opinion is based on a full disclosure of the factual situation by the real estate investment trust and is addressed to the facts and law which the person rendering the opinion believes to be applicable. However, an opinion is not considered ``reasoned'' if it does nothing more than recite the facts and express a conclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of section 856(c)(7) to taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976. Pursuant to section 1608(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, paragraph (7) of section 856(c) and this section apply to a taxable year of a real estate investment trust which begins before October 5, 1976, only if as the result of a determination occurring after October 4, 1976, the trust does not meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c), or both paragraphs, as in effect for the taxable year. The requirement that the schedule described in subparagraph (A) of section 856(c)(7) be attached to the income tax return of a real estate investment trust in order

for section 856(c)(7) to apply is not applicable to taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976. For purposes of section 1608(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and this paragraph, the rules relating to determinations prescribed in section 860(e) and Sec. 1.860-2(b)(1) (other than the second, third, and last sentences of Sec. 1.860-2(b)(1)(ii)) shall apply. However, a determination consisting of an agreement between the taxpayer and the district director (or other official to whom authority to sign the agreement is delegated) shall set forth the amount of gross income for the taxable year to which the determination applies, the amount of the 90 percent and 75 percent source-of-income requirements for the taxable year to which the determination applies, and the amount by which the real estate investment trust failed to meet either or both of the requirements. The agreement shall also set forth the amount of tax for which the trust is liable pursuant to section 857(b)(5). The agreement shall also contain a finding as to whether the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs) was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.
