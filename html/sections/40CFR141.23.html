Non-transient, non-community water systems shall conduct monitoring to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant levels specified in Sec.  141.62 in accordance with this section. Transient, non-community water systems shall conduct monitoring to determine compliance with the nitrate and nitrite maximum contaminant levels in Sec. Sec.  141.11 and 141.62 (as appropriate) in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring shall be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point) beginning in the initial compliance period.

If the State grants the waiver, the system is not required to monitor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State may grant a waiver based on a consideration of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Potential asbestos contamination of the water source, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of asbestos-cement pipe for finished water distribution and the corrosive nature of the water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A waiver remains in effect until the completion of the three-year compliance period. Systems not receiving a waiver must monitor in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to source water shall monitor in accordance with the provision of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due both to its source water supply and corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A system which exceeds the maximum contaminant levels as determined in Sec.  141.23(i) of this section shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The State may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement to the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section provided the State has determined that the system is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level.

water system takes a minimum of four quarterly samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> If monitoring data collected after January 1, 1990 are generally consistent with the requirements of Sec.  141.23(b), then the State may allow systems to use that data to satisfy the monitoring requirement for the initial compliance period beginning January 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The frequency of monitoring conducted to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant levels in Sec.  141.62 for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium and thallium shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Groundwater systems shall take one sample at each sampling point during each compliance period. Surface water systems (or combined surface/ground) shall take one sample annually at each sampling point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system may apply to the State for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. States may grant a public water system a waiver for monitoring of cyanide, provided that the State determines that the system is not vulnerable due to lack of any industrial source of cyanide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A condition of the waiver shall require that a system shall take a minimum of one sample while the waiver is effective.

Systems unable to comply with the 24-hour sampling requirement must immediately notify persons served by the public water system in accordance with Sec.  141.202 and meet other Tier 1 public notification requirements under subpart Q of this part. Systems exercising this option must take and analyze a confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the analytical results of the first sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a State-required confirmation sample is taken for any contaminant, then the results of the initial and confirmation sample shall be averaged. The resulting average shall be used to determine the system's compliance in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. States have the discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The State may require more frequent monitoring than specified in

paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section or may require confirmation samples for positive and negative results at its discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Systems may apply to the State to conduct more frequent monitoring than the minimum monitoring frequencies specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compliance with Sec.  141.11 or Sec.  141.62(b) (as appropriate) shall be determined based on the analytical result(s) obtained at each sampling point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For systems which are conducting monitoring at a frequency greater than annual, compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for antimony, arsenic, asbestos, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium or thallium is determined by a running annual average at any sampling point. If the average at any sampling point is greater than the MCL, then the system is out of compliance. If any one sample would cause the annual average to be exceeded, then the system is out of compliance immediately. Any sample below the method detection limit shall be calculated at zero for the purpose of determining the annual average. If a system fails to collect the required number of samples, compliance (average concentration) will be based on the total number of samples collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For systems which are monitoring annually, or less frequently, the system is out of compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for antimony, arsenic, asbestos, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium or thallium if the level of a contaminant is greater than the MCL. If confirmation samples are required by the State, the determination of compliance will be based on the annual average of the initial MCL exceedance and any State-required confirmation samples. If a system fails to collect the required number of samples, compliance (average concentration) will be based on the total number of samples collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for nitrate and nitrate is determined based on one sample if the levels of these contaminants are below the MCLs. If the levels of nitrate and/or nitrite exceed the MCLs in the initial sample, a confirmation sample is required in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and compliance shall be determined based on the average of the initial and confirmation samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Arsenic sampling results will be reported to the nearest 0.001 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Each public water system shall monitor at the time designated by the State during each compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Inorganic analysis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Analysis for the following contaminants shall be conducted in accordance with the methods in the following table, or the alternative methods listed in appendix A to subpart C of this part, or their equivalent as determined by EPA.
