                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 39.11(a)(1), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization that, in either case, is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or is involved

in activities with a more complex risk profile shall maintain financial resources sufficient to enable it to meet its financial obligations to its clearing members notwithstanding a default by the two clearing members creating the largest combined loss to the derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 39.11(a)(1), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization that, in either case, is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or is involved

in activities with a more complex risk profile shall maintain financial resources sufficient to enable it to meet its financial obligations to its clearing members notwithstanding a default by the two clearing members creating the largest combined loss to the derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission shall, if it deems appropriate, determine whether a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. In determining whether a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the Commission shall consider whether the derivatives clearing organization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a systemically important derivatives clearing organization, as defined by Sec. 39.2; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has been determined to be systemically important by one or more jurisdictions other than the United States pursuant to a designation process that considers whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the derivatives clearing organization could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction's financial system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission shall, if it deems appropriate, determine whether any of the activities of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or a subpart C derivatives clearing organization, in addition to clearing credit default swaps, credit default futures, and any derivatives that reference either credit default swaps or credit default futures, has a more complex risk profile. In determining whether an activity has a more complex risk profile, the Commission will consider characteristics such as discrete jump-to-default price changes or high correlations with potential participant defaults as factors supporting (though not necessary for) a finding of a more complex risk profile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this section, if a clearing member controls another clearing member or is under common control with another clearing member, such affiliated clearing members shall be deemed to be a single clearing member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of financial resources. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 39.11(d)(2), assessments for additional guaranty fund contributions (i.e., guaranty fund contributions that are not pre-funded) shall not be included in calculating the financial resources available to meet a systemically important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C derivatives clearing organization's obligations under paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 39.11(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Liquidity resources--(1) Minimum amount of liquidity resources. (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 39.11(e)(1)(ii), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in Sec. 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default by the clearing member creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum amount of liquidity resources. (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 39.11(e)(1)(ii), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in Sec. 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default by the clearing member creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 39.11(e)(1)(ii), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in Sec. 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default by the clearing member creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization that is subject to Sec. 39.33(a)(1) shall consider maintaining eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in Sec. 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default of the two clearing members creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Satisfaction of settlement in all relevant currencies. Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain liquidity

resources that are sufficient to satisfy the obligations required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section in all relevant currencies for which the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization has obligations to perform settlements, as defined in Sec. 39.14(a)(1), to its clearing members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualifying liquidity resources. (i) Only the following liquidity resources are eligible for the purpose of meeting the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only the following liquidity resources are eligible for the purpose of meeting the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cash in the currency of the requisite obligations, held either at the central bank of issue or at a creditworthy commercial bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Committed lines of credit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Committed foreign exchange swaps;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Committed repurchase agreements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> (1) Highly marketable collateral, including high quality, liquid, general obligations of a sovereign nation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The assets described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E)(1) of this section must be readily available and convertible into cash pursuant to prearranged and highly reliable funding arrangements, even in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the arrangements described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization must take appropriate steps to verify that such arrangements do not include material adverse change conditions and are enforceable, and will be highly reliable, in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional liquidity resources. If a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization maintains financial resources in addition to those required to satisfy paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then those resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be saleable with proceeds available promptly or acceptable as collateral for lines of credit, swaps, or repurchase agreements on an ad hoc basis. A systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization should consider maintaining collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks that is typically accepted by a central bank of issue for any currency in which it may have settlement obligations, but shall not assume the availability of emergency central bank credit as a part of its liquidity plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Liquidity providers. (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, a liquidity provider means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph, a liquidity provider means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A depository institution, a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking organization, a trust company, or a syndicate of depository institutions, U.S. branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations, or trust companies providing a line of credit, foreign exchange swap facility or repurchase facility to a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other counterparty relied upon by a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization to meet its minimum liquidity resources requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In fulfilling its obligations under paragraph (c) of this section, each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall undertake due diligence to confirm that each of its liquidity providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sufficient information to understand and manage the liquidity provider's liquidity risks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The capacity to perform as required under its commitments to provide liquidity to the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where relevant to a liquidity provider's ability reliably to perform its commitments with respect to a particular currency, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization may take into account the liquidity provider's access to the central bank of issue of that currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and

subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall regularly test its procedures for accessing its liquidity resources under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, including testing its arrangements under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) and its relevant liquidity provider(s) under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Documentation of financial resources and liquidity resources. Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall document its supporting rationale for, and have appropriate governance arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and the amount of total liquidity resources it maintains pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
