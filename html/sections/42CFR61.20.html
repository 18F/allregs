Such regulations shall apply to any activity  for which fellowship funds are in fact used, whether within the scope of  the fellowship as approved or otherwise. Appropriate measures shall be  taken by the fellow, the sponsoring institution, and the Surgeon General  to assure that no contracts, assignments, or other arrangements  inconsistent with the fellowship obligation are entered into or  continued and that all personnel involved in the supported activity are  aware of and comply with such obligation. Laboratory notes, related  technical data and information pertaining to inventions or discoveries  shall be maintained for such periods, and filed with or otherwise made  available to the Surgeon General or those whom he may designate at such  times and in such manner as he may determine necessary to comply with  such Department regulations.</p>
