                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Payments under a compensation arrangement are  presumed to be reasonable, and a transfer of property, or the right to  use property, is presumed to be at fair market value, if the following  conditions are satisfied--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for invoking rebuttable presumption--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval  by an authorized body--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. An authorized body means--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The governing body (i.e., the board of directors, board of  trustees, or equivalent controlling body) of the organization;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A committee of the governing body, which may be composed of any  individuals permitted under State law to serve on such a committee, to  the extent that the committee is permitted by State law to act on behalf  of the governing body; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> To the extent permitted under State law, other parties  authorized by the governing body of the organization to act on its  behalf by following procedures specified by the governing body in  approving compensation arrangements or property transfers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals not included on authorized body. For purposes of  determining whether the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section  have been met with respect to a specific compensation arrangement or  property transfer, an individual is not included on the authorized body  when it is reviewing a transaction if that individual meets with other  members only to answer questions, and otherwise recuses himself or  herself from the meeting and is not present during debate and voting on  the compensation arrangement or property transfer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Absence of conflict of interest. A member of the authorized  body does not have a conflict of interest with respect to a compensation  arrangement or property transfer only if the member--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is not a disqualified person participating in or economically  benefitting from the compensation arrangement or property transfer, and  is not a member of the family of any such disqualified person, as  described in section 4958(f)(4) or Sec. 53.4958-3(b)(1);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or  control of any disqualified person participating in or economically  benefitting from the compensation arrangement or property transfer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Does not receive compensation or other payments subject to  approval by any disqualified person participating in or economically  benefitting from the compensation arrangement or property transfer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Has no material financial interest affected by the compensation  arrangement or property transfer; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Does not approve a transaction providing economic benefits to  any disqualified person participating in the compensation arrangement or  property transfer, who in turn has approved or will approve a  transaction providing economic benefits to the member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appropriate data as to comparability--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. An  authorized body has appropriate data as to comparability if, given the  knowledge and expertise of its members, it has information sufficient to  determine whether, under the standards set forth in Sec. 53.4958-4(b),  the compensation arrangement in its entirety is reasonable or the  property transfer is at fair market value. In the case of compensation,  relevant information includes, but is not limited to, compensation  levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both taxable and tax- exempt, for functionally comparable positions; the availability of  similar services in the   geographic area of the applicable tax-exempt organization; current  compensation surveys compiled by independent firms; and actual written  offers from similar institutions competing for the services of the  disqualified person. In the case of property, relevant information  includes, but is not limited to, current independent appraisals of the  value of all property to be transferred; and offers received as part of  an open and competitive bidding process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for compensation paid by small organizations. For  organizations with annual gross receipts (including contributions) of  less than $1 million reviewing compensation arrangements, the authorized  body will be considered to have appropriate data as to comparability if  it has data on compensation paid by three comparable organizations in  the same or similar communities for similar services. No inference is  intended with respect to whether circumstances falling outside this safe  harbor will meet the requirement with respect to the collection of  appropriate data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Application of special rule for small organizations. For  purposes of determining whether the special rule for small organizations  described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies, an  organization may calculate its annual gross receipts based on an average  of its gross receipts during the three prior taxable years. If any  applicable tax-exempt organization is controlled by or controls another  entity (as defined in Sec. 53.4958-4(a)(2)(ii)(B)), the annual gross  receipts of such organizations must be aggregated to determine  applicability of the special rule stated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules for  appropriate data as to comparability for purposes of invoking the  rebuttable presumption of reasonableness described in this section. In  all examples, compensation refers to the aggregate value of all benefits  provided in exchange for services. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Z is a university that is an applicable tax-exempt  organization for purposes of section 4958. Z is negotiating a new  contract with Q, its president, because the old contract will expire at  the end of the year. In setting Q's compensation for its president at  $600x per annum, the executive committee of the Board of Trustees relies  solely on a national survey of compensation for university presidents  that indicates university presidents receive annual compensation in the  range of $100x to $700x; this survey does not divide its data by any  criteria, such as the number of students served by the institution,  annual revenues, academic ranking, or geographic location. Although many  members of the executive committee have significant business experience,  none of the members has any particular expertise in higher education  compensation matters. Given the failure of the survey to provide  information specific to universities comparable to Z, and because no  other information was presented, the executive committee's decision with  respect to Q's compensation was not based upon appropriate data as to  comparability.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. The facts are the same as Example 1, except that the  national compensation survey divides the data regarding compensation for  university presidents into categories based on various university- specific factors, including the size of the institution (in terms of the  number of students it serves and the amount of its revenues) and  geographic area. The survey data shows that university presidents at  institutions comparable to and in the same geographic area as Z receive  annual compensation in the range of $200x to $300x. The executive  committee of the Board of Trustees of Z relies on the survey data and  its evaluation of Q's many years of service as a tenured professor and  high-ranking university official at Z in setting Q's compensation at  $275x annually. The data relied upon by the executive committee  constitutes appropriate data as to comparability.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. X is a tax-exempt hospital that is an applicable tax- exempt organization for purposes of section 4958. Before renewing the  contracts of X's chief executive officer and chief financial officer,  X's governing board commissioned a customized compensation survey from  an independent firm that specializes in consulting on issues related to  executive placement and compensation. The survey covered executives with  comparable responsibilities at a significant number of taxable and tax- exempt hospitals. The survey data are sorted by a number of different  variables, including the size of the hospitals and the nature of the  services they provide, the level of experience and specific  responsibilities of the executives, and the composition of the annual  compensation packages. The board members were provided with the survey  results, a detailed written analysis comparing the hospital's executives  to those covered by the survey, and an opportunity to ask questions of a  member of the firm that prepared the survey. The survey, as prepared   and presented to X's board, constitutes appropriate data as to  comparability.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that one year  later, X is negotiating a new contract with its chief executive officer.  The governing board of X obtains information indicating that the  relevant market conditions have not changed materially, and possesses no  other information indicating that the results of the prior year's survey  are no longer valid. Therefore, X may continue to rely on the  independent compensation survey prepared for the prior year in setting  annual compensation under the new contract.</p><p class="depth4">Example 5. W is a local repertory theater and an applicable tax- exempt organization for purposes of section 4958. W has had annual gross  receipts ranging from $400,000 to $800,000 over its past three taxable  years. In determining the next year's compensation for W's artistic  director, the board of directors of W relies on data compiled from a  telephone survey of three other unrelated performing arts organizations  of similar size in similar communities. A member of the board drafts a  brief written summary of the annual compensation information obtained  from this informal survey. The annual compensation information obtained  in the telephone survey is appropriate data as to comparability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a decision to be documented adequately,  the written or electronic records of the authorized body must note--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The terms of the transaction that was approved and the date it  was approved;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The members of the authorized body who were present during  debate on the transaction that was approved and those who voted on it;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The comparability data obtained and relied upon by the  authorized body and how the data was obtained; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any actions taken with respect to consideration of the  transaction by anyone who is otherwise a member of the authorized body  but who had a conflict of interest with respect to the transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the authorized body determines that reasonable compensation  for a specific arrangement or fair market value in a specific property  transfer is higher or lower than the range of comparability data  obtained, the authorized body must record the basis for its  determination. For a decision to be documented concurrently, records  must be prepared before the later of the next meeting of the authorized  body or 60 days after the final action or actions of the authorized body  are taken. Records must be reviewed and approved by the authorized body  as reasonable, accurate and complete within a reasonable time period  thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No presumption with respect to non-fixed payments until amounts  are determined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)  of this section, in the case of a payment that is not a fixed payment  (within the meaning of Sec. 53.4958-4(a)(3)(ii)), the rebuttable  presumption of this section arises only after the exact amount of the  payment is determined, or a fixed formula for calculating the payment is  specified, and the three requirements for the presumption under  paragraph (a) of this section subsequently are satisfied. See Sec.  53.4958-4(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for certain non-fixed payments subject to a cap. If  the authorized body approves an employment contract with a disqualified  person that includes a non-fixed payment (such as a discretionary bonus)  subject to a specified cap, the authorized body may establish a  rebuttable presumption with respect to the non-fixed payment at the time  the employment contract is entered into if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to approving the contract, the authorized body obtains  appropriate comparability data indicating that a fixed payment of up to  a certain amount to the particular disqualified person would represent  reasonable compensation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum amount payable under the contract (taking into  account both fixed and non-fixed payments) does not exceed the amount  referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The other requirements for the rebuttable presumption of  reasonableness under paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No inference from absence of presumption. The fact that a  transaction between an applicable tax-exempt organization and a  disqualified person is not subject to the presumption described in this  section neither creates any inference that the transaction is   an excess benefit transaction, nor exempts or relieves any person from  compliance with any Federal or state law imposing any obligation, duty,  responsibility, or other standard of conduct with respect to the  operation or administration of any applicable tax-exempt organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Period of reliance on rebuttable presumption. Except as provided  in paragraph (d) of this section with respect to non-fixed payments, the  rebuttable presumption applies to all payments made or transactions  completed in accordance with a contract, provided that the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section were met at the time the parties entered  into the contract.
