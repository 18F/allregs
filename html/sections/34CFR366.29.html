Example: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart, FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the Secretary makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.
