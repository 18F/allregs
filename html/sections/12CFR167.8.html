These generally are strong associations that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well-diversified risks, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, and good earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For all Federal savings associations not meeting the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the minimum leverage capital requirement shall consist of a ratio of core

capital to adjusted total assets of 4 percent. Higher capital ratios may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of an individual Federal savings association. In all cases, Federal savings associations should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks, including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed.</p>
