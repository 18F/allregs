                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory obligation of Medicare supplemental plans to pay. The obligation of a Medicare supplemental plan to pay shall be determined as if the facility of the Uniformed Services were a medicare-eligible provider and the services provided as if they were Medicare-covered services. A Medicare supplemental plan is required to pay only to the extent that the plan would have incurred a payment obligation if the services had been furnished by a Medicare eligible provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inpatient hospital care charges. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 220.8, charges to Medicare supplemental plans for inpatient hospital care services provided to beneficiaries of such plans shall not, for any admission, exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 220.8, charges to Medicare supplemental plans for inpatient hospital care services provided to beneficiaries of such plans shall not, for any admission, exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only one deductible charge shall be made per hospital admission (or Medicare benefit period), regardless of whether the admission is to a facility of the Uniformed Services or a Medicare certified civilian hospital. To ensure that a Medicare supplemental insurer is not charged the inpatient hospital deductible twice when an individual who is entitled to benefits under both DoD retiree benefits and Medicare, the following payment rules apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a dual beneficiary is first admitted to a Medicare-certified hospital and is later admitted to a facility of the Uniformed Services within the same benefit period initiated by the admission to the Medicare-certified hospital, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall not charge the Medicare supplemental insurance plan an inpatient hospital deductible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a dual beneficiary is admitted first to a facility of the Uniformed Services and secondly to a Medicare-certified hospital within 60 days of discharge from the facility of the Uniformed Services, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall refund to the Medicare supplemental insurer any inpatient hospital deductible that the insurer paid to the facility of the Uniformed Services so that it may pay the deductible to the Medicare-certified hospital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charges for Healthcare services other than inpatient deductible amount. (1) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may establish charge amounts for Medicare supplemental plans to collect reasonable charges for inpatient and outpatient copayments

and other services covered by the Medicare supplemental plan. Any such schedule of charge amounts shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may establish charge amounts for Medicare supplemental plans to collect reasonable charges for inpatient and outpatient copayments

and other services covered by the Medicare supplemental plan. Any such schedule of charge amounts shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be based on percentage amounts of the per diem, per visit and other rates established by Sec. 220.8 comparable to the percentage amounts of beneficiary financial responsibility under Medicare for the service involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include adjustments, as appropriate, to identify major components of the all inclusive per diem or per visit rates for which Medicare has special rules.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide for offsets and/or refunds to ensure that Medicare supplemental insurers are not required to pay a limited benefit more than one time in cases in which beneficiaries receive similar services from both a facility of the uniformed services and a Medicare certified provider; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Otherwise conform with the requirements of this section and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If collections are sought under paragraph (c) of this section, the effective date of such collections will be prospective from the date the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections, and will exempt policies in continuous effect without amendment or renewal since the date the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medicare claim not required. Notwithstanding any requirement of the Medicare supplemental plan policy, a Medicare supplemental plan may not refuse payment to a claim made pursuant to this section on the grounds that no claim had previously been submitted by the provider or beneficiary for payment under the Medicare program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exclusion of Medicare supplemental plans prior to November 5, 1990. This section is not applicable to Medicare supplemental plans:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That have been in continuous effect without amendment since prior to November 5, 1990; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For which the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other authorized representative of the United States) makes a determination, based on documentation provided by the Medicare supplemental plan, that the plan agreement clearly excludes payment for services covered by this section. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after November 5, 1990, are subject to this section, as are prior plans that do not clearly exclude payment for services covered by this section.
