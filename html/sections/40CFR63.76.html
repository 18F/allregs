                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pursuant to the procedures of this section, the appropriate  reviewing agency shall review and approve or disapprove base year  emission data submitted in an enforceable commitment under Sec. 63.75 or  in a request letter from an applicant that wishes to participate in the  early reduction program but who is not required to submit an enforceable  commitment. For review requests submitted to a State agency as the  appropriate reviewing agency, a copy of the request also shall be  submitted to the applicable EPA Regional Office. For review requests  submitted to the EPA Regional Office as the appropriate reviewing  agency, a copy of the request also shall be sent to the applicable State  agency. Copies also shall be submitted to the EPA Stationary Source  Compliance Division (EN-341W), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington,  DC 20460 and the EPA Emission Standards Division (MD-13), Research  Triangle Park, NC 27711; to the attention of the Early Reductions  Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 30 days of receipt of an enforceable commitment or base  year emission data, the reviewing agency shall advise the applicant  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The base year emission data are complete as submitted; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The base year emission data are not complete and include a list  of deficiencies that must be corrected before review can proceed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA will publish a notice in the Federal Register which contains  a list, accumulated for the previous month, of the sources for which  complete base year emission data have been submitted and which are  undergoing review either in the EPA Regional Office or a State agency  within the EPA region. The notice will contain the name and location of  each source and a contract in the EPA Regional Office for additional  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 60 days of a determination that a base year emission data  submission is complete, the reviewing agency shall evaluate the adequacy  of the submission with respect to the requirements of Sec. 63.74 (b) and  (c) and either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine to approve the submission and publish a notice in a  newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located  or in a State publication designed to give general public notice,  providing the aggregate base year emission data for the source and the  rationale for the proposed approval, noting the availability of the  nonconfidential information contained in the submission for public  inspection in at least one location in the community in which the source  is located, providing for a public hearing upon request by an interested  party, and establishing a 30 day public comment period that can be  extended to 60 days upon request by an interested party; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine to disapprove the base year emission data and give  notice to the applicant of the reasons for the disapproval. An applicant  may correct disapproved base year data and submit revised data for  review in accordance with this subsection, except that the review of a  revision shall be accomplished within 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If no adverse public comments are received by the reviewing  agency on proposed base year data for a source, the data shall be  considered approved at the close of the public comment period and a  notice of the approval shall be sent to the applicant and published by  the reviewing agency by advertisement in the area affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency agrees  that corrections are needed, the reviewing agency shall give notice to  the applicant of the disapproval and reasons for the disapproval. An  applicant may correct disapproved base year emission data and submit  revised emission data. If a revision is submitted by the applicant that,  to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency, takes into account the  adverse comments, the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in  the area affected a notice containing the approved base year emission  data for the source and send notice of the approval to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency  determines   that the comments do not warrant changes to the base year emission data,  the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in the area affected  a notice containing the approved base year emission data for the source  and the reasons for not accepting the adverse comments. A notice of the  approval also shall be sent to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If an applicant submits revised emission data under paragraph  (d)(2) or (f) of this section for a source subject to an enforceable  commitment, the applicant also shall submit an amended enforceable  commitment which takes into account the revised base year emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If revised base year emission data are not submitted or notice  of intent to submit revised data is not provided to the permitting  authority by an applicant within 90 days of receiving adverse comments  or a notice of disapproved base year emission data for a source that is  subject to an enforceable commitment, the enforceable commitment shall  be considered withdrawn and a notice to that effect shall be sent by the  reviewing agency to the applicant.</p>
