Such criteria must be based on sound scientific rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use.

States must review water quality data and information on discharges to identify specific water bodies where toxic pollutants may be adversely affecting water quality or the attainment of the designated water use or where the levels of toxic pollutants are at a level to warrant concern and must adopt criteria for such toxic pollutants applicable to the water body sufficient to protect the designated use. Where a State adopts narrative criteria for toxic pollutants to protect designated uses, the State must provide information identifying the method by which the State intends to regulate point source discharges of toxic pollutants on water quality limited segments based on such narrative criteria. Such information may be included as part of the standards or may be included in documents generated by the State in response to the Water Quality Planning and Management Regulations (40 CFR part 35).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Form of criteria: In establishing criteria, States should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish numerical values based on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 304(a) Guidance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 304(a) Guidance modified to reflect site-specific conditions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other scientifically defensible methods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establish narrative criteria or criteria based upon biomonitoring methods where numerical criteria cannot be established or to supplement numerical criteria.</p>
