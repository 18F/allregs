handicap requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When offering an accessible unit to an applicant not having handicaps requiring the accessibility features of the unit, the owner or manager may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessible unit when available.</p>
