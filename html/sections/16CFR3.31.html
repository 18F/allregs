                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discovery methods. Parties may obtain discovery by one or more  of the following methods: Depositions upon oral examination or written  questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things  for inspection and other purposes; and requests for admission. Except as  provided in the rules, or unless the Administrative Law Judge orders  otherwise, the frequency or sequence of these methods is not limited.  The parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, conduct discovery  simultaneously; the fact that a party is conducting discovery shall not  operate to delay any other party's discovery. Unless all parties  expressly agree otherwise, no discovery shall take place before the  issuance of a prehearing scheduling order under Sec. 3.21(c), except  for the mandatory initial disclosures required by paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory initial disclosures. Complaint counsel and  respondent's counsel   shall, within 5 days of receipt of a respondent's answer to the  complaint and without awaiting a discovery request, provide to each  other:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, privileged as  defined in Sec. 3.31(c)(4), pertain to hearing preparation as defined  in Sec. 3.31(c)(5), pertain to experts as defined in Sec. 3.31A, or  are obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less  burdensome, or less expensive. A party shall make its disclosures based  on the information then reasonably available to it and is not excused  from making its disclosures because it has not fully completed its  investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope of discovery. Unless otherwise limited by order of the  Administrative Law Judge or the Commission in accordance with these  rules, the scope of discovery under all the rules in this part is as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Parties may obtain discovery to the extent that it  may be reasonably expected to yield information relevant to the  allegations of the complaint, to the proposed relief, or to the defenses  of any respondent. Such information may include the existence,  description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books,  documents, other tangible things, electronically stored information, and  the identity and location of persons having any knowledge of any  discoverable matter. Information may not be withheld from discovery on  grounds that the information will be inadmissible at the hearing if the  information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. Complaint counsel need only search for materials  that were collected or reviewed in the course of the investigation of  the matter or prosecution of the case and that are in the possession,  custody or control of the Bureaus or Offices of the Commission that  investigated the matter, including the Bureau of Economics. The  Administrative Law Judge may authorize for good cause additional  discovery of materials in the possession, custody, or control of those  Bureaus or Offices, or authorize other discovery pursuant to Sec. 3.36.  Neither complaint counsel, respondent, nor a third party receiving a  discovery request under these rules is required to search for materials  generated and transmitted between an entity's counsel (including  counsel's legal staff or in-house counsel) and not shared with anyone  else, or between complaint counsel and non-testifying Commission  employees, unless the Administrative Law Judge determines there is good  cause to provide such materials. The frequency or extent of use of the  discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules shall be limited  by the Administrative Law Judge if he or she determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The discovery sought from a party or third party is unreasonably  cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that  is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by  discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The burden and expense of the proposed discovery on a party or  third party outweigh its likely benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronically stored information. A party or third party need  not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources  that the party or third party identifies as not reasonably accessible  because of undue burden or cost. On a motion to compel discovery, the  party or third party from whom discovery is sought must show that the  information is not reasonably   accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the  Administrative Law Judge may nonetheless order discovery if the  requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of  paragraph (c)(2). The Administrative Law Judge may specify conditions  for the discovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Privilege. Discovery shall be denied or limited in order to  preserve the privilege of a witness, person, or governmental agency as  governed by the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the  principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the  Commission in the light of reason and experience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Hearing preparations: Materials. Subject to the provisions of  Sec. 3.31A, a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible  things otherwise discoverable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and  prepared in anticipation of litigation or for hearing by or for another  party or by or for that other party's representative (including the  party's attorney, consultant, or agent) only upon a showing that the  party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the  preparation of its case and that the party is unable without undue  hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other  means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing  has been made, the Administrative Law Judge shall protect against  disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal  theories of an attorney or other representative of a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Protective orders; orders to preserve evidence. In order to  protect the parties and third parties against improper use and  disclosure of confidential information, the Administrative Law Judge  shall issue a protective order as set forth in the appendix to this  section. The Administrative Law Judge may also deny discovery or make  any other order which justice requires to protect a party or other  person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or  expense, or to prevent undue delay in the proceeding. Such an order may  also be issued to preserve evidence upon a showing that there is  substantial reason to believe that such evidence would not otherwise be  available for presentation at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Supplementation of disclosures and responses. A party who has  made a mandatory initial disclosure under Sec. 3.31(b) or responded to  a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to  supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information  thereafter acquired if ordered by the Administrative Law Judge or in the  following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals  its mandatory initial disclosures under Sec. 3.31(b) if the party  learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is  incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information  has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the  discovery process or in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party is under a duty to amend in a timely manner a prior  response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for  admission if the party learns that the response is in some material  respect incomplete or incorrect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Stipulations. When approved by the Administrative Law Judge, the  parties may by written stipulation (1) provide that depositions may be  taken before any person, at any time or place, upon any notice, and in  any manner and when so taken may be used like other depositions, and (2)  modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods of  discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disclosure of privileged or protected information or  communications; scope of waiver; obligations of receiving party. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  The disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications  during a part 3 proceeding or during a Commission precomplaint  investigation shall not operate as a waiver if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The disclosure is inadvertent;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps  to prevent disclosure; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error,  including notifying any party that received the information or  communication of the claim and the basis for it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After being notified, the receiving party must promptly return,  sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has;  must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved;  must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party  disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the  information to the Administrative Law Judge under seal for a  determination of the claim. The producing party must preserve the  information until the claim is resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The disclosure of privileged or protected information or  communications during a part 3 proceeding or during a Commission  precomplaint investigation shall waive the privilege or protection as to  undisclosed information or communications only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The waiver is intentional;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disclosed and undisclosed information or communications  concern the same subject matter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> They ought in fairness to be considered together.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Restriction on filings. Unless otherwise ordered by the  Administrative Law Judge in his or her discretion, mandatory initial and  supplemental disclosures, interrogatories, depositions, requests for  documents, requests for admissions, and answers and responses thereto  shall be served upon other parties but shall not be filed with the  Office of the Secretary, the Administrative Law Judge, or otherwise  provided to the Commission, except to support or oppose a motion or to  offer as evidence.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec. 3.31: Standard Protective Order.</p><p class="depth0">For the purpose of protecting the interests of the parties and third  parties in the above-captioned matter against improper use and  disclosure of confidential information submitted or produced in  connection with this matter:</p><p class="depth0">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT this Protective Order Governing  Confidential Material (``Protective Order'') shall govern the handling  of all Discovery Material, as hereafter defined.</p><p class="depth0">1. As used in this Order, ``confidential material'' shall refer to  any document or portion thereof that contains privileged information,  competitively sensitive information, or sensitive personal information.  ``Sensitive personal information'' shall refer to, but shall not be  limited to, an individual's Social Security number, taxpayer  identification number, financial account number, credit card or debit  card number, driver's license number, state-issued identification  number, passport number, date of birth (other than year), and any  sensitive health information identifiable by individual, such as an  individual's medical records. ``Document'' shall refer to any  discoverable writing, recording, transcript of oral testimony, or  electronically stored information in the possession of a party or a  third party. ``Commission'' shall refer to the Federal Trade Commission  (``FTC''), or any of its employees, agents, attorneys, and all other  persons acting on its behalf, excluding persons retained as consultants  or experts for purposes of this proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">2. Any document or portion thereof submitted by a respondent or a  third party during a Federal Trade Commission investigation or during  the course of this proceeding that is entitled to confidentiality under  the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other federal statute or  regulation, or under any federal court or Commission precedent  interpreting such statute or regulation, as well as any information that  discloses the substance of the contents of any confidential materials  derived from a document subject to this Order, shall be treated as  confidential material for purposes of this Order. The identity of a  third party submitting such confidential material shall also be treated  as confidential material for the purposes of this Order where the  submitter has requested such confidential treatment.</p><p class="depth0">3. The parties and any third parties, in complying with informal  discovery requests, disclosure requirements, or discovery demands in  this proceeding may designate any responsive document or portion thereof  as confidential material, including documents obtained by them from  third parties pursuant to discovery or as otherwise obtained.</p><p class="depth0">4. The parties, in conducting discovery from third parties, shall  provide to each third party a copy of this Order so as to inform each  such third party of his, her, or its rights herein.</p><p class="depth0">5. A designation of confidentiality shall constitute a  representation in good faith and after careful determination that the  material is not reasonably believed to be already in the public domain  and that counsel believes the material so designated constitutes  confidential material as defined in Paragraph 1 of this Order.</p><p class="depth0">6. Material may be designated as confidential by placing on or  affixing to the document containing such material (in such manner as  will not interfere with the legibility thereof), or if an entire folder  or box of documents is confidential by placing or affixing to that  folder or box, the designation ``CONFIDENTIAL--FTC Docket No. XXXX'' or   any other appropriate notice that identifies this proceeding, together  with an indication of the portion or portions of the document considered  to be confidential material. Confidential information contained in  electronic documents may also be designated as confidential by placing  the designation ``CONFIDENTIAL--FTC Docket No. XXXX'' or any other  appropriate notice that identifies this proceeding, on the face of the  CD or DVD or other medium on which the document is produced. Masked or  otherwise redacted copies of documents may be produced where the  portions masked or redacted contain privileged matter, provided that the  copy produced shall indicate at the appropriate point that portions have  been masked or redacted and the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth0">7. Confidential material shall be disclosed only to: (a) the  Administrative Law Judge presiding over this proceeding, personnel  assisting the Administrative Law Judge, the Commission and its  employees, and personnel retained by the Commission as experts or  consultants for this proceeding; (b) judges and other court personnel of  any court having jurisdiction over any appellate proceedings involving  this matter; (c) outside counsel of record for any respondent, their  associated attorneys and other employees of their law firm(s), provided  they are not employees of a respondent; (d) anyone retained to assist  outside counsel in the preparation or hearing of this proceeding  including consultants, provided they are not affiliated in any way with  a respondent and have signed an agreement to abide by the terms of the  protective order; and (e) any witness or deponent who may have authored  or received the information in question.</p><p class="depth0">8. Disclosure of confidential material to any person described in  Paragraph 7 of this Order shall be only for the purposes of the  preparation and hearing of this proceeding, or any appeal therefrom, and  for no other purpose whatsoever, provided, however, that the Commission  may, subject to taking appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality  of such material, use or disclose confidential material as provided by  its Rules of Practice; sections 6(f) and 21 of the Federal Trade  Commission Act; or any other legal obligation imposed upon the  Commission.</p><p class="depth0">9. In the event that any confidential material is contained in any  pleading, motion, exhibit or other paper filed or to be filed with the  Secretary of the Commission, the Secretary shall be so informed by the  Party filing such papers, and such papers shall be filed in camera. To  the extent that such material was originally submitted by a third party,  the party including the materials in its papers shall immediately notify  the submitter of such inclusion. Confidential material contained in the  papers shall continue to have in camera treatment until further order of  the Administrative Law Judge, provided, however, that such papers may be  furnished to persons or entities who may receive confidential material  pursuant to Paragraphs 7 or 8. Upon or after filing any paper containing  confidential material, the filing party shall file on the public record  a duplicate copy of the paper that does not reveal confidential  material. Further, if the protection for any such material expires, a  party may file on the public record a duplicate copy which also contains  the formerly protected material.</p><p class="depth0">10. If counsel plans to introduce into evidence at the hearing any  document or transcript containing confidential material produced by  another party or by a third party, they shall provide advance notice to  the other party or third party for purposes of allowing that party to  seek an order that the document or transcript be granted in camera  treatment. If that party wishes in camera treatment for the document or  transcript, the party shall file an appropriate motion with the  Administrative Law Judge within 5 days after it receives such notice.  Except where such an order is granted, all documents and transcripts  shall be part of the public record. Where in camera treatment is  granted, a duplicate copy of such document or transcript with the  confidential material deleted therefrom may be placed on the public  record.</p><p class="depth0">11. If any party receives a discovery request in any investigation  or in any other proceeding or matter that may require the disclosure of  confidential material submitted by another party or third party, the  recipient of the discovery request shall promptly notify the submitter  of receipt of such request. Unless a shorter time is mandated by an  order of a court, such notification shall be in writing and be received  by the submitter at least 10 business days before production, and shall  include a copy of this Protective Order and a cover letter that will  apprise the submitter of its rights hereunder. Nothing herein shall be  construed as requiring the recipient of the discovery request or anyone  else covered by this Order to challenge or appeal any order requiring  production of confidential material, to subject itself to any penalties  for non-compliance with any such order, or to seek any relief from the  Administrative Law Judge or the Commission. The recipient shall not  oppose the submitter's efforts to challenge the disclosure of  confidential material. In addition, nothing herein shall limit the  applicability of Rule 4.11(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 16  CFR 4.11(e), to discovery requests in another proceeding that are  directed to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">12. At the time that any consultant or other person retained to  assist counsel in the preparation of this action concludes participation  in the action, such person shall return to counsel all copies of  documents or portions thereof designated confidential that   are in the possession of such person, together with all notes, memoranda  or other papers containing confidential information. At the conclusion  of this proceeding, including the exhaustion of judicial review, the  parties shall return documents obtained in this action to their  submitters, provided, however, that the Commission's obligation to  return documents shall be governed by the provisions of Rule 4.12 of the  Rules of Practice, 16 CFR 4.12.</p><p class="depth0">13. The provisions of this Protective Order, insofar as they  restrict the communication and use of confidential discovery material,  shall, without written permission of the submitter or further order of  the Commission, continue to be binding after the conclusion of this  proceeding.  [74 FR 1824, Jan. 13, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 20309, May 1, 2009; 76  FR 52251, 52252, Aug. 22, 2011]    Sec. 3.31A  Expert discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(4)</em>, and  discovery for purposes of authenticity and admissibility of exhibits.  Complaint counsel shall serve the other parties with a report prepared  by each of its expert witnesses not later than 14 days after the close  of fact discovery. Each respondent shall serve each other party with a  report prepared by each of its expert witnesses not later than 14 days  after the deadline for service of complaint counsel's expert reports.  Complaint counsel shall serve respondents with a list of any rebuttal  expert witnesses and a rebuttal report prepared by each such witness not  later than 10 days after the deadline for service of respondent's expert  reports. Aside from any information required by paragraph (c), a  rebuttal report shall be limited to rebuttal of matters set forth in a  respondent's expert reports. If material outside the scope of fair  rebuttal is presented, a respondent may file a motion not later than 5  days after the deadline for service of complaint counsel's rebuttal  reports, seeking appropriate relief with the Administrative Law Judge,  including striking all or part of the report, leave to submit a  surrebuttal report by respondent's experts, or leave to call a  surrebuttal witness and to submit a surrebuttal report by that witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No party may call an expert witness at the hearing unless he or  she has been listed and has provided reports as required by this  section. Each side will be limited to calling at the evidentiary hearing  5 expert witnesses, including any rebuttal or surrebuttal expert  witnesses. A party may file a motion seeking leave to call additional  expert witnesses due to extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each report shall be signed by the expert and contain a complete  statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons  therefor; the data, materials, or other information considered by the  witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of  or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the witness,  including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the  preceding 10 years; the compensation to be paid for the study and  testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has  testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding 4  years. A rebuttal or surrebuttal report need not include any information  already included in the initial report of the witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A party may depose any person who has been identified as an  expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. Unless otherwise  ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, a deposition of any expert  witness shall be conducted after the disclosure of a report prepared by  the witness in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.  Depositions of expert witnesses shall be completed not later than 65  days after the close of fact discovery. Upon motion, the Administrative  Law Judge may order further discovery by other means, subject to such  restrictions as to scope as the Administrative Law Judge may deem  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A party may not discover facts known or opinions held by an  expert who has been retained or specifically employed by another party  in anticipation of litigation or preparation for hearing and who is not  listed as a witness for the evidentiary hearing. A party may not  discover drafts of any   report required by this section, regardless of the form in which the  draft is recorded, or any communications between another party's  attorney and any of that other party's testifying experts, regardless of  the form of the communications, except to the extent that the  communications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relate to compensation for the expert's study or testimony;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify facts or data that the other party's attorney provided  and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify assumptions that the other party's attorney provided  and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may, upon a finding of good cause,  alter the pre-hearing schedule set forth in this section; provided,  however, that no such alteration shall affect the date of the  evidentiary hearing noticed in the complaint.
