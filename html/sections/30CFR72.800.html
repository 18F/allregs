                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary will use a single, full-shift measurement of  respirable coal mine dust to determine the average concentration on a  shift since that measurement accurately represents atmospheric  conditions to which a miner is exposed during such shift. Noncompliance  with the applicable respirable dust standard or the applicable  respirable dust standard when quartz is present, in accordance with  subchapter O of this chapter, is demonstrated when a single, full-shift  measurement taken by MSHA meets or exceeds the applicable ECV in Table  70-1, 71-1, or 90-1 that corresponds to the applicable standard and the  particular sampling device used. Upon issuance of a citation for a  violation of the applicable standard, and for MSHA to terminate the  citation, the operator shall take the specified actions in subchapter O  of this chapter.
