A state,  through an official having primary enforcement or interpretative  responsibilities for the state consumer leasing law, may apply to the  Bureau for a preemption determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application. A state may apply to the Bureau for  an   exemption from the requirements of the Act and this part for any class  of lease transactions within the state. The Bureau will grant such an  exemption if the Bureau determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The class of leasing transactions is subject to state law  requirements substantially similar to the Act and this part or that  lessees are afforded greater protection under state law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is adequate provision for state enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enforcement and liability. After an exemption has been granted,  the requirements of the applicable state law (except for additional  requirements not imposed by Federal law) will constitute the  requirements of the Act and this part. No exemption will extend to the  civil liability provisions of sections 130, 131, and 185 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The commentary in Supplement I is the vehicle by  which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues official  interpretations of Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013). Good faith  compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under  section 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1640(f)). Section  130(f) protects lessors from civil liability for any act done or omitted  in good faith in conformity with any interpretation issued by the  Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedures for requesting interpretations. Under appendix C of  Regulation M, anyone may request an official interpretation.  Interpretations that are adopted will be incorporated in this commentary  following publication in the Federal Register. No official  interpretations are expected to be issued other than by means of this  commentary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Comment designations. Each comment in the commentary is  identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that it  interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as  possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For  example, some of the comments to Sec. 1013.4(f) are further divided by  subparagraph, such as comment 4(f)(1)-1 and comment 4(f)(2)-1. In other  cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for  example, as comment 4(a)-1. This introduction may be cited as comments  I-1 through I-4. An appendix may be cited as comment app. A-1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Illustrations. Lists that appear in the commentary may be  exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear  from the context. Illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as  ``including,'' ``such as,'' ``to illustrate,'' and ``for example.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.1--Authority, Scope, Purpose, and Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">1. Foreign applicability. Regulation M applies to all persons  (including branches of foreign banks or leasing companies located in the  United States) that offer consumer leases to residents of any state  (including foreign nationals) as defined in Sec. 1013.2(p), except  persons excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the  Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124  Stat. 1376. The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S.  bank or to a leasing company leasing to a U.S. citizen residing or  visiting abroad or to a foreign national abroad.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.2--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">2(b) Advertisement</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The term advertisement includes messages inviting,  offering, or otherwise generally announcing to prospective customers the  availability of consumer leases, whether in visual, oral, print or  electronic media. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Messages in newspapers, magazines, leaflets, catalogs, and  fliers.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Messages on radio, television, and public address systems.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Direct mail literature.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Printed material on any interior or exterior sign or display, in  any window display, in any point-of-transaction literature or price tag  that is delivered or made available to a lessee or prospective lessee in  any manner whatsoever.</p><p class="depth0">v. Telephone solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Online messages, such as those on the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The term does not apply to the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Direct personal contacts, including follow-up letters, cost  estimates for individual lessees, or oral or written communications  relating to the negotiation of a specific transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Informational material distributed only to businesses.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Notices required by Federal or state law, if the law mandates  that specific information be displayed and only the mandated information  is included in the notice.</p><p class="depth0">iv. News articles controlled by the news medium.</p><p class="depth0">v. Market research or educational materials that do not solicit  business.</p><p class="depth0">3. Persons covered. See the commentary to Sec. 1013.7(a).</p><p class="depth0">2(d) Closed-End Lease</p><p class="depth0">1. General. In closed-end leases, sometimes referred to as ``walk- away'' leases, the lessee is not responsible for the residual value of   the leased property at the end of the lease term.</p><p class="depth0">2(e) Consumer Lease</p><p class="depth0">1. Primary purposes. A lessor must determine in each case if the  leased property will be used primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes. If a question exists as to the primary purpose for a  lease, the fact that a lessor gives disclosures is not controlling on  the question of whether the transaction is covered. The primary purpose  of a lease is determined before or at consummation and a lessor need not  provide Regulation M disclosures where there is a subsequent change in  the primary use.</p><p class="depth0">2. Period of time. To be a consumer lease, the initial term of the  lease must be more than four months. Thus, a lease of personal property  for four months, three months or on a month-to-month or week-to-week  basis (even though the lease actually extends beyond four months) is not  a consumer lease and is not subject to the disclosure requirements of  the regulation. However, a lease that imposes a penalty for not  continuing the lease beyond four months is considered to have a term of  more than four months. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. A three-month lease extended on a month-to-month basis and  terminated after one year is not subject to the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A month-to-month lease with a penalty, such as the forfeiture of  a security deposit for terminating before one year, is subject to the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Total contractual obligation. The total contractual obligation is  not necessarily the same as the total of payments disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(e). The total contractual obligation includes nonrefundable  amounts a lessee is contractually obligated to pay to the lessor, but  excludes items such as:</p><p class="depth0">i. Residual value amounts or purchase-option prices;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Amounts collected by the lessor but paid to a third party, such  as taxes, licenses, and registration fees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit sale. The regulation does not cover a lease that meets the  definition of a credit sale in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.2(a)(16), which  is defined, in part, as a bailment or lease (unless terminable without  penalty at any time by the consumer) under which the consumer:</p><p class="depth0">i. Agrees to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially  equivalent to, or in excess of, the total value of the property and  services involved; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Will become (or has the option to become), for no additional  consideration or for nominal consideration, the owner of the property  upon compliance with the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">5. Agricultural purpose. Agricultural purpose means a purpose  related to the production, harvest, exhibition, marketing,  transportation, processing, or manufacture of agricultural products by a  natural person who cultivates, plants, propagates, or nurtures those  agricultural products, including but not limited to the acquisition of  personal property and services used primarily in farming. Agricultural  products include horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products,  livestock, wildlife, poultry, bees, forest products, fish and shellfish,  and any products thereof, including processed and manufactured products,  and any and all products raised or produced on farms and any processed  or manufactured products thereof.</p><p class="depth0">6. Organization or other entity. A consumer lease does not include a  lease made to an organization such as a corporation or a government  agency or instrumentality. Such a lease is not covered by the regulation  even if the leased property is used (by an employee, for example)  primarily for personal, family or household purposes, or is guaranteed  by or subsequently assigned to a natural person.</p><p class="depth0">7. Leases of personal property incidental to a service. The  following leases of personal property are deemed incidental to a service  and thus are not subject to the regulation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Home entertainment systems requiring the consumer to lease  equipment that enables a television to receive the transmitted  programming.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Security alarm systems requiring the installation of leased  equipment intended to monitor unlawful entries into a home and in some  cases to provide fire protection.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Propane gas service where the consumer must lease a propane  tank to receive the service.</p><p class="depth0">8. Safe deposit boxes. The lease of a safe deposit box is not a  consumer lease under Sec. 1013.2(e).</p><p class="depth0">9. Threshold amount. A consumer lease is exempt from the  requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds  the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. The  threshold amount in effect during a particular time period is the amount  stated below for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective  January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer  Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was  in effect on the preceding June 1. This comment will be amended to  provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual  percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes  available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the  nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase  in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount,  the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual  percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the  threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by   $900. If a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part  because the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in  effect at the time of consummation, the lease remains exempt regardless  of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount.</p><p class="depth0">i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. From July 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the threshold  amount is $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">iii. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the threshold  amount is $51,800.</p><p class="depth0">iv. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the threshold  amount is $53,000.</p><p class="depth0">v. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the threshold  amount is $53,500.</p><p class="depth0">vi. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold  amount is $54,600.</p><p class="depth0">2(g) Lessee</p><p class="depth0">1. Guarantors. Guarantors are not lessees for purposes of the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2(h) Lessor</p><p class="depth0">1. Arranger of a lease. To ``arrange'' for the lease of personal  property means to provide or offer to provide a lease that is or will be  extended by another person under a business or other relationship  pursuant to which the person arranging the lease (a) receives or will  receive a fee, compensation, or other consideration for the service or  (b) has knowledge of the lease terms and participates in the preparation  of the contract documents required in connection with the lease. To  illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. An entity that, pursuant to a business relationship, completes  the necessary lease agreement before forwarding it for execution to the  leasing company (to whom the obligation is payable on its face) is  ``arranging'' for the lease.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An entity that, without receiving a fee for the service, refers  a customer to a leasing company that will prepare all relevant contract  documents is not ``arranging'' for the lease.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consideration. The term ``other consideration'' as used in  comment 2(h)-1 refers to an actual payment corresponding to a fee or  similar compensation and not to intangible benefits, such as the  advantage of increased business, which may flow from the relationship  between the parties.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assignees. An assignee may be a lessor for purposes of the  regulation in circumstances where the assignee has substantial  involvement in the lease transaction. See cf. Ford Motor Credit Co. v.  Cenance, 452 U.S. 155 (1981) (held that an assignee was a creditor for  purposes of the pre-1980 Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z because  of its substantial involvement in the credit transaction).</p><p class="depth0">4. Multiple lessors. See the commentary to Sec. 1013.3(c).</p><p class="depth0">2(j) Organization</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The term ``organization'' includes joint ventures and  persons operating under a business name.</p><p class="depth0">2(l) Personal Property</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Whether property is personal property depends on state  or other applicable law. For example, a mobile home or houseboat may be  considered personal property in one state but real property in another.</p><p class="depth0">2(m) Realized Value</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Realized value refers to either the retail or wholesale  value of the leased property at early termination or at the end of the  lease term. It is not a required disclosure. Realized value is relevant  only to leases in which the lessee's liability at early termination or  at the end of the lease term typically is based on the difference  between the residual value (or the adjusted lease balance) of the leased  property and its realized value.</p><p class="depth0">2. Options. Subject to the contract and to state or other applicable  law, the lessor may calculate the realized value in determining the  lessee's liability at the end of the lease term or at early termination  in one of the three ways stated in Sec. 1013.2(m). If the lessor sells  the property prior to making the determination about liability, the  price received for the property (or the fair market value) is the  realized value. If the lessor does not sell the property prior to making  that determination, the highest offer or the fair market value is the  realized value.</p><p class="depth0">3. Determination of realized value. Disposition charges are not  subtracted in determining the realized value but amounts attributable to  taxes may be subtracted.</p><p class="depth0">4. Offers. In determining the highest offer for disposition, the  lessor may disregard offers that an offeror has withdrawn or is unable  or unwilling to perform.</p><p class="depth0">5. Lessor's appraisal. See commentary to Sec. 1013.4(l).</p><p class="depth0">2(o) Security Interest and Security</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosable interests. For purposes of disclosure, a security  interest is an interest taken by the lessor to secure performance of the  lessee's obligation. For example, if a bank that is not a lessor makes a  loan to a leasing company and takes assignments of consumer leases  generated by that company to secure the loan, the bank's security  interest in the lessor's receivables is not a security interest for  purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">2. General coverage. An interest the lessor may have in leased  property must be disclosed only if it is considered a security interest  under state or other applicable law.   The term includes, but is not limited to, security interests under the  Uniform Commercial Code; real property mortgages, deeds of trust, and  other consensual or confessed liens whether or not recorded; mechanic's,  materialman's, artisan's, and other similar liens; vendor's liens in  both real and personal property; liens on property arising by operation  of law; and any interest in a lease when used to secure payment or  performance of an obligation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance exception. The lessor's right to insurance proceeds or  unearned insurance premiums is not a security interest for purposes of  this part.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.3--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">3(a) General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis of disclosures. Disclosures must reflect the terms of the  legal obligation between the parties. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. In a three-year lease with no penalty for termination after a  one-year minimum term, disclosures are based on the full three-year term  of the lease. The one-year minimum term is only relevant to the early  termination provisions of Sec. Sec. 1013.4 (g)(1), (k) and (l).</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard. The clear and conspicuous  standard requires that disclosures be reasonably understandable. For  example, the disclosures must be presented in a way that does not  obscure the relationship of the terms to each other; appendix A of this  part contains model forms that meet this standard. In addition, although  no minimum typesize is required, the disclosures must be legible,  whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multipurpose disclosure forms. A lessor may use a multipurpose  disclosure form provided the lessor is able to designate the specific  disclosures applicable to a given transaction, consistent with the  requirement that disclosures be clearly and conspicuously provided.</p><p class="depth0">4. Number of transactions. Lessors have flexibility in handling  lease transactions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. When a lessor leases two items to the same lessee on the same  day, the lessor may disclose the leases as either one or two lease  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When a lessor sells insurance or other incidental services in  connection with a lease, the lessor may disclose in one of two ways: As  a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation  Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. When a lessor includes an outstanding lease or credit balance  in a lease transaction, the lessor may disclose the outstanding balance  as part of a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not  Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a  credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3(a)(1) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Cross-references. Lessors may include in the nonsegregated  disclosures a cross-reference to items in the segregated disclosures  rather than repeat those items. A lessor may include in the segregated  disclosures numeric or alphabetic designations as cross-references to  related information so long as such references do not obscure or detract  from the segregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification of parties. While disclosures must be made clearly  and conspicuously, lessors are not required to use the word ``lessor''  and ``lessee'' to identify the parties to the lease transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Lessor's address. The lessor must be identified by name; an  address (and telephone number) may be provided.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multiple lessors and lessees. In transactions involving multiple  lessors and multiple lessees, a single lessor may make all the  disclosures to a single lessee as long as the disclosure statement  identifies all the lessors and lessees.</p><p class="depth0">5. Lessee's signature. The regulation does not require that the  lessee sign the disclosure statement, whether disclosures are separately  provided or are part of the lease contract. Nevertheless, to provide  evidence that disclosures are given before a lessee becomes obligated on  the lease transaction, the lessor may, for example, ask the lessee to  sign the disclosure statement or an acknowledgement of receipt, may  place disclosures that are included in the lease documents above the  lessee's signature, or include instructions alerting a lessee to read  the disclosures prior to signing the lease.</p><p class="depth0">3(a)(2) Segregation of Certain Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Location. The segregated disclosures referred to in  Sec. 1013.3(a)(2) may be provided on a separate document and the other  required disclosures may be provided in the lease contract, so long as  all disclosures are given at the same time. Alternatively, all  disclosures may be provided in a separate document or in the lease  contract.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional information among segregated disclosures. The  disclosures required to be segregated may contain only the information  required or permitted to be included among the segregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Substantially similar. See commentary to appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">3(a)(3) Timing of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation. When a contractual relationship is created between  the lessor and the lessee is a matter to be determined under state or  other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">3(b) Additional Information; Nonsegregated Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. State law disclosures. A lessor may include in the nonsegregated  disclosures any state law disclosures that are not inconsistent with the  Act and regulation under Sec. 1013.9 as long as, in accordance with the  standard set forth in Sec. 1013.3(b) for additional information, the  state law disclosures are not used or placed to mislead or confuse or  detract from any disclosure required by the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3(c) Multiple Lessors or Lessees</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple lessors. If a single lessor provides disclosures to a  lessee on behalf of several lessors, all disclosures for the transaction  must be given, even if the lessor making the disclosures would not  otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">3(d) Use of Estimates</p><p class="depth0">1. Time of estimated disclosure. The lessor may, after making a  reasonable effort to obtain information, use estimates to make  disclosures if necessary information is unknown or unavailable at the  time the disclosures are made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Basis of estimates. Estimates must be made on the basis of the  best information reasonably available at the time disclosures are made.  The ``reasonably available'' standard requires that the lessor, acting  in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The  lessor may rely on the representations of other parties. For example,  the lessor might look to the consumer to determine the purpose for which  leased property will be used, to insurance companies for the cost of  insurance, or to an automobile manufacturer or dealer for the date of  delivery. See commentary to Sec. 1013.4(n) for estimating official fees  and taxes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Residual value of leased property at termination. In an open-end  lease where the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term is based  on the residual value of the leased property as determined at  consummation, the estimate of the residual value must be reasonable and  based on the best information reasonably available to the lessor (see  Sec. 1013.4(m)). A lessor should generally use an accepted trade  publication listing estimated current or future market prices for the  leased property unless other information or a reasonable belief based on  its experience provides the better information. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. An automobile lessor offering a three-year open-end lease assigns  a wholesale value to the vehicle at the end of the lease term. The  lessor may disclose as an estimate a wholesale value derived from a  generally accepted trade publication listing current wholesale values.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above, except that the lessor discloses an  estimated value derived by adjusting the residual value quoted in the  trade publication because, in its experience, the trade publication  values either understate or overstate the prices actually received in  local used vehicle markets. The lessor may adjust estimated values  quoted in trade publications if the lessor reasonably believes based on  its experience that the values are understated or overstated.</p><p class="depth0">4. Retail or wholesale value. The lessor may choose either a retail  or a wholesale value in estimating the value of leased property at  termination of an open-end lease provided the choice is consistent with  the lessor's general practice when determining the value of the property  at the end of the lease term. The lessor should indicate whether the  value disclosed is a retail or wholesale value.</p><p class="depth0">5. Labeling estimates. Generally, only the disclosure for which the  exact information is unknown is labeled as an estimate. Nevertheless,  when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown  information, the lessor has the option of labeling as an estimate every  affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected.</p><p class="depth0">3(e) Effect of Subsequent Occurrence</p><p class="depth0">1. Subsequent occurrences. Examples of subsequent occurrences  include:</p><p class="depth0">i. An agreement between the lessee and lessor to change from a  monthly to a weekly payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An increase in official fees or taxes.</p><p class="depth0">iii. An increase in insurance premiums or coverage caused by a  change in the law.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Late delivery of an automobile caused by a strike.</p><p class="depth0">2. Redisclosure. When a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of a  subsequent occurrence, the lessor need not make new disclosures unless  new disclosures are required under Sec. 1013.5.</p><p class="depth0">3. Lessee's failure to perform. The lessor does not violate the  regulation if a previously given disclosure becomes inaccurate when a  lessee fails to perform obligations under the contract and a lessor  takes actions that are necessary and proper in such circumstances to  protect its interest. For example, the addition of insurance or a  security interest by the lessor because the lessee has not performed  obligations contracted for in the lease is not a violation of the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.4--Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">4(a) Description of Property</p><p class="depth0">1. Placement of description. Although the description of leased  property may not be included among the segregated disclosures, a lessor  may choose to place the description directly above the segregated  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4(b) Amount Due at Lease Signing or Delivery</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation. See commentary to Sec. 1013.3(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Capitalized cost reduction. A capitalized cost reduction is a  payment in the nature of a downpayment on the leased property that  reduces the amount to be capitalized over the term of the lease. This  amount does not include any amounts included in a periodic payment paid  at lease signing or delivery.</p><p class="depth0">3. ``Negative'' equity trade-in allowance. If an amount owed on a  prior lease or credit balance exceeds the agreed upon value of a trade- in, the difference is not reflected as a negative trade-in allowance  under Sec. 1013.4(b). The lessor may disclose the trade-in allowance as  zero or not applicable, or may leave a blank line.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebates. Only rebates applied toward an amount due at lease  signing or delivery are required to be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(b).</p><p class="depth0">5. Balance sheet approach. In motor vehicle leases, the total for  the column labeled ``total amount due at lease signing or delivery''  must equal the total for the column labeled ``how the amount due at  lease signing or delivery will be paid.''</p><p class="depth0">6. Amounts to be paid in cash. The term cash is intended to include  payments by check or other payment methods in addition to currency;  however, a lessor may add a line item under the column ``how the amount  due at lease signing or delivery will be paid'' for non-currency  payments such as credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">4(c) Payment Schedule and Total Amount of Periodic Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic payments. The phrase ``number, amount, and due dates or  periods of payments'' requires the disclosure of all payments that are  made at regular or irregular intervals and generally derived from rent,  capitalized or amortized amounts such as depreciation, and other amounts  that are collected by the lessor at the same interval(s), including, for  example, taxes, maintenance, and insurance charges. Other periodic  payments may, but need not, be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(c).</p><p class="depth0">4(d) Other Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 1013.4(d) requires the disclosure of charges  that are anticipated by the parties incident to the normal operation of  the lease agreement. If a lessor is unsure whether a particular fee is  an ``other charge,'' the lessor may disclose the fee as such without  violating Sec. 1013.4(d) or the segregation rule under  Sec. 1013.3(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Excluded charges. This section does not require disclosure of  charges that are imposed when the lessee terminates early, fails to  abide by, or modifies the terms of the existing lease agreement, such as  charges for:</p><p class="depth0">i. Late payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Default.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Early termination.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Deferral of payments.</p><p class="depth0">v. Extension of the lease.</p><p class="depth0">3. Third-party fees and charges. Third-party fees or charges  collected by the lessor on behalf of third parties, such as taxes, are  not disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(d).</p><p class="depth0">4. Relationship to other provisions. The other charges mentioned in  this paragraph are charges that are not required to be disclosed under  some other provision of Sec. 1013.4. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. The price of a mechanical breakdown protection (MBP) contract is  sometimes disclosed as an ``other charge.'' Nevertheless, the price of  MBP is sometimes reflected in the periodic payment disclosure under  Sec. 1013.4(c) or in states where MBP is regarded as insurance, the cost  is be disclosed in accordance with Sec. 1013.4(o).</p><p class="depth0">5. Lessee's liabilities at the end of the lease term. Liabilities  that the lessor imposes upon the lessee at the end of the scheduled  lease term and that must be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(d) include  disposition and ``pick-up'' charges.</p><p class="depth0">6. Optional ``disposition'' charges. Disposition and similar charges  that are anticipated by the parties as an incident to the normal  operation of the lease agreement must be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(d).  If, under a lease agreement, a lessee may return leased property to  various locations, and the lessor charges a disposition fee depending  upon the location chosen, under Sec. 1013.4(d), the lessor must disclose  the highest amount charged. In such circumstances, the lessor may also  include a brief explanation of the fee structure in the segregated  disclosure. For example, if no fee or a lower fee is imposed for  returning a leased vehicle to the originating dealer as opposed to  another location, that fact may be disclosed. By contrast, if the terms  of the lease treat the return of the leased property to a location  outside the lessor's service area as a default, the fee imposed is not  disclosed as an ``other charge,'' although it may be required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(q).</p><p class="depth0">4(e) Total of Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Open-end lease. The additional statement is required under  Sec. 1013.4(e) for open-end leases because, with some limitations, a  lessee is liable at the end of the lease term for the difference between  the residual and realized values of the leased property.</p><p class="depth0">4(f) Payment Calculation</p><p class="depth0">1. Motor vehicle lease. Whether leased property is a motor vehicle  is determined by state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple items. If a lease transaction involves multiple items of  leased property, one of which is not a motor vehicle under state law, at  their option, lessors may include all   items in the disclosures required under Sec. 1013.4(f). See comment  3(a)-4 regarding disclosure of multiple transactions.</p><p class="depth0">4(f)(1) Gross Capitalized Cost</p><p class="depth0">1. Agreed upon value of the vehicle. The agreed upon value of a  motor vehicle includes the amount of capitalized items such as charges  for vehicle accessories and options, and delivery or destination  charges. The lessor may also include taxes and fees for title, licenses,  and registration that are capitalized. Charges for service or  maintenance contracts, insurance products, guaranteed automobile  protection, or an outstanding balance on a prior lease or credit  transaction are not included in the agreed upon value.</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization of the gross capitalized cost. The lessor may choose  to provide the itemization of the gross capitalized cost only on request  or may provide the itemization as a matter of course. In the latter  case, the lessor need not provide a statement of the lessee's option to  receive an itemization. The gross capitalized cost must be itemized by  type and amount. The lessor may include in the itemization an  identification of the items and amounts of some or all of the items  contained in the agreed upon value of the vehicle. The itemization must  be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by  Sec. 1013.4, but it may not be included among the segregated  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4(f)(7) Total of Base Periodic Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Accuracy of disclosure. If the periodic payment calculation under  Sec. 1013.4(f) has been calculated correctly, the amount disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(f)(7)--the total of base periodic payments--is correct for  disclosure purposes even if that amount differs from the base periodic  payment disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(f)(9) multiplied by the number of  lease payments disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(f)(8), when the difference is  due to rounding.</p><p class="depth0">4(f)(8) Lease Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Lease Term. The lease term may be disclosed among the segregated  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4(g) Early Termination</p><p class="depth0">4(g)(1) Conditions and Disclosure of Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonableness of charges. See the commentary to Sec. 1013.4(q).</p><p class="depth0">2. Description of the method. Section 1013.4(g)(1) requires a full  description of the method of determining an early termination charge.  The lessor should attempt to provide consumers with clear and  understandable descriptions of its early termination charges.  Descriptions that are full, accurate, and not intended to be misleading  will comply with Sec. 1013.4(g)(1), even if the descriptions are  complex. In providing a full description of an early termination method,  a lessor may use the name of a generally accepted method of computing  the unamortized cost portion (also known as the ``adjusted lease  balance'') of its early termination charges. For example, a lessor may  state that the ``constant yield'' method will be utilized in obtaining  the adjusted lease balance, but must specify how that figure, and any  other term or figure, is used in computing the total early termination  charge imposed upon the consumer. Additionally, if a lessor refers to a  named method in this manner, the lessor must provide a written  explanation of that method if requested by the consumer. The lessor has  the option of providing the explanation as a matter of course in the  lease documents or on a separate document.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing of written explanation of a named method. While a lessor  may provide an address or telephone number for the consumer to request a  written explanation of the named method used to calculate the adjusted  leased balance, if at consummation a consumer requests such an  explanation, the lessor must provide a written explanation at that time.  If a consumer requests an explanation after consummation, the lessor  must provide a written explanation within a reasonable time after the  request is made.</p><p class="depth0">4. Default. When default is a condition for early termination of a  lease, default charges must be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(g)(1). See  the commentary to Sec. 1013.4(q).</p><p class="depth0">5. Lessee's liability at early termination. When the lessee is  liable for the difference between the unamortized cost and the realized  value at early termination, the method of determining the amount of the  difference must be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0">4(h) Maintenance Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">1. Standards for wear and use. No disclosure is required if a lessor  does not set standards or impose charges for wear and use (such as  excess mileage).</p><p class="depth0">4(i) Purchase Option</p><p class="depth0">1. Mandatory disclosure of no purchase option. Generally the lessor  need only make the specific required disclosures that apply to a  transaction. In the case of a purchase option disclosure, however, a  lessor must disclose affirmatively that the lessee has no option to  purchase the leased property if the purchase option is inapplicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Existence of purchase option. Whether a purchase option exists  under the lease is determined by state or other applicable law. The  lessee's right to submit a bid to purchase property at termination of  the lease is not an option to purchase under Sec. 1013.4(i) if the  lessor is not required to accept the lessee's bid and the lessee does  not receive preferential treatment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Purchase-option fee. A purchase-option fee is disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(i), not Sec. 1013.4(d). The fee may be separately itemized  or disclosed as part of the purchase-option price.</p><p class="depth0">4. Official fees and taxes. Official fees such as those for taxes,  licenses, and registration charged in connection with the exercise of a  purchase option may be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(i) as part of the  purchase-option price (with or without a reference to their inclusion in  that price) or may be separately disclosed and itemized by category.  Alternatively, a lessor may provide a statement indicating that the  purchase-option price does not include fees for tags, taxes, and  registration.</p><p class="depth0">5. Purchase-option price. Lessors must disclose the purchase-option  price as a sum certain or as a sum certain to be determined at a future  date by reference to a readily available independent source. The  reference should provide sufficient information so that the lessee will  be able to determine the actual price when the option becomes available.  Statements of a purchase price as the ``negotiated price'' or the ``fair  market value'' do not comply with the requirements of Sec. 1013.4(i).</p><p class="depth0">4(j) Statement Referencing Nonsegregated Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. A lessor may delete inapplicable items from the  disclosure. For example, if a lease contract does not include a security  interest, the reference to a security interest may be omitted.</p><p class="depth0">4(l) Right of Appraisal</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure inapplicable. The lessee does not have the right to an  independent appraisal merely because the lessee is liable at the end of  the lease term or at early termination for unreasonable wear or use.  Thus, the disclosure under Sec. 1013.4(l) does not apply. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The automobile lessor might expect a lessee to return an undented  car with four good tires at the end of the lease term. Even though it  may hold the lessee liable for the difference between a dented car with  bald tires and the value of a car in reasonably good repair, the  disclosure under Sec. 1013.4(l) is not required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lessor's appraisal. If the lessor obtains an appraisal of the  leased property to determine its realized value, that appraisal does not  suffice for purposes of section 183(c) of the Act; the lessor must  disclose the lessee's right to an independent appraisal under  Sec. 1013.4(l).</p><p class="depth0">3. Retail or wholesale. In providing the disclosures in  Sec. 1013.4(l), a lessor must indicate whether the wholesale or retail  appraisal value will be used.</p><p class="depth0">4. Time restriction on appraisal. The regulation does not specify a  time period in which the lessee must exercise the appraisal right. The  lessor may require a lessee to obtain the appraisal within a reasonable  time after termination of the lease.</p><p class="depth0">4(m) Liability at End of Lease Term Based on Residual Value</p><p class="depth0">1. Open-end leases. Section 1013.4(m) applies only to open-end  leases.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lessor's payment of attorney's fees. Section 183(a) of the Act  requires that the lessor pay the lessee's attorney's fees in all actions  under Sec. 1013.4(m), whether successful or not.</p><p class="depth0">4(m)(1) Rent and Other Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This disclosure is intended to represent the cost of  financing an open-end lease based on charges and fees that the lessor  requires the lessee to pay. Examples of disclosable charges, in addition  to the rent charge, include acquisition, disposition, or assignment  fees. Charges imposed by a third party whose services are not required  by the lessor (such as official fees and voluntary insurance) are not  included in the Sec. 1013.4(m)(1) disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">4(m)(2) Excess Liability</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The disclosure limiting the lessee's liability for the  value of the leased property does not apply in the case of early  termination.</p><p class="depth0">2. Leases with a minimum term. If a lease has an alternative minimum  term, the disclosures governing the liability limitation are not  applicable for the minimum term.</p><p class="depth0">3. Charges not subject to rebuttable presumption. The limitation on  liability applies only to liability at the end of the lease term that is  based on the difference between the residual value of the leased  property and its realized value. The regulation does not preclude a  lessor from recovering other charges from the lessee at the end of the  lease term. Examples of such charges include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Disposition charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Excess mileage charges.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Late payment and default charges.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In simple-interest accounting leases, amount by which the  unamortized cost exceeds the residual value because the lessee has not  made timely payments.</p><p class="depth0">4(n) Fees and Taxes</p><p class="depth0">1. Treatment of certain taxes. Taxes paid in connection with the  lease are generally disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(n), but there are  exceptions. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. Taxes paid by lease signing or delivery are disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(b) and Sec. 1013.4(n).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Taxes that are part of the scheduled payments are reflected in  the disclosure under Sec. 1013.4(c), (f), and (n).</p><p class="depth0">iii. A tax payable by the lessor that is passed on to the consumer  and is reflected in the lease documentation must be disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(n). A tax payable by the lessor and absorbed as a cost of  doing business need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Taxes charged in connection with the exercise of a purchase  option are disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(i), not Sec. 1013.4(n).</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimates. In disclosing the total amount of fees and taxes under  Sec. 1013.4(n), lessors may need to base the disclosure on estimated tax  rates or amounts and are afforded great flexibility in doing so. Where a  rate is applied to the future value of leased property, lessors have  flexibility in estimating that value, including, but not limited to,  using the mathematical average of the agreed upon value and the residual  value or published valuation guides; or a lessor could prepare estimates  using the agreed upon value and disclose a reasonable estimate of the  total fees and taxes. Lessors may include a statement that the actual  total of fees and taxes may be higher or lower depending on the tax  rates in effect or the value of the leased property at the time a fee or  tax is assessed.</p><p class="depth0">4(o) Insurance</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. If insurance is obtained through the lessor,  information on the type and amount of insurance coverage (whether  voluntary or required) as well as the cost, must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lessor's insurance. Insurance purchased by the lessor primarily  for its own benefit, and absorbed as a business expense and not  separately charged to the lessee, need not be disclosed under  Sec. 1013.4(o) even if it provides an incidental benefit to the lessee.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mechanical breakdown protection and other products. Whether  products purchased in conjunction with a lease, such as mechanical  breakdown protection (MBP) or guaranteed automobile protection (GAP),  should be treated as insurance is determined by state or other  applicable law. In states that do not treat MBP or GAP as insurance,  Sec. 1013.4(o) disclosures are not required. In such cases the lessor  may, however, disclose this information in accordance with the  additional information provision in Sec. 1013.3(b). For MBP insurance  contracts not capped by a dollar amount, lessors may describe coverage  by referring to a limitation by mileage or time period, for example, by  indicating that the mechanical breakdown contract insures parts of the  automobile for up to 100,000 miles.</p><p class="depth0">4(p) Warranties or Guarantees</p><p class="depth0">1. Brief identification. The statement identifying warranties may be  brief and need not describe or list all warranties applicable to  specific parts such as for air conditioning, radio, or tires in an  automobile. For example, manufacturer's warranties may be identified  simply by a reference to the standard manufacturer's warranty. If a  lessor provides a comprehensive list of warranties that may not all  apply, to comply with Sec. 1013.4(p) the lessor must indicate which  warranties apply or, alternatively, which warranties do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">2. Warranty disclaimers. Although a disclaimer of warranties is not  required by the regulation, the lessor may give a disclaimer as  additional information in accordance with Sec. 1013.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">3. State law. Whether an express warranty or guaranty exists is  determined by state or other law.</p><p class="depth0">4(q) Penalties and Other Charges for Delinquency</p><p class="depth0">1. Collection costs. The automatic imposition of collection costs or  attorney fees upon default must be disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(q).  Collection costs or attorney fees that are not imposed automatically,  but are contingent upon expenditures in conjunction with a collection  proceeding or upon the employment of an attorney to effect collection,  need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges for early termination. When default is a condition for  early termination of a lease, default charges must also be disclosed  under Sec. 1013.4(g)(1). The Sec. 1013.4(q) and (g)(1) disclosures may,  but need not, be combined. Examples of combined disclosures are provided  in the model lease disclosure forms in appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">3. Simple-interest leases. In a simple-interest accounting lease,  the additional rent charge that accrues on the lease balance when a  periodic payment is made after the due date does not constitute a  penalty or other charge for late payment. Similarly, continued accrual  of the rent charge after termination of the lease because the lessee  fails to return the leased property does not constitute a default  charge. But in either case, if the additional charge accrues at a rate  higher than the normal rent charge, the lessor must disclose the amount  of or the method of determining the additional charge under  Sec. 1013.4(q).</p><p class="depth0">4. Extension charges. Extension charges that exceed the rent charge  in a simple-interest accounting lease or that are added separately are  disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(q).</p><p class="depth0">5. Reasonableness of charges. Pursuant to section 183(b) of the Act,  penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early  termination may be specified in the lease but only in an amount that is  reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the  delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of  loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an  adequate remedy.</p><p class="depth0">4(r) Security Interest</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosable security interests. See Sec. 1013.2(o) and  accompanying commentary to determine what security interests must be  disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">4(s) Limitations on Rate Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Segregated disclosures. A lease rate may not be included among  the segregated disclosures referenced in Sec. 1013.3(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.5--Renegotiations, Extensions, and Assumptions</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 1013.5 applies only to existing leases that are  covered by the regulation. It does not apply to the renegotiation or  extension of leases with an initial term of four months or less, because  such leases are not covered by the definition of consumer lease in  Sec. 1013.2(e). Whether and when a lease is satisfied and replaced by a  new lease is determined by state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">5(a) Renegotiation</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis of disclosures. Lessors have flexibility in making  disclosures so long as they reflect the legal obligation under the  renegotiated lease. For example, assume that a 24-month lease is  replaced by a 36-month lease. The initial lease began on January 1,  1998, and was renegotiated and replaced on July 1, 1998, so that the new  lease term ends on January 1, 2001.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the renegotiated lease covers the 36-month period beginning  January 1, 1998, the new disclosures would reflect all payments made by  the lessee on the initial lease and all payments on the renegotiated  lease. In this example, since the renegotiated lease covers a 36-month  period beginning January 1, 1998, the disclosures must reflect payments  made since that date. On the model form, the ``total of base periodic  payments'' disclosed under Sec. 1013.4(f)(7) should reflect periodic  payments to be made over the entire 36-month term. Payments received  since January 1, 1998, are added as a new line item disclosed as ``total  of payments received'' and are subtracted from the ``total of base  periodic payments'' in calculating a new item disclosed as the ``total  of base periodic payments remaining.'' For example, if 6 monthly  payments of $300 were received since January 1, 1998, the disclosure  form should include a ``total of base periodic payments'' line from  which $1,800 is subtracted to arrive at the ``total of base periodic  payments remaining.'' The remainder of the disclosures would not change.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the renegotiated lease covers only the remaining 30 months,  from July 1, 1998, to January 1, 2001, the disclosures would reflect  only the charges incurred in connection with the renegotiation and the  payments for the remaining period.</p><p class="depth0">5(b) Extension</p><p class="depth0">1. Time of extension disclosures. If a consumer lease is extended  for a specified term greater than six months, new disclosures are  required at the time the extension is agreed upon. If the lease is  extended on a month-to-month basis and the cumulative extensions exceed  six months, new disclosures are required at the commencement of the  seventh month and at the commencement of each seventh month thereafter  for as long as the extensions continue. If a consumer lease is extended  for terms of varying durations, one of which will exceed six months  beyond the originally scheduled termination date of the lease, new  disclosures are required at the commencement of the term that will  exceed six months beyond the originally scheduled termination date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of disclosures for month-to-month extensions. The  disclosures for a lease extended on a month-to-month basis for more than  six months should reflect the month-to-month nature of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures should be based on the  extension period, including any upfront costs paid in connection with  the extension. For example, assume that initially a lease ends on March  1, 1999. In January 1999, agreement is reached to extend the lease until  October 1, 1999. The disclosure would include any extension fee paid in  January and the periodic payments for the seven-month extension period  beginning in March.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.6 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.7--Advertising</p><p class="depth0">7(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Persons covered. All ``persons'' must comply with the advertising  provisions in this section, not just those that meet the definition of a  lessor in Sec. 1013.2(h). Thus, automobile dealers (to the extent they  are not excluded from the Bureau's rulemaking authority by section 1029  of the Dodd-Frank Act), merchants, and others who are not themselves  lessors must comply with the advertising provisions of the regulation if  they advertise consumer lease transactions. Pursuant to section 184(b)  of the Act, however, owners and personnel of the media in which an  advertisement appears or through which it is disseminated are not  subject to civil liability for violations under section 185(b) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth0">2. ``Usually and customarily.'' Section 1013.7(a) does not prohibit  the advertising of a single item or the promotion of a new leasing  program, but prohibits the advertising of terms that are not and will  not be available. Thus, an advertisement may state terms that will be  offered for only a limited period or terms that will become available at  a future date.</p><p class="depth0">3. Total contractual obligation of advertised lease. Section 1013.7  applies to advertisements for consumer leases, as defined in  Sec. 1013.2(e). Under Sec. 1013.2(e), a consumer lease is exempt from  the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation  exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. See  comment 2(e)-9. Accordingly, Sec. 1013.7 does not apply to an  advertisement for a specific consumer lease if the total contractual  obligation for that lease exceeds the threshold amount in effect when  the advertisement is made. If a lessor promotes multiple consumer leases  in a single advertisement, the entire advertisement must comply with  Sec. 1013.7 unless all of the advertised leases are exempt under  Sec. 1013.2(e). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states that certain  terms apply to a consumer lease for a specific automobile. The total  contractual obligation of the advertised lease exceeds the threshold  amount in effect when the advertisement is made. Although the  advertisement does not refer to any other lease, some or all of the  advertised terms for the exempt lease also apply to other leases offered  by the lessor with total contractual obligations that do not exceed the  applicable threshold amount. The advertisement is not required to comply  with Sec. 1013.7 because it refers only to an exempt lease.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states certain terms  (such as the amount due at lease signing) that will apply to consumer  leases for automobiles of a particular brand. However, the advertisement  does not refer to a specific lease. The total contractual obligations of  the leases for some of the automobiles will exceed the threshold amount  in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual  obligations of the leases for other automobiles will not exceed the  threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with Sec. 1013.7 because  it refers to terms for consumer leases that are not exempt.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that, in a single advertisement, a lessor states that  certain terms apply to consumer leases for two different automobiles.  The total contractual obligation of the lease for the first automobile  exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made,  but the total contractual obligation of the lease for the second  automobile does not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must  comply with Sec. 1013.7 because it refers to a consumer lease that is  not exempt.</p><p class="depth0">7(b) Clear and Conspicuous Standard</p><p class="depth0">1. Standard. The disclosures in an advertisement in any media must  be reasonably understandable. For example, very fine print in a  television advertisement or detailed and very rapidly stated information  in a radio advertisement does not meet the clear and conspicuous  standard if consumers cannot see and read or hear, and cannot  comprehend, the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(1) Amount Due at Lease Signing or Delivery</p><p class="depth0">1. Itemization not required. Only a total of amounts due at lease  signing or delivery is required to be disclosed, not an itemization of  its component parts. Such an itemization is provided in any transaction- specific disclosures provided under Sec. 1013.4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prominence rule. Except for a periodic payment, oral or written  references to components of the total due at lease signing or delivery  (for example, a reference to a capitalized cost reduction, where  permitted) may not be more prominent than the disclosure of the total  amount due at lease signing or delivery.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(2) Advertisement of a Lease Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Location of statement. The notice required to accompany a  percentage rate stated in an advertisement must be placed in close  proximity to the rate without any other intervening language or symbols.  For example, a lessor may not place an asterisk next to the rate and  place the notice elsewhere in the advertisement. In addition, with the  exception of the notice required by Sec. 1013.4(s), the rate cannot be  more prominent than any other Sec. 1013.4 disclosure stated in the  advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">7(c) Catalogs or Other Multi-Page Advertisements; Electronic</p><p class="depth0">Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. The multiple-page advertisements referred to in  Sec. 1013.7(c) are advertisements consisting of a series of numbered  pages--for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing comprising  several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single  envelope is not a single multiple-page advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Cross references. A catalog or other multiple-page advertisement  or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an  internet Web site) is a single advertisement (requiring only one set of  lease disclosures) if it contains a table, chart, or schedule with the  disclosures required under Sec. 1013.7(d)(2)(i) through (v). If one of  the triggering terms listed in Sec. 1013.7(d)(1) appears in a catalog,  or in a multiple-page or electronic advertisement, it must clearly  direct the consumer to the page or location where the table, chart, or  schedule begins. For example, in an electronic advertisement, a term  triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that  directly connects the consumer to the additional information.</p><p class="depth0">7(d)(1) Triggering Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Typical example. When any triggering term appears in a lease  advertisement, the additional terms enumerated in Sec. 1013.7(d)(2)(i)  through (v) must also appear. In a multi-lease advertisement, an example  of one or more typical leases with a statement of all the terms  applicable to each may be used. The examples must be labeled as such and  must reflect representative lease terms that are made available by the  lessor to consumers.</p><p class="depth0">7(d)(2) Additional Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Third-party fees that vary by state or locality. The disclosure  of a periodic payment or total amount due at lease signing or delivery  may:</p><p class="depth0">i. Exclude third-party fees, such as taxes, licenses, and  registration fees and disclose that fact; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. Provide a periodic payment or total that includes third-party  fees based on a particular state or locality as long as that fact and  the fact that fees may vary by state or locality are disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">7(e) Alternative Disclosures--Merchandise Tags</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple-item leases. Multiple-item leases that utilize  merchandise tags requiring additional disclosures may use the alternate  disclosure rule.</p><p class="depth0">7(f) Alternative Disclosures--Television or Radio Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">7(f)(1) Toll-Free Number or Print Advertisement</p><p class="depth0">1. Publication in general circulation. A reference to a written  advertisement appearing in a newspaper circulated nationally, for  example, USA Today or the Wall Street Journal, may satisfy the general  circulation requirement in Sec. 1013.7(f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Toll-free number, local or collect calls. In complying with the  disclosure requirements of Sec. 1013.7(f)(1)(i), a lessor must provide a  toll-free number for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than  the one used in the lessor's dialing area. Alternatively, a lessor may  provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone  charges when calling for information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multi-purpose number. When an advertised toll-free number  responds with a recording, lease disclosures must be provided early in  the sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required  disclosures. For example, in providing several dialing options--such as  providing directions to the lessor's place of business--the option  allowing the consumer to request lease disclosures should be provided  early in the telephone message to ensure that the option to request  disclosures is not obscured by other information.</p><p class="depth0">4. Statement accompanying toll free number. Language must accompany  a telephone and television number indicating that disclosures are  available by calling the toll-free number, such as ``call 1-(800) 000- 0000 for details about costs and terms.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.8--Record Retention</p><p class="depth0">1. Manner of retaining evidence. A lessor must retain evidence of  having performed required actions and of having made required  disclosures. Such records may be retained in paper form, on microfilm,  microfiche, or computer, or by any other method designed to reproduce  records accurately. The lessor need retain only enough information to  reconstruct the required disclosures or other records.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1013.9--Relation to State Laws</p><p class="depth0">1. Exemptions granted. The Bureau recognizes exemptions granted by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21,  2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary  determination. Effective October 1, 1982, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System granted the following exemptions from portions of  the Consumer Leasing Act:</p><p class="depth0">i. Maine. Lease transactions subject to the Maine Consumer Credit  Code and its implementing regulations are exempt from Chapters 2, 4, and  5 of the Federal act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in  which a federally chartered institution is a lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Oklahoma. Lease transactions subject to the Oklahoma Consumer  Credit Code are exempt from Chapters 2 and 5 of the Federal act. (The  exemption does not apply to sections 132 through 135 of the Federal act,  nor does it apply to transactions in which a federally chartered  institution is a lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A--Model Forms</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible changes. Although use of the model forms is not  required, lessors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance  with the regulation. Generally, lessors may make certain changes in the  format or content of the forms and may delete any disclosures that are  inapplicable to a transaction without losing the Act's protection from  liability. For example, the model form based on monthly periodic  payments may be modified for single-payment lease transactions or for  quarterly or other regular or irregular periodic payments. The model  form may also be modified to reflect that a transaction is an extension.  The content, format, and headings for the segregated disclosures must be  substantially similar to those contained in the model forms; therefore,  any changes should be minimal. The changes to the model forms should not  be so   extensive as to affect the substance and the clarity of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of acceptable changes.</p><p class="depth0">i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in  referring to the lessee.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Using ``lessee,'' ``lessor,'' or names instead of pronouns.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Rearranging the sequence of the nonsegregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Incorporating certain state ``plain English'' requirements.</p><p class="depth0">v. Deleting or blocking out inapplicable disclosures, filling in  ``N/A'' (not applicable) or ``0,'' crossing out, leaving blanks,  checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items (this  should facilitate use of multipurpose standard forms).</p><p class="depth0">vi. Adding language or symbols to indicate estimates.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Adding numeric or alphabetic designations.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Rearranging the disclosures into vertical columns, except for  Sec. 1013.4(b) through (e) disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Using icons and other graphics.</p><p class="depth0">3. Model closed-end or net vehicle lease disclosure. Model A-2 is  designed for a closed-end or net vehicle lease. Under the ``Early  Termination and Default'' provision a reference to the lessee's right to  an independent appraisal of the leased vehicle under Sec. 1013.4(l) is  included for those closed-end leases in which the lessee's liability at  early termination is based on the vehicle's realized value.</p><p class="depth0">4. Model furniture lease disclosures. Model A-3 is a closed-end  lease disclosure statement designed for a typical furniture lease. It  does not include a disclosure of the appraisal right at early  termination required under Sec. 1013.4(l) because few closed-end  furniture leases base the lessee's liability at early termination on the  realized value of the leased property. The disclosure should be added if  it is applicable.
