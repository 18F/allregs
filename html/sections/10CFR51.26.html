However, if the appropriate NRC staff director determines, at the time of such publication or at any time thereafter, that NRC should prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement in connection with the Commission's action on the license application, the NRC shall follow the procedures set out in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever the appropriate NRC staff director determines that a supplement to an environmental impact statement will be prepared by the NRC, a notice of intent will be prepared as provided in Sec. 51.27, and will be published in the Federal Register as provided in Sec. 51.116. The NRC staff need not conduct a scoping process (see Sec. Sec. 51.27, 51.28, and 51.29), provided, however, that if scoping is conducted, then the scoping must be directed at matters to be addressed in the supplement. If scoping is conducted in a proceeding for a combined license referencing an early site permit under part 52, then the scoping must be directed at matters to be addressed in the supplement as described in Sec. 51.92(e).
