                                Sec. 381.129  False or misleading labeling or containers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No poultry product subject to the Act shall have any false or  misleading labeling or any container that is so made, formed, or filled  as to be misleading. However, established trade names and other labeling  and containers which are not false or misleading and which are approved  by the Administrator in the regulations or in specific cases are  permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No statement, word, picture, design, or device which is false or  misleading in any particular or conveys any false impression or gives  any false indication of origin, identity, or quality, shall appear on  any label. For example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Official grade designations such as the letter grades A, B, and  C may be used in labeling individual carcasses of poultry or containers  of poultry products only if such articles have been graded by a licensed  grader of the Federal or Federal-State poultry grading service and found  to qualify for the indicated grade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Terms having geographical significance with reference to a  particular locality may be used only when the product was produced in  that locality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Fresh frozen'', ``quick frozen'', ``frozen fresh'', and terms  of similar import apply only to ready-to-cook poultry processed in  accordance with Sec. 381.66(f)(1). Ready-to-cook poultry handled in any  other manner and dressed poultry may be labeled ``frozen'' only if it is  frozen in accordance with Sec. 381.66(f)(2) under Department  supervision and is in fact in a frozen state. ``Individually quick  frozen (Kind)'' and terms of similar import are applicable only to  poultry products that are frozen as stated on the label and whose  component parts can be easily separated at time of packing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Poultry products labeled with a term quoted in any paragraph of  Sec. 381.170(b) shall comply with the specifications in the applicable  paragraph. However, parts of poultry may be cut in any manner the  processor desires as long as the labeling appropriately reflects the  contents of the container of such poultry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The terms ``All,'' ``Pure,'' ``100%,'' and terms of similar  connotation shall not be used on labels for products to identify  ingredient content, unless the product is prepared solely from a single  ingredient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever  been below 26 [deg]F may not bear a label declaration of ``fresh.'' A  raw poultry product bearing a label declaration of ``fresh'' but whose  internal temperature has ever been below 26 [deg]F is mislabeled. The  temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product within an  official establishment may deviate below the 26 [deg]F standard by 1  degree (i.e., have a temperature of 25 [deg]F) and still be labeled  ``fresh.'' The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product  outside an official establishment may deviate below the 26 [deg]F  standard by 2 degrees (i.e., have a temperature of 24 [deg]F) and still  be labeled ``fresh.'' The average temperature of poultry product lots of  each specific product type must be 26 [deg]F. Product described in this  paragraph is not subject to the freezing procedures required in Sec.  381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been at  or below 0[deg]F must be labeled with the descriptive term ``frozen,''  except when such labeling duplicates or conflicts with the labeling  requirements in Sec. 381.125 of this subchapter. The word  ``previously'' may be placed next to the term ``frozen'' on an optional  basis. The descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the  principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing  the descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently  affixed to the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as  compared with other   words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is  likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under  customary conditions of purchase and use. Product described in this  paragraph is subject to the freezing procedures required in Sec.  381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been  below 26 [deg]F, but is above 0 [deg]F, is not required to bear any  specific descriptive term. Raw poultry product whose internal  temperature has ever been below 26 [deg]F, but is above 0 [deg]F, may  bear labeling with an optional, descriptive term, provided the optional,  descriptive term does not cause the raw poultry product to become  misbranded. If used, an optional, descriptive term must be prominently  displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional  labeling containing the optional, descriptive term is affixed to the  label, it must be prominently affixed on the label. The additional  labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words,  statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be  read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary  conditions of purchase and use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Handling and relabeling of products. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Except as provided  under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, when any inspected and  passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has  been transported from an official establishment, such product may be  transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral  permission is obtained from the Area Supervisor of the area in which  that official establishment is located. The transportation of the  product may be to the official establishment from which it had been  transported or to another official establishment designated by the  person desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be  authorized only for the purpose of the relabeling of the product. The  Area Supervisor shall record the authorization and other information  necessary to identify the product and shall provide a copy of the record  to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper  shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment,  a careful inspection shall be made of the product by the inspector, and  if it is found that the product is not adulterated, it may be received  into the establishment; but if the product is found to be adulterated,  it shall at once be condemned and disposed of in accordance with Sec.  381.95 of this subchapter. Wholesome product will be relabeled in  accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When any inspected and passed product has become misbranded  under this subpart after it has been transported from an official  establishment, the owner may transport the product in commerce to a  retail entity for relabeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or  (ii) of this section, as appropriate, or to other end users, such as  hotels, restaurants or similar institutions; or, relabel the product in  accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as  appropriate if the product is already at a retail entity. A hotel,  restaurant or similar institution is not required to relabel product  misbranded under this subpart; Provided, That the product is prepared in  meals or as entrees only for sale or service directly to individual  consumers at such institutions, and that the mark of inspection is  removed or obliterated. Oral permission shall be obtained from the Area  Officer-in-Charge of the Compliance Program for the area in which the  product is located prior to such transportation or relabeling. The Area  Officer-in-Charge shall record the authorization and other information  necessary to identify the product, and shall furnish a copy of the  authorization record upon request. Before being offered for sale at a  retail entity, such product shall be relabeled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ready-to-cook chicken may bear the claim ``air chilled'' or  ``air chilling'' on its label only if the product was chilled under a  process that meets the definition of air chilling in Sec. 381.66(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in  accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the  day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of  products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or  frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds  should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing  practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year  identification to be misleading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediately adjacent to the calendar date will be a phrase  explaining the meaning of such date in terms of ``packing'' date, ``sell  by'' date, or ``use before'' date, with or without a further qualifying  phrase, e.g., ``For Maximum Freshness'' or ``For Best Quality.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and  calcium lactate are used together in a dry binding matrix in ground or  formed poultry products, as permitted in Sec. 424.21(c) of subchapter  E, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name a  statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate,  lactic acid, and calcium lactate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When transglutaminase enzyme is used to bind pieces of poultry  to form a cut of poultry, or to reform a piece of poultry from a  multiple cuts of poultry, there shall appear on the label, as part of  the product name, a statement that indicates that the product has been  ``formed'' or ``reformed,'' in addition to other preparation steps,  e.g., ``Formed Turkey Thigh Roast'' or ``Reformed and Shaped Chicken  Breast.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A country of origin statement on the label of any poultry  product ``covered commodity'' as defined in 7 CFR part 65, subpart A,  that is to be sold by a ``retailer,'' as defined in 7 CFR 65.240, must  comply with the requirements in 7 CFR 65.300 and 65.400.
