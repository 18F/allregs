                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Merchandise imported under Line Release generally may  be released without further CBP processing. CBP, however, may choose to  inspect any Line Release shipment. Examinations may be either  specifically ordered by the CBP officer or random.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voiding of Line Release transaction. CBP may void a Line Release  transaction for the following reasons: Because of an examination,  because a carrier transporting the Line Release merchandise is not a  participant in a CBP-approved industry partnership program, or because a  driver or conveyance is not authorized in accordance with the LBCIP. If  this occurs, CBP will return the invoice to the carrier, and the entry  filer, in order to enter merchandise, must prepare and submit either a  CF 3461 or 3461 Alternate.
