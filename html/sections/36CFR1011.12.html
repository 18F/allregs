                                Sec. 1011.12  How will the Presidio Trust offset a Federal employee's
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal salary offset. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Salary offset is used to collect  debts owed to the United States by Federal employees. If a Presidio  Trust employee owes a debt, the Presidio Trust may offset the employee's  federal salary to collect the debt in the manner described in this  section. For information on how a Federal agency other than the Presidio  Trust may collect a debt from the salary of a Presidio Trust employee,  see Sec. 1011.21 and 1011.22, subpart C, of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this part requires the Presidio Trust to collect a  debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law  allows otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program.  As described in Sec. 1011.9(a) of this part, the Presidio Trust will  refer debts to the FMS for collection by administrative offset,  including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-centralized salary offset for Treasury debts. The Presidio  Trust may collect delinquent debts through non-centralized salary  offset. In these cases, the Presidio Trust may offset a payment  internally or make a request directly to a paying agency to offset a  salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed by a Federal employee.  At least 30 days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal  agency to offset a salary payment, the Presidio Trust will send notice  to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1011.4 of  this part. When referring a debt for offset, the Presidio Trust will  certify to the paying agency, in writing, that the debt is valid,  delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are  no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, the Presidio  Trust will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to  salary offset have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and  this section for a description of the process for salary offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When prior notice not required. The Presidio Trust is not  required to provide prior notice to a Presidio Trust employee when the  following adjustments are made:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any adjustment to pay arising out of a Presidio Trust employee's  election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits  program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be  recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or fewer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct  an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors  or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred  within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time  of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual  is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the  adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if,  at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the  individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of  the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hearing procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request for a hearing. A Presidio Trust  employee who has received a notice that a debt will be collected by  means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or  amount of the debt. The employee also may request a   hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the  employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for  hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in  Sec. 1011.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated  office on or before the 15th business day following the employee's  receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify  whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is  requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved  by review of the documentary evidence alone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to submit timely request for hearing. If the employee  fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described  in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the  right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, the  Presidio Trust may accept a late request for hearing if the employee can  show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the  employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of  the filing deadline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hearing official. The Presidio Trust hearing must be conducted  by a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the  Board of Directors of the Presidio Trust. The hearing official need not  be an employee of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, a  designated hearing official will inform the employee of the form of the  hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice will set forth the  date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice  will notify the employee of the date by which the employee should submit  written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing  official will give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation  in support of the employee's position. The hearing official will  schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing  official will give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place  of a rescheduled hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Oral hearing. The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing  if the official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review  of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility  or veracity is involved). The hearing official will determine the  procedure for the oral hearing, determining, for example, the hearing  length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines that an oral  hearing is not necessary, the official will make the determination based  upon a review of the available written record, including any  documentation submitted by the employee in support of the employee's  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Date of decision. The hearing official will issue a written  opinion setting forth the decision, based upon documentary evidence and  information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Final agency action. The hearing official's decision will be  final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Salary offset process. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of disposable pay. The  Presidio Trust payroll office will determine the amount of the  employee's disposable pay (as defined in Sec. 1011.1 of this part) and  will implement salary offset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When salary offset begins. Deductions will begin within three  official pay periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of salary offset. The amount to be offset from each  salary payment will be up to 15% of the employee's disposable pay, as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15% of the  disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump sum  payment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater  than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will  not exceed 15% of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made  unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater  amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final salary payment. After the employee's employment with the  Presidio Trust ends, the Presidio Trust may make a lump sum deduction  exceeding 15% of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments  in order to satisfy a debt.</p>
