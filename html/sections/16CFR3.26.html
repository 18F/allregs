                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section sets forth two procedures by which respondents may obtain consideration of whether continuation of an adjudicative proceeding is in the

public interest after a court has denied preliminary injunctive relief in a separate proceeding brought under section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 53(b), in aid of the adjudicative proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A motion under this section shall be addressed to the Commission and must be filed within 14 days after, but no earlier than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A district court has denied the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction, if the Commission has not filed a motion for relief pending appeal with the court of appeals within 7 days following the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A court of appeals has denied a Commission motion for relief pending appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal from adjudication. Following denial of court relief as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, respondents may move that the adjudicative proceeding be withdrawn from adjudication in order to consider whether the public interest warrants further litigation. Although all respondents must consent to the filing of such a motion, a motion under this paragraph (c) may be filed jointly or separately by each of the respondents in the adjudicative proceeding. At the time respondents file a motion under this paragraph (c), respondents must also electronically transmit a copy to complaint counsel. The Secretary shall issue an order withdrawing the matter from adjudication 2 days after such a motion is filed, except that, if complaint counsel file an objection asserting that the conditions of paragraph (b) of this section have not been met, the Commission shall decide the motion within 10 days after the objection is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consideration on the record of a motion to dismiss. (1) In lieu of a motion to withdraw the adjudicative proceeding from adjudication under paragraph (c) of this section, any respondent may file a motion under this paragraph to dismiss the administrative complaint on the basis that the public interest does not warrant further litigation after a court has denied preliminary injunctive relief to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stay. The filing of a motion under this paragraph (d) shall stay the proceeding until 7 days following the disposition of the motion by the Commission, and all deadlines established by these rules shall be tolled for the amount of time the proceeding is so stayed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Answer. Complaint counsel may file a response within 7 days after such motion is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ruling by Commission. Within 30 days after the deadline for filing a response, the Commission shall rule on any motion under this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Form. Memoranda in support of or in opposition to motions authorized by this section shall not exceed 10,000 words. This word count limitation includes headings, footnotes, and quotations, but does not include the cover, table of contents, table of citations or authorities, glossaries, statements with respect to oral argument, any addendums containing statutes, rules or regulations, any certificates of counsel, proposed form of order, and any attachment required by Sec. 3.45(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> In camera materials. If any filing includes materials that are subject to confidentiality protections pursuant to an order entered in either the proceeding under section 13(b) or the adjudicative proceeding, such materials shall be treated as in camera materials for purposes of this paragraph and the party shall file 2 versions of the document in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 3.45(e). The time within which complaint counsel may file an objection or response under this section will begin to run upon service of the in camera version of the motion (including any supporting briefs and memoranda).
