                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section sets forth two procedures by which respondents may obtain consideration of whether continuation of an adjudicative proceeding is in the public interest after a court has denied preliminary injunctive relief in a separate proceeding brought under section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 53(b), in aid of the adjudication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A motion under this section shall be addressed to the Commission and filed with the Secretary of the Commission. If the Commission has filed a request for a stay, injunction, or other emergency relief pending appeal to a court of appeals, the motion must be filed within 14 days after, but no earlier than, the court of appeals has denied the Commission's request. In cases in which the Commission has not sought relief from the court of appeals within 7 days following the denial of a preliminary injunction, the motion must be filed within 14 days after the district court has denied preliminary relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal from adjudication. If a court has denied preliminary injunctive relief to the Commission in a section 13(b) proceeding brought in aid of an adjudicative proceeding, respondents may move that the proceeding be withdrawn from adjudication in order to consider whether or not the public interest warrants further litigation. Such a motion shall be filed jointly or separately by each of the respondents in the adjudicative proceeding. Complaint counsel may file a response within 14 days after such motion is filed. The matter will not be withdrawn from adjudication unless the Commission so directs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consideration on the record. Instead of a motion to withdraw the matter from adjudication, any respondent or respondents may file a motion under this paragraph to dismiss the administrative complaint on the basis that the public interest does not warrant further litigation after a court has denied preliminary injunctive relief to the Commission. Complaint counsel may file a response within 14 days after such motion is filed. The filing of a motion to dismiss shall not stay the proceeding unless the Commission so directs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Form. Memoranda in support of or in opposition to such motions shall not exceed 10,000 words. This word count limitation includes headings, footnotes, and quotations, but does not include the cover, table of contents, table of citations or authorities, glossaries, statements with respect to oral argument, any addendums containing statutes, rules or regulations, any certificates of counsel, proposed form of order, and any attachment required by Sec. 3.45(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In camera materials. If any filing includes materials that are subject to confidentiality protections pursuant to an order entered in either the proceeding under section 13(b) or in the proceeding under this part, such materials shall be treated as in camera materials for purposes of this paragraph and the party shall file 2 versions of the document in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 3.45(e). The time within which complaint counsel may file an answer under this paragraph will begin to run upon service of the in camera version of the motion (including any supporting briefs and memoranda).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ruling by Commission. The Commission shall rule on any motion authorized by this section within 30 days after the filing of the motion and any memoranda in support of or in opposition to the motion.
