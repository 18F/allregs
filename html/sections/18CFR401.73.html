It may be stated in such detail as the objector may elect. The  request shall be deemed filed only upon receipt by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever the Executive Director determines that the request for  a hearing is insufficient to identify the nature and scope of the  objection, or that one or more issues may be resolved, reduced or  identified by such action, he may require the objector to prepare and  submit to the Commission, within such reasonable time (not less than 30  days) as he may specify, a technical report of the facts relating to the  objection prior to the scheduling of the hearing. The report shall be  required by notice in writing served upon the objector by certified  mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person or entity filing  the request for hearing at the place indicated in the request.</p>
