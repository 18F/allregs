                            <p class="depth0">An inmate desiring to have regular visitors must submit a list of proposed visitors to the designated staff. See Sec. 540.45 for qualification as special visitor. Staff are to compile a visiting list for each inmate after suitable investigation in accordance with Sec. 540.51(b) of this part. The list may include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Members of the immediate family. These persons include mother, father, step-parents, foster parents, brothers and sisters, spouse, and children. These individuals are placed on the visiting list, absent strong circumstances which preclude visiting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other relatives. These persons include grandparents, uncles, aunts, in-laws, and cousins. They may be placed

on the approved list if the inmate wishes to have visits from them regularly and if there exists no reason to exclude them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Friends and associates. The visiting privilege ordinarily will be extended to friends and associates having an established relationship with the inmate prior to confinement, unless such visits could reasonably create a threat to the security and good order of the institution. Exceptions to the prior relationship rule may be made, particularly for inmates without other visitors, when it is shown that the proposed visitor is reliable and poses no threat to the security or good order of the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Persons with prior criminal convictions. The existence of a criminal conviction alone does not preclude visits. Staff shall give consideration to the nature, extent and recentness of convictions, as weighed against the security considerations of the institution. Specific approval of the Warden may be required before such visits take place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Children under sixteen. Children under the age of 16 may not visit unless accompanied by a responsible adult. Children shall be kept under supervision of a responsible adult or a children's program. Exceptions in unusual circumstances may be made by special approval of the Warden.
