                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufactured home manufacturer shall permanently affix a ``Comfort Cooling Certificate'' to an interior surface of the home that is readily visible to the home owner. This certificate may be combined with the heating certificate required in Sec. 3280.510. The manufacturer shall comply with one of the following three alternatives in providing the certificate and additional information concerning the cooling of the manufactured home:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alternative I. If a central air conditioning system is provided by the home manufacturer, the heat gain calculation necessary to properly size the air conditioning equipment shall be in accordance with procedures outlined in

chapter 22 of the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, with an assumed location and orientation. The following shall be supplied in the Comfort Cooling Certificate:

On this basis, the system is designed to maintain an indoor temperature of 75 [deg]F when outdoor temperatures are -- [deg]F dry bulb and -- [deg]F wet bulb.</p><p class="depth3">The temperature to which this home can be cooled will change depending upon the amount of exposure of the windows to the sun's radiant heat. Therefore, the home's heat gains will vary dependent upon its orientation to the sun and any permanent shading provided. Information concerning the calculation of cooling loads at various locations, window exposures and shadings are provided in chapter 22 of the 1989 edition of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative 2. For each home suitable for a central air cooling system, the manufacturer shall provide the following statement: ``This air distribution system of this home is suitable for the installation of a central air conditioning system.''</p><p class="depth3">Example Alternate 2</p><p class="depth3">COMFORT COOLING CERTIFICATE

If the manufactured home is not equipped with an air supply duct system, or if the manufacturer elects not to designate the home as being suitable for the installation of a central air conditioning system, the manufacturer shall provide the following statement: ``This air distribution system of this home has not been designed in anticipation of its use with a central air conditioning system.''</p><p class="depth3">Example Alternate 3</p><p class="depth3">COMFORT COOLING CERTIFICATE

If the capacity information provided is based on entrances to the air supply duct at other than the furnace plenum, the manufacturer shall indicate the correct supply air entrance and return air exit locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Comfort cooling information. For each manufactured home designated, either ``suitable for'' or ``provided with'' a central air conditioning system, the manufacturer shall provide comfort cooling information specific to the manufactured home necessary to

complete the cooling load calculations. The comfort cooling information shall include a statement to read as follows:</p><p class="depth2">To determine the required capacity of equipment to cool a home efficiently and economically, a cooling load (heat gain) calculation is required. The cooling load is dependent on the orientation, location and the structure of the home. Central air conditioners operate most efficiently and provide the greatest comfort when their capacity closely approximates the calculated cooling load. Each home's air conditioner should be sized in accordance with chapter 22 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Handbook of Fundamentals, 1989 Edition, once the location and orientation are known.
