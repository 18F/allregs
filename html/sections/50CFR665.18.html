Adjustments in management  measures may be made through rulemaking if new information demonstrates  that there are biological, social, or economic concerns in the fishery.  The following framework process authorizes the implementation of  measures that may affect the operation of the fisheries, gear, harvest  guidelines, or changes in catch and/or effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual report. By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed  pelagics monitoring team will prepare an annual report on the fisheries  in the management area. The report shall contain, among other things,  recommendations for Council action and an assessment of the urgency and  effects of such action(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedure for established measures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Established measures are  regulations for which the impacts have been evaluated in Council or NMFS  documents in the context of current conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Council may recommend to the Regional Administrator that  established measures be modified, removed, or reinstituted. Such  recommendation shall include supporting rationale and analysis, and  shall be made after advance public notice, public discussion, and  consideration of public comment.

After a Council meeting at which the measure is discussed, the  Council will consider recommendations and prepare a Federal Register  notice summarizing the Council's deliberations, rationale, and analysis  for the preferred action, and the time and place for any subsequent  Council meeting(s) to consider the new measure. At subsequent public  meeting(s), the Council will consider public comments and other  information received to make a recommendation to the Regional  Administrator about any new measure. NMFS may implement the Council's  recommendation by rulemaking if approved by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crustacean measures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Introduction.
