(1) State and local governments, public agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10 percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State and local governments, public agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10 percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest by ZIP code. Upon request, before those properties without insured mortgages are publicly listed, HUD will assure that governmental entities and nonprofit organizations are notified in writing when eligible properties become available in the areas designated by them. HUD will coordinate the dissemination of the information to ensure that if more than one purchaser designates a specific area, those purchasers receive the list of properties at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the purchasers. A property in this section will be sold to the first eligible purchaser submitting an acceptable contract. All bids received on the same business day will be considered to have been received simultaneously. In the case of identical bids submitted on the same business day, award will be determined by drawing lots.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest by ZIP code.

HUD will provide a consideration and inspection period for these purchasers. The consideration and inspection period will usually be for ten days from the date of notification of interest, but may be lengthened or shortened by HUD, as appropriate. Those properties in which purchasers express an interest will be held off the market for the duration of the consideration and inspection period. Other properties on the list will continue to

be processed for public sale. HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for a purchaser at any one time, based upon the purchaser's financial capacity as determined by HUD and upon past performance in HUD programs. At the end of the consideration and inspection period, properties in which no governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed a specific intent to purchase will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. Properties in which a governmental entity or nonprofit organization expressed an intent to purchase, during the consideration and inspection period, will continue to be held off the market pending receipt of the sales contract. If a sales contract is not received within a time period of up to 10 days, as determined by HUD, following expiration of the consideration and inspection period, and no other governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed an interest, then the property will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to ensure that properties purchased at a discount are being utilized for expanding affordable housing opportunities, HUD may require, as appropriate, periodic, limited information regarding the purchase and resale of such properties, and certain restrictions on the resale of such properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Direct sales to displaced persons; razed lots; auctions. HUD may seek to dispose of individual properties to individual buyers through methods such as direct sales to displaced persons, sales of razed lots, or auctions. These sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Direct sales to individuals or entities. HUD may also seek to dispose of properties through direct sales to other individuals or entities that do not meet any of the categories specified in this section, if the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner (or his or her designee) finds in writing that such sales would further the goals of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and would be in the best interests of the Secretary. These sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bulk sales. HUD may seek to dispose of properties through bulk sales. Such sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
