                                Sec. 60.4400  How do I conduct the initial and subsequent performance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in  Sec. 60.8. Subsequent NOX performance tests shall be  conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following  the previous performance test).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are two general methodologies that you may use to conduct  the performance tests. For each test run:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Measure the NOX concentration (in parts per million  (ppm)), using EPA Method 7E or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of this part.  For units complying with the output based standard, concurrently measure  the stack gas flow rate, using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this  part, and measure and record the electrical and thermal output from the  unit. Then, use the following equation to calculate the NOX  emission rate: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.004  Where:  E = NOX emission rate, in lb/MWh 1.194 x 10-7 = conversion constant, in lb/dscf-ppm (NOX)c = average NOX concentration for</p><p class="depth4">the run, in ppm Qstd = stack gas volumetric flow rate, in dscf/hr P = gross electrical and mechanical energy output of the combustion</p><p class="depth4">turbine, in MW (for simple-cycle operation), for combined-</p><p class="depth4">cycle operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical</p><p class="depth4">output from the combustion and steam turbines, or, for</p><p class="depth4">combined heat and power operation, the sum of all electrical</p><p class="depth4">and mechanical</p><p class="depth4">output from the combustion and steam turbines plus all useful</p><p class="depth4">recovered thermal output not used for additional electric or</p><p class="depth4">mechanical generation, in MW, calculated according to Sec.</p><p class="depth4">60.4350(f)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Measure the NOX and diluent gas concentrations,  using either EPA Methods 7E and 3A, or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of  this part. Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel  flowmeter (or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output  of the unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate  the NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and,  if necessary, 2 and 3 in Sec. 60.4350(f) to calculate the  NOX emission rate in lb/MWh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sampling traverse points for NOX and (if applicable)  diluent gas are to be selected following EPA Method 20 or EPA Method 1  (non-particulate procedures), and sampled for equal time intervals. The  sampling must be performed with a traversing single-hole probe, or, if  feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples each of the  points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe designed and  documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be used to sample  simultaneously at the required points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you may test  at fewer points than are specified in EPA Method 1 or EPA Method 20 in  appendix A of this part if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may perform a stratification test for NOX and  diluent pursuant to</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> [Reserved], or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) of  appendix A of part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Once the stratification sampling is completed, you may use the  following alternative sample point selection criteria for the  performance test:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If each of the individual traverse point NOX  concentrations is within 10 percent of the mean  concentration for all traverse points, or the individual traverse point  diluent concentrations differs by no more than 5ppm or 0.5 percent CO2  (or O2) from the mean for all traverse points, then you may  use three points (located either 16.7, 50.0 and 83.3 percent of the way  across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts greater than  2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the  wall). The three points must be located along the measurement line that  exhibited the highest average NOX concentration during the  stratification test; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For turbines with a NOX standard greater than 15 ppm  @ 15% O2, you may sample at a single point, located at least  1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of the  individual traverse point NOX concentrations is within 5 percent of the mean concentration for all traverse  points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations differs  by no more than 3ppm or 0.3  percent CO2 (or O2) from the mean for all traverse  points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For turbines with a NOX standard less than or equal  to 15 ppm @ 15% O2, you may sample at a single point, located  at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of  the individual traverse point NOX concentrations is within  2.5 percent of the mean concentration for all  traverse points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations  differs by no more than 1ppm or 0.15 percent CO2 (or O2) from the  mean for all traverse points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The performance test must be done at any load condition within  plus or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. You may perform  testing at the highest achievable load point, if at least 75 percent of  peak load cannot be achieved in practice. You must conduct three  separate test runs for each performance test. The minimum time per run  is 20 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the stationary combustion turbine combusts both oil and gas  as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required for  each fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a combined cycle and CHP turbine systems with supplemental  heat (duct burner), you must measure the total NOX emissions  after the duct burner rather than directly after the turbine. The duct  burner must be in operation during the performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If water or steam injection is used to control NOX  with no additional post-combustion NOX control and you choose  to monitor the steam or water   to fuel ratio in accordance with Sec. 60.4335, then that monitoring  system must be operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20 or EPA  Method 7E run and must be used to determine the fuel consumption and the  steam or water to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable  Sec. 60.4320 NOX emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320  must be demonstrated at each tested load level. Compliance is achieved  if the three-run arithmetic average NOX emission rate at each  tested level meets the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you elect to install a CEMS, the performance evaluation of  the CEMS may either be conducted separately or (as described in Sec.  60.4405) as part of the initial performance test of the affected unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The ambient temperature must be greater than 0 [deg]F during the  performance test.</p>
