Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials within the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall include written statements that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the requirements of Sec. 512.10 of this part, including any required hearing or review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once Broadcasting Board of Governors decides to request offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund.
