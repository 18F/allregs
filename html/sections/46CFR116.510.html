They must not be located in areas where rolling of the vessel could cause contact between the propeller(s) and survival craft. Bulwarks, handrails, and lifelines must be fitted with openings that are normally closed but that may be opened while survival craft are being boarded, allowing passengers to pass through rather than climb over.
