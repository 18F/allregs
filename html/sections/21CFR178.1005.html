                            <p class="depth0">Hydrogen peroxide solution identified in this section may be safely  used to sterilize polymeric food-contact surfaces identified in  paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity. For the purpose of this section, hydrogen peroxide  solution is an aqueous solution containing not more than 35 percent  hydrogen peroxide (CAS Reg. No. 7722-84-1) by weight, meeting the  specifications prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Optional adjuvant substances. Hydrogen peroxide solution  identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain substances  generally recognized as safe in or on food, substances generally  recognized for their intended use in food packaging, substances used in  accordance with a prior sanction or approval, and substances permitted  by applicable regulations in parts 174 through 179 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specifications. Hydrogen peroxide solution shall meet the  specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 7th ed. (2010), pp. 496-497,  which is incorporated by reference. Hydrogen peroxide solution shall  also meet the specifications for ``Acidity,'' ``Chloride,'' and ``Other  requirements'' for Hydrogen Peroxide Concentrate in the United States  Pharmacopeia 36th Revision (2013), pp. 3848-3849, which is incorporated  by reference. The Director of the Office of the Federal Register  approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C.  552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain copies from the United States  Pharmacopeial Convention, 12601 Twinbrook Pkwy., Rockville, MD 20852  (Internet address http://www.usp.org). Copies may be examined at the  Food and Drug Administration's Main Library, 10903 New Hampshire Ave.,  Bldg. 2, Third Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20993, 301-796-2039, or at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

No use of hydrogen peroxide solution in the  sterilization of food packaging material shall be considered to be in  compliance if more than 0.5 part per million of hydrogen peroxide can be  determined in distilled water packaged under production conditions  (assay to be performed immediately after packaging).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conditions of use. (1) Hydrogen peroxide solution identified in  and complying with the specifications in this section may be used by  itself or in combination with other processes to treat food-contact  surfaces to attain commercial sterility at least equivalent to that  attainable by thermal processing for metal containers as provided for in  part 113 of this chapter. Food-contact surfaces include the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Substances                           Limitations ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers..........
