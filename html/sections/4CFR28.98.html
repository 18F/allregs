                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a charge alleging prohibited discrimination (as defined in Sec. 28.95) shall not be filed with the Board's General Counsel unless the charging party has first filed a complaint of discrimination with GAO in accordance with GAO Order 2713.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A charge relating to GAO's disposition of any individual EEO complaint may be filed with the Board's General Counsel at the following times:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days from the receipt by the charging party of a GAO decision rejecting the complaint in whole or part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever a period of more than 120 days has elapsed since the complaint was filed, and the GAO has not issued a final decision; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 30 days from the receipt by the charging party of a final GAO decision concerning the complaint of discrimination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules for adverse and performance based actions. Where an employee is affected by a removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough of not more than 30 days (whether due to disciplinary, performance-based or other reasons), and the employee wishes to allege that such action was due in whole or part to prohibited discrimination (as defined in Sec. 28.95), the employee may elect to do either (but not both) of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> File a charge directly with the Board's General Counsel within 30 days of the effective date of the personnel

action and raise the issue of discrimination in the course of the proceedings before the Board; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File a complaint of discrimination with the GAO pursuant to GAO Order 2713.2. If the employee elects to file a complaint of discrimination with GAO, he or she may still seek Board review of the matter by filing a charge with the Board's General Counsel at the times authorized in paragraph (b) of this section. Where a complaint of discrimination filed with GAO relates to non-EEO issues that are within the Board's jurisdiction in addition to EEO-related allegations, the subsequent charge filed with the Board's General Counsel under paragraph (b) of this section shall be considered a timely appeal of the non-EEO issues. An employee will be deemed to have elected the EEO complaint process if the employee files a timely written complaint of discrimination with GAO before filing a charge with the Board's General Counsel. Consultation with an EEO counselor, without filing a written complaint of discrimination, does not constitute an election of the EEO complaint process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for RIF based actions. An individual alleging discrimination issues in connection with a RIF-based separation may follow the procedures outlined above in paragraph (c) of this section for adverse and performance based actions, or may choose instead a third option. In accordance with the provisions of Sec. 28.13, such an individual may challenge that action by filing directly with the PAB, thus bypassing both the Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness and the Board's Office of General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> The charging party shall file the charge with the Board's Office of General Counsel in accordance with Sec. 28.11. That Office shall investigate the charge in accordance with Sec. 28.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The charging party shall file the charge with the Board's Office of General Counsel in accordance with Sec. 28.11. That Office shall investigate the charge in accordance with Sec. 28.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A charging party challenging a RIF action by filing directly with the PAB shall follow the procedures prescribed in Sec. 28.13 and Sec. 28.18.
