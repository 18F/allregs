Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to Sec. 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under Sec. 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under Sec. 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable GHG-emitting processes and operations listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting in the years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all GHG-emitting processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to facilities with municipal solid waste landfills or industrial waste landfills, or to underground coal mines.

The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Table A-2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98.
