No tolerance is established for bromide in distilled spirits because there is evidence that inorganic bromides do not pass over in the distillation process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To assure safe use of the additive, the label or labeling of the food additive shall bear, in addition to the other information required by the Act, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the additive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adequate directions for use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To assure safe use of the additive, the label or labeling of the treated malt shall bear, in addition to other information required by the Act, the statement, ``Brewer's Malt--To be used in the production of fermented malt beverages only'', or ``Distiller's Malt--To be used in the production of distilled spirits only'', whichever is the case.</p>
