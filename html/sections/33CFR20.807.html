The ALJ will  deem admitted the authenticity of each exhibit submitted before the  hearing unless a party either files written objection and serves it on  all parties or shows good cause for failure to do both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In class II civil penalty proceedings under 33 U.S.C.  1321(b)(6), each exhibit introduced by an interested person must be  marked, and filed and retained in the record of the proceeding, unless  the ALJ permits the substitution of a copy.
