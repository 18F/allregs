                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you determine the value of your geothermal resources under Sec. 1206.352(b)(1)(i) of this subpart, you may subtract a transmission deduction from the gross proceeds you received for the sale of electricity to determine the plant tailgate value of the electricity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transmission deduction consists of either or both of two components:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transmission line costs as determined under paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wheeling costs if the electricity is transmitted across a third party's transmission line under an arm's-length wheeling agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may deduct the actual costs you (including your affiliate(s)) incur for transmitting electricity under your arm's-length wheeling contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine your transmission line cost, you must follow the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your transmission line costs are your actual costs associated with the construction and operation of a transmission line for the purpose of transmitting electricity attributable and allocable to your power plant utilizing Federal geothermal resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must determine the monthly transmission line cost component of the transmission deduction by multiplying the annual transmission line cost rate (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) by the amount of electricity delivered for the reporting month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must redetermine the transmission line cost rate annually either at the beginning of the same month of the year in which the power plant was placed into service or at a time concurrent with the beginning of your annual corporate accounting period. The period you select must coincide with the same period you chose for the generating deduction under Sec. 1206.354(b)(1). After you choose a deduction period, you may not later elect to use a different deduction period without ONRR approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your actual transmission line costs during the reporting period include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section; and either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A return on the capital investment in the transmission line under paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Allowable capital costs under paragraph (b) of this section are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transmission line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allowable capital costs under paragraph (b) of this section are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transmission line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> You may include a return on capital you invested in the purchase of real estate for transmission facilities if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may include a return on capital you invested in the purchase of real estate for transmission facilities if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such purchase is necessary; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The surface is not part of the Federal lease.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rate of return will be the same rate determined under paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allowable operating expenses include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operations supervision and engineering;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operations labor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Utilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ad valorem property taxes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Rent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Supplies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any other directly allocable and attributable operating or maintenance expense that you can document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Allowable maintenance expenses include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance of the transmission line;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance of equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintenance labor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transmission line is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment, or a return on capital investment in the transmission line. After a lessee has elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> To compute depreciation, you must use a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract, or other depreciation period acceptable to ONRR. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To compute depreciation, you must use a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract, or other depreciation period acceptable to ONRR. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in ownership of a transmission line does not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing transmission line costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With or without a change in ownership, you may depreciate a transmission line only once.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning of the period for which you are calculating the transmission deduction by the rate of return provided in paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> To compute a return on capital investment in the transmission line, multiply the allowable capital investment in the transmission line by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section. There is no allowance for depreciation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The rate of return must be 2.0 multiplied by the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. Redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Calculate the deduction for transmission costs based on your cost of transmitting electricity through each individual transmission line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)(1)</em> For new transmission facilities or arrangements, base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable electricity transmission costs for the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data for the transmission line or, if such data are not available, use estimates based on data for similar transmission lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For new transmission facilities or arrangements, base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable electricity transmission costs for the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data for the transmission line or, if such data are not available, use estimates based on data for similar transmission lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When actual cost information is available, you must amend your prior Form ONRR-2014 reports to reflect actual transmission costs deductions for each month for which you reported and paid based on estimated transmission costs. You must pay any additional royalties due (together with interest computed under Sec. 1218.302 of this chapter). You are entitled to a credit for or refund of any overpaid royalties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR may require you to submit arm's-length transmission contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents and all other data used to calculate the deduction. You must comply with any such requirements within the time ONRR specifies. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1212 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> At the completion of transmission line dismantlement and salvage operations, you may report a credit for or request a refund of royalties in an amount equal to the royalty rate times the amount by which actual transmission line dismantlement costs exceed actual income attributable to salvage of the transmission line.</p>
