                            <p class="depth0">When a District or Division Engineer determines that any of the conditions described in Sec. 644.166(b) exist in connection with any proposed land acquisition project for military purposes not yet authorized by law, or if authorized, not yet covered by a real estate directive, he will initiate the following actions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Planning report. A planning report will be developed and submitted in accordance with subpart A. The report will include the purpose for which the property is ``likely to be needed''; the estimated probable increase in value, if applicable; and the justification for negotiating for options under the authority cited in Sec. 644.166. The report will identify any real estate planning reports previously prepared which included the land in question. Any future planning reports relating to the same land will contain appropriate references to this report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Property identification. Upon receipt of authority to acquire options and determination that funds are available, the District or Division Engineer will obtain and verify ownership data. If it is deemed necessary, title evidence may be obtained in accordance with Sec. Sec. 644.61 through 644.72.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appraisal. Detailed tract appraisals will be prepared in accordance with subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procurement of options. (1) Negotiations for the option will be in accordance with procedures outlined in Sec. Sec. 644.83 through 644.85, except that ENG Form 2926, Option to Purchase

Real Property, will be used. An attempt should be made to include a provision in the option giving the Government the right to acquire all or part of the land covered by the option where the land held in a single ownership can be separated into definable parcels and the possibility exists that, as planning is developed, the entire tract will not be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Negotiations for the option will be in accordance with procedures outlined in Sec. Sec. 644.83 through 644.85, except that ENG Form 2926, Option to Purchase

Real Property, will be used. An attempt should be made to include a provision in the option giving the Government the right to acquire all or part of the land covered by the option where the land held in a single ownership can be separated into definable parcels and the possibility exists that, as planning is developed, the entire tract will not be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following instructions for the use of ENG Form 2926 will be followed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Insert amount to be paid for the option privilege. This amount cannot exceed five percent of the appraised value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the land has been separated into definable parcels in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the option should describe each parcel and provide for a separate purchase price inclusive of any severance damage, as well as an agreed purchase price for the entire tract. The amount to be paid for the option privilege will be apportioned among the separate parcels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The expiration date of the option on unauthorized projects should be far enough in advance to permit the insertion of a land acquisition line item in the next available budget; enactment of legislation; apportionment of funds by the Office of Management and Budget; clearance within the Department of Defense; clearance with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, if required; issuance of a real estate directive; and allotment of funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Since options obtained under this section will normally be recorded, ENG Form 2926 will be acknowledged in the form used in the jurisdiction in which the real property is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Report. When all options within the approval area have been acquired, and prior to their being exercised by the Government, a report will be made to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 including, but not limited to, the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Project identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Directive authorizing acquisition of options.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Number of tracts optioned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expiration date of options.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total acreage optioned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Total amount to be paid if options are excercised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Total amount paid for option privilege.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> One copy of each option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> One copy of each appraisal.</p>
