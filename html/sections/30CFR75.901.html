                            <p class="depth0">[Statutory Provisions]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Low- and medium-voltage three-phase alternating-current circuits  used underground shall contain either a direct or derived neutral which  shall be grounded through a suitable resistor at the power center, and a  grounding circuit, originating at the grounded side of the grounding  resistor, shall extend along with the power conductors and serve as a  grounding conductor for the frames of all the electrical equipment  supplied power from that circuit, except that the Secretary or his  authorized representative may permit   ungrounded low- and medium-voltage circuits to be used underground to  feed such stationary electrical equipment if such circuits are either  steel armored or installed in grounded rigid steel conduit throughout  their entire length. The grounding resistor, where required, shall be of  the proper ohmic value to limit the ground fault current to 25 amperes.  The grounding resistor shall be rated for maximum fault current  continuously and insulated from ground for a voltage equal to the phase- to-phase voltage of the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Diesel-powered electrical generators used as an alternative to  power centers for the purpose of moving equipment in, out, and around  the mine, and to perform work in areas where permissible equipment is  not required, must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The diesel engine powering the electrical generator must be  approved under 30 CFR part 7, subpart E.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A grounding resistor rated for the phase-to-phase voltage of the  system must be provided to limit the ground-fault current to not more  than 0.5 amperes. The grounding resistor(s) must be located:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator  frame; (see Figure I in appendix A to subpart J of this part) or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator  frame and between the wye-connected transformer secondary and the  transformer frame when an isolation transformer(s) is used and the  generator is supplying power to the other equipment; (see Figure II in  appendix A to subpart J of this part) or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator  frame when an auto-transformer is used. (see Figure III in appendix A to  subpart J of this part)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each three-phase output circuit of the generator must be  equipped with a sensitive ground fault relay. The protective relay must  be set to cause the circuit interrupting device that supplies power to  the primary windings of each transformer to trip and shut down the  diesel engine when a phase-to-frame fault of not more than 90  milliamperes occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each three-phase output circuit that supplies power to equipment  must be equipped with an instantaneous sensitive ground-fault relay that  will cause its respective circuit interrupting device(s) to trip and  cause shutdown of the diesel engine when a phase-to-frame fault occurs.  The grounded-phase protection must be set at not more than 90 milliamps.  Current transformers used for the ground-fault protection must be single  window-type and must be installed to encircle all three phase  conductors. Equipment safety grounding conductors must not pass through  or be connected in series with ground-fault current transformers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each three-phase circuit interrupting device must be provided  with a means to provide short-circuit, overcurrent, grounded-phase,  undervoltage, and ground wire monitoring protection. The instantaneous  only trip unit for the circuit interrupting device(s) in use must be  adjusted to trip at not more than 75 percent of the minimum available  short circuit current at the point where the portable cable enters the  equipment or the maximum allowable instantaneous settings specified in  Sec. 75.601-1, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The equipment portable cable length(s) must not exceed the  length(s) specified in 30 CFR part 18, appendix I, table 9,  Specifications for Cables Longer than 500 Feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Permanent label(s) listing the maximum circuit interrupting  device setting(s) and maximum portable cable length(s) must be installed  on each instantaneous trip unit or be maintained near each three-phase  circuit interrupting device. The permanent label(s) must be maintained  legibly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The circuit interrupting device that supplies three-phase power  circuit(s) to the equipment being powered must be limited to the use of  only one circuit interrupting device at a time when equipment is being  moved in, out, and around the mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The grounding system must include an MSHA-accepted ground wire  monitor system that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 75.902; or have  a No. 1/0 or larger external grounding conductor to bond and ground the  frames of all   equipment to the frame of the generator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> All trailing cables extending from the generator to equipment  must comply with Sec. 75.907.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A strain relief device must be provided on each end of the  trailing cables that extends between the generator and the piece of  equipment being powered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Prior to moving each piece of equipment or performing work, a  functional test of each ground fault and ground wire monitor system must  be performed by a qualified electrician who meets the requirements of  Sec. 75.153. The ground-fault circuit must be tested without subjecting  the circuit to an actual grounded phase condition. A record of each test  must be maintained and made available to authorized representatives of  the Secretary and to the miners in such mine.
