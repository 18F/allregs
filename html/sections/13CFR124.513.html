                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If approved by SBA, a Participant may enter into a  joint venture agreement with one or more other small business concerns,  whether or not 8(a) Participants, for the purpose of performing one or  more specific 8(a) contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a)  concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own,  and the agreement is fair and equitable and will be of substantial  benefit to the 8(a) concern. However, where SBA concludes that an 8(a)  concern brings very little to the joint venture relationship in terms of  resources and expertise other than its 8(a) status, SBA will not approve  the joint venture arrangement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Size of concerns to an 8(a) joint venture. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A joint venture  of at least one 8(a) Participant and one or more other business concerns  may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive 8(a)  procurement so long as each concern is small under the size standard  corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The size of at least one 8(a) Participant to the joint venture  is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code  assigned to the contract; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For a procurement having a revenue-based size standard, the  procurement exceeds half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS  code assigned to the contract; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the  procurement exceeds $10 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For sole source and competitive 8(a) procurements that do not  exceed the dollar levels identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  an 8(a) Participant entering into a joint venture agreement with another  concern is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with the other  concern with respect to performance of the 8(a) contract. The combined  annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint  venture must meet the size standard for the NAICS code assigned to the  8(a) contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)  of this section, a joint venture between a proteegee firm and its  approved mentor (see Sec. 124.520) will be deemed small provided the  proteegee qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the  NAICS code assigned to the procurement and has not reached the dollar  limit set forth in Sec. 124.519.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of joint venture agreement. Every joint venture  agreement to perform an 8(a) contract, including those between mentors  and proteegees authorized by Sec. 124.520, must contain a provision:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designating an 8(a) Participant as the managing venturer of the  joint venture. In an unpopulated joint venture or a joint venture  populated only with administrative personnel, the joint venture must  designate an employee of the 8(a) managing venturer as the project  manager responsible for performance of the contract. In a joint venture  populated with individuals intended to perform any contracts awarded to  the joint venture, the joint venture must otherwise demonstrate that  performance of the contract is controlled by the 8(a) managing venturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Stating that with respect to a separate legal entity joint  venture the 8(a) Participant(s) must own at least 51% of the joint  venture entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stating that the 8(a) Participant(s) must receive profits from  the joint venture commensurate with the work performed by the 8(a)  Participant(s), or in the case of a populated separate legal entity  joint venture commensurate with their ownership interests in the joint  venture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Providing for the establishment and administration of a special  bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require  the signature of all parties to the joint venture or designees for  withdrawal purposes. All payments due the joint venture for performance  on an 8(a) contract will be deposited in the special account; all  expenses incurred under the contract will be paid from the account as  well;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources  to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed  schedule of cost or value of each;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to  negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance,  including ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that  the joint venture and the 8(a) partner(s) to the joint venture will meet  the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure  performance of the 8(a) contract and to complete performance despite the  withdrawal of any member;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Designating that accounting and other administrative records  relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the 8(a)  Participant managing venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is  granted by the District Director or his/her designee upon written  request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Requiring the final original records be retained by the 8(a)  Participant managing venturer upon completion of the 8(a) contract  performed by the joint venture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Stating that quarterly financial statements showing cumulative  contract receipts and expenditures (including salaries of the joint  venture's principals) must be submitted to SBA not later than 45 days  after each operating quarter of the joint venture; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Stating that a project-end profit and loss statement, including  a statement of final profit distribution, must be submitted to SBA no  later than 90 days after completion of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance of work. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any 8(a) contract, including those  between mentors and proteegees authorized by Sec. 124.520, the joint  venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by  Sec. 124.510. For an unpopulated joint venture or a joint venture  populated only with one or more administrative personnel, the 8(a)  partner(s) to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work  performed by the joint venture. The work performed by 8(a) partners to a  joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions  so that they gain substantive experience. For a joint venture populated  with individuals intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint  venture, each 8(a) Participant to the joint venture must demonstrate  what it will gain from performance of the contract and how such  performance will assist in its business development.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In an unpopulated joint venture, where both the 8(a) and non- 8(a) partners are technically subcontractors, the amount of work done by  the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the 8(a) partner(s)  must be at least 40% of the total done by all partners. In determining  the amount of work done by a non-8(a) partner, all work done by the non- 8(a) partner and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will  be counted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a populated joint venture, a non-8(a) joint venture partner,  or any of its affiliates, may not act as a subcontractor to the joint  venture awardee, or to any other subcontractor of the joint venture,  unless the AA/BD determines that other potential subcontractors are not  available, or the joint venture is populated only with administrative  personnel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a non-8(a) joint venture partner seeks to do more work, the  additional work must generally be done through the joint venture, which  would require the 8(a) partner(s) to the joint venture to also do  additional work to meet the 40% requirement set forth in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a joint venture is populated only with administrative  personnel, the joint venture may subcontract performance to a non-8(a)  joint venture partner provided it also subcontracts work to the 8(a)  partner(s) in an amount sufficient to meet the 40% requirement. The  amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done  by the 8(a) partner(s) must be at least 40% of the total done by all  partners. In determining the amount of work done by a non-8(a) partner,  all work done by the non-8(a) partner and any of its affiliates at any  subcontracting tier will be counted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior approval by SBA. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA must approve a joint venture  agreement prior to the award of an 8(a) contract on behalf of the joint  venture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a joint venture has been established and approved by SBA  for one 8(a) contract, a second or third 8(a) contract may be awarded to  that joint venture provided an addendum to the joint venture agreement,  setting forth the performance requirements on that second or third  contract, is provided to and approved by SBA prior to contract award.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After approving the structure of the joint venture in connection  with the first contract, SBA will review only the addendums relating to  performance of work on successive contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SBA must approve the addendums prior to the award of any  successive 8(a) contract to the joint venture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contract execution. Where SBA has approved a joint venture, the  procuring activity will execute an 8(a) contract in the name of the  joint venture entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Amendments to joint venture agreement. All amendments to the  joint venture agreement must be approved by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Inspection of records. SBA may inspect the records of the joint  venture without notice at any time deemed necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Performance of work reports. An 8(a) Participant to a joint  venture must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable  performance of work requirements for each 8(a) contract it performs as a  joint venture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As part of its annual review, the 8(a) Participant(s) to the  joint venture must explain for each 8(a) contract performed during the  year how the performance of work requirements are being met for the  contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the completion of every 8(a) contract awarded to a joint  venture, the 8(a) Participant(s) to the joint venture must submit a  report to the local SBA district office explaining how the performance  of work requirements were met for the contract.
