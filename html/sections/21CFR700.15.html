                                Sec. 700.15  Use of certain halogenated salicylanilides as ingredients
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Halogenated salicylanilides (tribromsalan (TBS,3,4',5- tribromosalicylanilide), dibromsalan (DBS,4'5-dibromosalicylanilide),  metabromsalan (MBS, 3,5-dibromosalicylanilide) and 3,3',4,5'- tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA)) have been used as antimicrobial agents  for a variety of purposes in cosmetic products. These halogenated  salicylanilides are potent photosensitizers and cross-sensitizers and  can cause disabling skin disorders. In some instances, the  photosensitization may persist for prolonged periods as a severe  reaction without further exposure to these chemicals. Safer alternative  antimicrobial agents are available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These halogenated salicylanilides are deleterious substances  which render any cosmetic that contains them injurious to users.  Therefore, any cosmetic product that contains such a halogenated  salicylanilide as an ingredient at any level for any purpose is deemed  to be adulterated under section 601(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any cosmetic product containing these halogenated  salicylanilides as an ingredient that is initially introduced into  interstate commerce after December 1, 1975, that is not in compliance  with this section is subject to regulatory action.
