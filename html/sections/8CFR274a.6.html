However, should a state employment agency choose to do so, it must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complete the verification process in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part provided that the individual may not present receipts in lieu of documents in order to complete the verification process as otherwise

permitted by Sec. 274a.2(b)(1)(vi) of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete the verification process prior to referral for all individuals for whom a certification is required to be issued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with the provisions of section 274A of the Act. A state employment agency which chooses to verify employment eligibility of individuals pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part shall comply with all provisions of section 274A of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State employment agency certification. (1) A state employment agency which chooses to verify employment eligibility pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall issue to an employer who hires an individual referred for employment by the agency, a certification as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The certification shall be transmitted by the state employment agency directly to the employer, personally by an agency official, or by mail, so that it will be received by the employer within 21 business days of the date that the referred individual is hired. In no case shall the certification be transmitted to the employer from the state employment agency by the individual referred. During this period:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A state employment agency which chooses to verify employment eligibility pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall issue to an employer who hires an individual referred for employment by the agency, a certification as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The certification shall be transmitted by the state employment agency directly to the employer, personally by an agency official, or by mail, so that it will be received by the employer within 21 business days of the date that the referred individual is hired. In no case shall the certification be transmitted to the employer from the state employment agency by the individual referred. During this period:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The job order or other appropriate referral form issued by the state employment agency to the employer, on behalf of the individual who is referred and hired, shall serve as evidence, with respect to that individual, of the employer's compliance with the provisions of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a telephonically authorized job referral by the state employment agency to the employer, an appropriate annotation by the employer shall be made and shall serve as evidence of the job order.

Should a state agency choose to verify employment eligibility and to issue a certification to an employer relating to an individual who is hired for a period of employment not to exceed 3 days in duration, it must verify employment eligibility and issue certifications relating to all such individuals. Should a state employment agency choose not to verify employment eligibility or issue certifications to employers who hire, for a period not to exceed 3 days in duration, agency-referred individuals, the agency shall notify employers that, as a matter of policy, it does not perform verifications for individuals hired for that length of time, and that the employers must complete the identity and employment eligibility requirements pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part. Such notification may be incorporated into the job order or other referral form utilized by the state employment agency as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employer to whom a state employment agency issues a certification relating to an individual referred by the agency and hired by the employer, shall be deemed to have complied with the verification requirements of Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part provided that the employer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reviews the identifying information contained in the certification to ensure that it pertains to the individual hired;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Observes the signing of the certification by the individual at the time of its receipt by the employer as provided for in paragraph (d)(13) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Complies with the provisions of Sec. 274a.2(b)(1)(vii) of this part by either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Updating the state employment agency certification in lieu of Form I-9, upon expiration of the employment authorization date, if any, which was noted on the certification issued by the state employment agency pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> By no longer employing an individual upon expiration of his or her employment authorization date noted on the certification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Retains the certification in the same manner prescribed for Form I-9 in Sec. 274a.2(b)(2) of this part, to wit, three years after the date of the hire or one year after the date the individual's employment is terminated, whichever is later; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Makes it available for inspection to officers of the Service or the Department of Labor, pursuant to the provisions of section 274A(b)(3) of the Act, and Sec. 274a.2(b)(2) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure by an employer to comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section shall constitute a violation of section 274A(a)(2) of the Act and shall subject the employer to the penalties contained in section 274A(e)(4) of the Act, and Sec. 274a.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards for state employment agency certifications.

A state employment agency may retain a Form I-9 either in its original form, or on microfilm or microfiche.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retention of state employment agency certifications. A certification issued by a state employment agency pursuant to this section shall be retained:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By a state employment agency, for a period of three years from the date that the individual was last referred by the agency and hired by an employer, and in a manner to be determined by the agency which will enable the prompt retrieval of the information

contained on the original certification for comparison with the relating Form I-9;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By the employer, in the original form, and in the same manner and location as the employer has designated for retention of Forms I-9, and for the period of time provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> State employment agency verification requirements in the case of an individual who was previously referred and certified.
