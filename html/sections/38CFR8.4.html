                            <p class="depth0">The insured under a National Service life insurance policy which is  not lapsed may authorize the monthly deduction of premiums from  disability compensation, death compensation, dependency and indemnity  compensation, retirement pay, disability pension, or death pension that  may be due and payable to him under any laws administered by the  Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with the following  provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The authorization may be made by an insured or the insured's  legal representative. If the authorization is made by the insured's  legal representative, it must be in writing over the signature of the  representative and forwarded to the Department of Veterans Affairs along  with a copy of the document which evidences the individual's authority  to act on behalf of the insured. If an insured is incompetent and has no  legal representative and has a spouse to whom benefits are being paid  pursuant to Part 13 of this chapter, the spouse may authorize payment of  insurance premiums through the deduction system. If an insured is  incompetent and has no legal representative and an institutional award  has been made in his or her behalf, the authorization may be executed by  the Director of the field facility in which the insured is hospitalized  or receiving domiciliary care, and in appropriate cases by the chief  officers of State hospitals or other institutions to whom similar awards  may have been approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The monthly disability compensation, death compensation,  dependency and indemnity compensation, retirement pay, disability  pension, or death pension so due and payable must be equal to, or in  excess of, the amount of the insurance premium figured on a monthly  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The authorization may be cancelled by the insured at any time.  Such cancellation will be effective on the first day of the month  following the month in which it is received by the Department of  Veterans Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the benefits payable to the insured are apportioned under the  regulations of the Department of Veterans   Affairs now in effect or hereafter issued, the deduction authorized by  the insured shall be from that portion awarded to the insured under such  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The deduction authorized by a policyholder issued insurance  under 38 U.S.C. 1925 will be automatically adjusted by the Department of  Veterans Affairs to take cognizance of any premium adjustment made by  the Secretary on such insurance provided the benefit payments due and  payable to the insured are of an amount sufficient to pay the monthly  insurance premium.
