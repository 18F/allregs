A State may file a civil action under section 218(t) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-509 requesting a district court of the United States to review any decision the Commissioner makes under section 218(s) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-509 concerning the assessment of an amount due, the allowance of a credit or refund, or the disallowance of a claim for credit or refund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the civil action must be filed. A State must file the civil action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the State's capital is located. If the civil action is brought by an interstate instrumentality, it must file the civil action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the instrumentality's principal office is located. The district court's judgment is final except that it is subject to review in the same manner as judgments of the court in other civil actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No interest on credit or refund of overpayment. SSA has no authority to pay interest to a State after final judgment of a court involving a credit or refund of an overpayment made under section 218 of the Act.
