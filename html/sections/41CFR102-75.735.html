                            <p class="depth0">If, after considering other uses for the property, the disposal agency determines that the property should be made available for replacement housing under section 218, it must transfer the property to the designated State agency on such terms and conditions as will protect the United States' interests, including the payment or the

agreement to pay to the United States all amounts received by the State agency from any sale, lease, or other disposition of the property for such housing. The sale, lease, or other disposition of the property by the State agency must be at the fair market value as approved by the disposal agency, unless a compelling justification is offered for disposal of the property at less than fair market value. Disposal of the property at less than fair market value must also be approved by the disposal agency.</p>
