to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the following general requirements for flow, pressure, pH, and operating temperature measurement devices:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must collect data using the continuous monitoring system at all times the affected SSI unit is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions that occur during periods specified in Sec. 60.4880(a)(7)(i), repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). Any such periods that you do not collect data using the continuous monitoring system constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must collect continuous parameter monitoring system data in accordance with Sec. 60.13(e)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels.

Any such periods that do not coincide with a monitoring system malfunction, as defined in Sec. 60.4930, constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You must use all the data collected during all periods except those periods specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) of this section in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operate and maintain your continuous monitoring system according to your monitoring plan required under Sec. 60.4880. Additionally:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For carrier gas flow rate monitors (for activated carbon injection), during the performance test conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.4885, you must demonstrate that the system is maintained within 5 percent accuracy, according to the procedures in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carrier gas pressure drop monitors (for activated carbon injection), during the performance test conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.4885, you must demonstrate that the system is maintained within 5 percent accuracy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must operate and maintain your bag leak detection system in continuous operation according to your monitoring plan required under Sec. 60.4880.
