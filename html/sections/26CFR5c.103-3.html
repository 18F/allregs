                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In the case of a sale and leaseback transaction qualifying under  section   168(f)(8), where the lessee's rental payments are substantially equal in  timing and amount to the principal and interest payments on the lessor's  note, the arbitrage provisions of section 103(c) and Sec. Sec. 1.103- 13, 1.103-14, and 1.103-15 shall apply to any obligations of the lessee  (or party related to the lessee) without regard to the section 168(f)(8)  lease transaction.  [T.D. 7800, 46 FR 63257, Dec. 31, 1981]    Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-1  Special rules for leases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of  1954 provides special rules for characterizing certain agreements as  leases and characterizing the parties to the agreement as lessors and  lessees for Federal tax law purposes. These rules apply only with  respect to qualified leased property. If all the requirements of section  168(f)(8) and Sec. Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2 through 5c.168(f)(8)-11 are met,  then the agreement shall be treated as a lease, and the party  characterized as the lessor shall be treated as the owner of the  property. In such case, the lessor shall be deemed to have entered into  the lease in the course of carrying on a trade or business and shall be  allowed accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) deductions under section  168 and the investment tax credit under section 38 with respect to the  leased property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(A)(iii)</em>, the determination of whether any amount is  paid or incurred to another person for the right to use personal  property in the conduct of qualified research shall be made without  regard to the characterization of the transaction as a lease under  section 168(f)(8). Thus, if a lessee would be considered the owner of  the property without regard to section 168(f)(8), any amounts paid by  the lessee under the lease shall not be considered amounts paid or  incurred for the right to use the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other factors disregarded. If an agreement meets the  requirements of section 168(f)(8) and Sec. Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2 through  5c.168(f)(8)-11, the following factors will not be taken into account in  determining whether the transaction is a lease:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the lessor or lessee must take the tax benefits into  account in order to determine that a profit is made from the  transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fact that the lessee is the nominal owner of the property  for State or local law purposes (e.g., has legal title to the property)  and retains the burdens, benefits, and incidents of ownership (such as  payment of taxes and maintenance charges with respect to the property);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether or not a person other than the lessee may be able to use  the property after the lease term;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The fact that the property may (or must) be bought or sold at  the end of the lease term at a fixed or determinable price that is more  or less than its fair market value at that time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fact that the lessee or related party has provided financing  or has guaranteed financing for the transaction (other than for the  lessor's minimum 10 percent investment); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The fact that the obligation of any person is subject to any  contingency or offset agreement. See, for example, the rent and debt  service offset in Example (2) of paragraph (e).  An agreement that meets the requirements of section 168(f)(8) and  Sec. Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2 through 5c.168(f)(8)-11 may be treated by the  parties as a lease for Federal Tax law purposes only. Similarly, a sale  by the lessee of the leased property to the lessor in a transaction  where the property is leased back under an agreement that meets the  requirements of section 168(f)(8) may be treated by the parties as a  sale for Federal tax law purposes only. The agreements need not comply  with State law requirements concerning transfer of title, recording,  etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Ownership in one of the parties. Notwithstanding any other  section, if neither the lessor nor the lessee would be the owner of the  property without regard to section 168(f)(8), or, if any party with an  economic interest in the property (other than the lessor or lessee or  any subsequent transferee of their interests) claims ACRS deductions or  any investment tax credit with respect to the leased property, an  election under section 168(f)(8) with respect to such property shall be  void as of the   date of the execution of the lease agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The application of section 168(f)(8) and Sec. Sec.  5c.168(f)(8)-2 through 5c.168(f)(8)-11 may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X Corp. wishes to acquire a $1 million piece of  equipment which is ``qualified leased property'' as defined in section  168(f)(8)(D). The equipment has a 10-year economic life and falls within  the 5-year ACRS class. Y Corp. is a person meeting the qualifications  set forth in section 168(f)(8)(B)(i) and Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-3 and wishes  to be the owner of the property for Federal tax law purposes. Y  therefore purchases the equipment from the manufacturer for $1 million,  paying $200,000 in cash and borrowing $800,000 from a bank (payable over  9 years and requiring nine equal annual payments of principal and  interest of $168,000). Y then leases the equipment to X under an  agreement providing for nine annual rental payments of $168,000, and the  parties elect in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2  to have the provisions of section 168(f)(8) apply. The timing and amount  of the rental payments required to be made by X (the ``lessee-user'')  under the lease will be exactly equal to the timing and amount of the  principal and interest payments that Y (the ``lessor'') will be required  to make to the bank under its purchase money note. Under these  circumstances, Y is treated as the owner and lessor of the property for  Federal tax law purposes; it therefore is entitled to the investment tax  credit and the ACRS deductions with respect to the property. Y's basis  in the property is $1 million. Y must report the rent as income and will  be entitled to deduct the interest on the purchase money note. The  aggregate payments required to be made by X under the lease are treated  as rent in accordance with Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-7 and are deductible as  such.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that X  purchases the equipment for $1 million and wishes to transfer ownership  of the property for Federal tax law purposes to Y under a sale and  leaseback arrangement. Accordingly, X sells the property to Y for  $200,000 in cash (which represents the agreed upon compensation for the  tax benefits to be enjoyed by Y as lessor) plus a 9-year, $800,000 note  calling for nine $168,000 annual payments of principal and interest. Y  then leases the property back to X under an agreement providing for nine  annual rental payments of $168,000. The parties elect in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2 to have the provisions of section  168(f)(8) apply. The timing and amount of the rental payments required  to be made by X (as the lessee-user) under the lease will be exactly  equal to the timing and amount of the principal and interest payments  that Y will be required to make to X under Y's purchase money note, so  that the only cash transferred between X and Y is the $200,000 down  payment. Y's obligation to make debt service payments on the note is  contingent on X's obligation to make rental payments under the lease.  Under these circumstances, Y is treated as the owner and lessor of the  property for Federal tax law purposes; it therefore is entitled to the  investment tax credit and ACRS deductions with respect to the property.  Y's basis in the property is $1 million. Y must report the rent as  income and will be entitled to deduct the interest on the purchase money  note. No gain or loss will be recognized by X on the sale of the  property since the sale price equals X's basis in the property. X must  report as income the interest paid by Y on the note and will be entitled  to a deduction for the rental payments it makes under the lease in  accordance with Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-7.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). Assume that in both examples (1) and (2) X has an  option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for $1.00.  The fact that the property may (or must) be bought or sold at the end of  the lease term at a fixed or determinable price that is more or less  than its fair market value is not taken into account in determining the  status of the transactions as leases under section 168(f)(8).  [T.D. 7791, 46 FR 51907, Oct. 23, 1981, as amended by T.D. 7795, 46 FR  56148, Nov. 13, 1981]    Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-2  Election to characterize transaction as a section  168(f)(8) lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The agreement must be in  writing and must state that all of the parties to the agreement agree to  characterize it as a lease for purposes of Federal tax law and elect to  have the provisions of section 168(f)(8) apply to the transaction. The  agreement   must also name the party who will be treated as the lessor and the party  who will be treated as the lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information return concerning the election. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as  provided in subdivision (ii), for each lease agreement, the lessor and  lessee must jointly file Form 6793, Safe Harbor Lease Information  Return, concerning their election under section 168(f)(8).

Unless the failure to file  timely is shown to be due to reasonable cause, the failure to file the  information return timely shall void the section 168(f)(8) election as  of the date of the execution of the lease agreement.

If  either the lessor or the lessee reasonably expects to lease property  with an aggregate basis of more than $1,000,000, then both parties must  disclose their transaction costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an agreement executed before January 1, 1982,  only the lessor is required to file the information return described in  paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and the return must be postmarked  not later than January 31, 1982. Unless the failure to file timely is  shown to be due to reasonable cause, or unless the lessee files the  information return postmarked by January 31, 1982, the lessor's failure  to file the information return timely shall be a disqualifying event as  of February 1, 1982, which shall cause an agreement to cease to be  treated as a lease under section 168(f)(8). For the Federal income tax  consequences of a disqualifying event, see Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the information return described in paragraph (a)(3)  (i) and (ii) shall be filed by each party with its timely filed Federal  income tax return for its taxable year during which the lease term  begins.

Except in the case of transactions  described in subparagraph (6), of this paragraph, if the lessee (or any  transferee of the lessee's interest) sells or assigns its interest in  the lease or in the property, the agreement will cease to be  characterized as a lease under section 168(f)(8) as of the time of the  sale or assignment unless the transferee furnishes to the lessor within  60 days following the transfer the transferee's written consent to take  the property subject to the lease, and the transferee and lessor file a  statement with their timely filed Federal income tax returns for the  taxable year in which the transfer occurs containing the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the lessor  and the transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The district director's office with which the income tax  returns of the lessor and transferee are filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Confirmation of the transferee's consent.

In the case of an agreement executed after May 31, 1982,  where the lessee's interest in the lease or in the property is sold or  assigned in a bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, a court-supervised  foreclosure, or in any similar proceeding for the relief or protection  of insolvent debtors in Federal or State court, the agreement will  continue to be characterized as a lease under section 168(f)(8) and the  purchaser or assignee shall take the property subject to the lease if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the consummation of the sale or assignment, the lessor  gives written notice of its Federal income tax ownership to the judicial  or administrative body having jurisdiction over the proceeding and to  the debtor in possession of the interest or, if at such time a trustee,  receiver or similar person has been appointed by the court, to the  person appointed. The notice must contain a request that the court and  the debtor or the person appointed provide a copy of the notice to the  purchaser or assignee prior to the consummation of the sale or  assignment. Within 60 days following the sale or assignment, the lessor  must provide notice of its Federal income tax ownership and copies of  the lease agreement, and, in the case of a sale and leaseback  transaction, the lessor's purchase money obligation, to the purchaser or  assignee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The lessor files a statement with its timely filed Federal  income tax return for the taxable year in which the sale or assignment  occurs containing the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the lessor  and the purchaser or assignee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The district director's office with which the Federal income tax  returns of the lessor and purchaser or assignee are filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prior to the consummation of the sale or assignment, all  secured lenders of the lessee with interests in the property, which  interests arose not later than the time the lessee first used the  property under the lease (and   which were perfected in accordance with applicable local law),  specifically either exclude or release in writing the Federal income tax  ownership of the property from their interests.  The purchaser or assignee of the interest with respect to which this  paragraph applies shall file a statement with its timely filed Federal  income tax return for the taxable year in which the sale or assignment  occurs containing the information described in subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph. If the interest is subsequently transferred (other than in  a bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, court-supervised foreclosure,  or similar proceeding) during the term of the lease, the agreement will  continue to be characterized as a lease under section 168(f)(8) and the  transferee will take the property subject to the lease if either (A) the  lessor gives the transferee, prior to the transfer, a copy of the lease,  written notice of its Federal income tax ownership, and, in the case of  a sale and leaseback transaction, a copy of the lessor's purchase money  obligation, and the lessor files a statement with its timely filed  Federal income tax return as described in subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph, or (B) within 60 days following the transfer, the  transferee agrees in writing to take the property subject to the lease  and the lessor and transferee file a statement with their timely filed  Federal income tax returns within the time and in the manner described  in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. However, an agreement will not  continue to be characterized as a lease under this subparagraph if,  under another applicable provision, it would cease to be characterized  as a lease. See Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-8 for the Federal income tax  consequences where an agreement ceased to be characterized as a lease  under section 168(f)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Consequences of taking the property subject to the lease  agreement. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-1 through  5c168(f)(8)-11, in a situation where a transferee of a lessee's interest  acquires the property subject to the lease, the transferee shall be  deemed to have acquired a leasehold interest in the property equal to  the remaining lease term, any unpaid obligation of the lessor arising in  connection with the sale of the property by the original lessee in a  sale and leaseback transaction, and any option of the lessee to purchase  the property. Any consideration paid by the transferee for the property  shall be allocated to the lessor's obligation to the extent of the  unpaid balance of the obligation. Any excess over the unpaid balance  shall be allocated between the leasehold interest and the purchase  option in proportion to their relative fair market values. As the new  lessee, the transferee shall not be entitled to claim any ACRS deduction  with respect to the property while the lease remains in effect and shall  not be entitled to any investment tax credit with respect to the  property. The transferee shall report interest income on the lessor's  obligation, and shall be entitled to deduct the rent paid under the  lease, in accordance with Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-7. In addition, the  transferee shall be entitled to amortize the portion of its cost  allocable to the leasehold interest. Coversely, as long as the lease  remains in effect, the lessor will continue to be recognized as the  owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes, shall be required  to report rents due under the lease, and shall be entitled to deduct  interest on its obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> lease executed on or before May 31,  1982, may elect to have the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this  section apply in the case of a sale or assignment of the lessee's  interest in the lease or in the property in a bankruptcy, receivership,  liquidation, court-supervised foreclosure, or similar proceeding. The  election of the lessor with respect to any leased property may be made  at any time prior to the consummation of any sale or assignment of such  property in a bankruptcy, etc., or similar proceeding, by complying with  the provisions of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The application of the provisions of this section may  be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X Corp. maintains its books and records for Federal tax  law purposes on a calendar year basis. On February 1, 1981, X acquires  certain equipment for use in its   business, and the equipment is deemed to be placed in service on that  date within the meaning of Sec. 5c.163(f)(8)-6(b)(2)(i). On November 1,  1981, X sells the equipment to Y and leases it back under a lease in  which the parties elect to have the provisions of section 168(f)(8)  apply. The election is considered timely for purposes of making Y the  owner of the property under section 168(f)(8) since the lease agreement  was executed before November 14, 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that X  Corp.'s taxable year ends on February 28, 1981. X claimed the investment  tax credit and depreciation deductions with respect to the property in  its return filed April 1, 1981. The lease will qualify for safe harbor  treatment under section 168(f)(8) provided X, within 3 months after the  lease agreement was executed, files an amended return pursuant to Sec.  5c.168(f)(8)-6(b)(2)(ii) for its taxable year ending February 28, 1981,  in which X foregoes its right to claim any investment tax credit or ACRS  deductions with respect to the property subject to the lease.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). X Corp. (as lessee) sells certain new equipment to Y  Corp. (as lessor) and leases it back under a section 168(f)(8) lease.  During the term of the lease X sells its interest in the property to T  Corp. (other than in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding), and T does not  give Y a written consent to take the property subject to the leased. The  agreement ceases to be treated as a lease under section 168(f)(8) as of  the date of the sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (3) except that  the sale of the property takes place while X is under the jurisdiction  of a court in a bankruptcy proceeding. All lenders of X having perfected  interests in the property that arose by the time the property was first  used under the lease have specifically either excluded or released the  ownership of the property for Federal income tax purposes from their  interests. Within the required time periods, Y gives appropriate  notification to the court, the bankruptcy trustee, and T that the  property is subject to the lease and files the required statement with  its Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the sale  occurs. The agreement continues to be treated as a lease under section  168(f)(8). T will take the property subject to the lease. T must  allocate the purchase price among the lessor's note, the leasehold  interest, and the option (if any) to purchase the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example (5). The facts are the same as in example (4), except that  one lender of X having a perfected and timely interest in the property  does not specifically exclude or release the Federal income tax  ownership of the property from its interest. The agreement will cease to  be treated as a lease under section 168(f)(8) as of the date of the  transfer to T. The result would be the same if Y failed to furnish any  of the notices required by subdivision (i) of paragraph (a) and (6) or  failed to file a statement as required by subdivision (ii) of paragraph  (a)(6).</p><p class="depth0">Example (6). The facts are the same as in example (4). In addition,  during the term of the lease T transfers the property to U Corp. and Y  fails to furnish U with written notice that the property is subject to  the lease prior to the sale and U refuses to agree to consent to the  lease agreement. The agreement will cease to be treated as a lease under  section 168(f)(8) as of the date of the transfer to U. The result would  be the same if Y furnished U with timely written notice of its tax  ownership but failed to file the required statement with its tax return  for its taxable year in which the sale occurred.

If  any partner of a partnership described in paragraph (a)(2) ceases to be  a corporation described in paragraph (a)(1), the partnership entity  shall cease to be a qualified lessor. Similarly, if any beneficiary of a  trust described in paragraph (a)(3) ceases to be a corporation described  in paragraph (a)(1), the trust shall cease to be a qualified lessor. See  Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-8 for the Federal income tax consequences of such a  disqualification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> One tax owner per property. Only one person may be a qualified  lessor under section 168(f)(8) with respect to leased property. Thus,  property that is subject to a lease under section 168(f)(8) may not be  subleased under a lease for which a section 168(f)(8) election is made.  In addition, if a lessor sells or assigns in a taxable transaction its  interest in a section 168(f)(8) lease or in the underlying property, the  lease shall cease to qualify under section 168(f)(8) and no other lease  may be executed under section 168(f)(8) with respect to the property.  The preceding sentence applies to a sale or assignment of its interest  by a partner of a lessor that is a partnership described in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section or by a beneficiary of a lessor that is a trust  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. See Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-8  for the Federal income tax consequences where a lease ceases to qualify  under section 168(f)(8). However, lease brokers, agents, etc., may, for  example, prepare executory contracts with the lessee whereby the  broker's assignee may execute a lease as lessor, and, if the  requirements of section 168(f)(8) and Sec. Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-1 through  5c.168(f)(8)-11 are met, the lease will qualify under section 168(f)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of paragraph (c) may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X Corp. (as lessee) sells certain new equipment to Y  Corp. (as lessor) and leases it back under a section 168(f)(8) lease.  Within 3 months after the property was placed in service, Y assigns its  interest in the lease to Z. Upon the transfer to Z, the lease will no  longer qualify for treatment under section 168(f)(8). The property may  not thereafter be the subject of a section 168(f)(8) lease.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). X Corp., which wishes to acquire certain equipment for  use in its business and to transfer ownership of the property for  Federal income tax law purposes, purchases the equipment and enters into  an executory contract with LB, a lease broker, under which X agrees to  execute a section 168(f)(8) lease as lessee with a third party lessor.  At a later date (but within the prescribed 3-month period), LB arranges  for X and T Corp. (which wishes to secure Federal income tax law  ownership) to execute a lease agreement in accordance with Sec.  5c.168(f)(8)-2. The lease will qualify for treatment under section  168(f)(8).

Under section 168(f)(8)(B)(ii), an agreement  will not be characterized as a lease for purposes of section 168(f)(8)  unless the qualified lessor has a minimum at risk investment which, at  the time the property is placed in service under the lease and at all  times during the term of the lease, is not less than 10 percent of the  adjusted basis of the leased property. As the adjusted basis of the  leased property is reduced by capital cost recovery deductions, the  minimum investment required will also be reduced to 10 percent of the  revised adjusted basis, until the adjusted basis has been completely  recovered, at which time no minimum investment will be required.  Financing provided by the lessee or a party related to the lessee, such  as a recourse note given by the lessor to the lessee, will not be taken  into account in determining the lessor's minimum investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3))</em> shall reduce the amount the  lessor is considered to have at risk by the amount of the option price  at the time the option becomes exercisable.    Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-5  Term of lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, the lease agreement must  provide for a term that does not exceed the maximum term described in  paragraph (b) of this section; such term must also at least equal the  minimum term described in paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maximum term. For purposes of section 168(f)(8)(B)(iii) and this  section, the term of the lease may not exceed the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 90 percent of the useful life of the property under section 167,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 150 percent of the asset depreciation range (ADR) present class  life (``midpoint'') of such property, applicable as of January 1, 1981  (without regard to section 167(m)(4)), published in Rev. Proc. 77-10,  1977-1 C. B. 548, and revisions thereto.  Solely for purposes of this paragraph (b), ``useful life'' means the  period when the leased asset can reasonably be expected to be  eonomically useful in anyone's trade or business; such term does not  mean the period during which the lessor expects to lease the property.  Any option to extend the term of the lease, whether or not at fair  market value rent, must be included in the term of the lease for  purposes of this paragraph. If several different pieces of property are  the subject of a single lease, the maximum allowable term for such lease  will be measured with respect to the property with the shortest life. In  no case, however, will the lease term qualify under this section if such  term with respect to any piece of property is less than the minimum term  described in paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em>  for the recovery property class of the leased property. For example, if  a piece of leased equipment is in the 5-year recovery property class,  the lease agreement must have a minimum term of 5 years. In general, the  determination of whether property is 3-year recovery property, 5-year  recovery property, etc., in the hands of the lessor will be based on the  characterization of the property in the hands of the owner as determined  without regard to the section 168(f)(8) lease. Thus, for example,  property which is public utility property or RRB replacement property  absent the section 168(f)(8) lease will be characterized as such in the  hands of the lessor for purposes of section 168(f)(8). However, with  respect to RRB replacement property, the transitional rule of section  168(f)(3) shall be inapplicable to the lessor. In addition, any election  under section 168(b)(3) by the lessor with respect to the class of  recovery property to which the qualified leased property is assigned  shall apply to the leased property in determining the term of the lease.  A lease term that does not exceed the term required to satisfy the  minimum lease term of this paragraph will be deemed to comply with the  maximum lease term described in paragraph (b) if such minimum lease term  exceeds such maximum lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X Corp. (as lessee) and Y Corp. (as lessor) enter into  a lease which they elect to be treated under section 168(f)(8) with  respect to a chemical manufacturing facility that will also generate  steam for use in the production of electricity. The assets comprising  the chemical plant are described in ADR guideline class 28.0 (midpoint  life of 9.5 years), and the assets comprising the steam plant are  described in ADR class 00.4 (midpoint life of 22 years). To satisfy the  maximum lease term requirement of section 168(f)(8)(B)(iii)(II) and  Sec. 5c.168 (f)(8)-5(b), the lease term may not exceed 14.25 years (150  percent of the 9.5 year midpoint life of the chemical plant).</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  the chemical plant and the steam plant are the subject of separate  leases. For purposes of section 168(f)(8)(B)(iii)(II) and Sec.  5c.168(f)(8)-5 (b), the maximum term of the lease with respect to the  chemical plant is 14.25 years (150 percent of 9.5 years) and the maximum  term of the lease with respect to the steam plant is 33 years (150  percent of 22 years).

These costs include legal and investment banking fees and  printing costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of this paragraph (a)(2) may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X, an airline, contracts to have an airplane  constructed for a fixed price of $10 million. Prior to completion of  construction of the airplane, the value of the airplane increases to $11  million. X buys the airplane at the contract price of $10 million and,  before it is placed in service, sells the airplane at its fair market  value of $11 million to Y and then leases it back. The lease will not  qualify for safe harbor protection under section 168(f)(8) because the  lessor's adjusted basis in the airplane exceeds the lessee's adjusted  basis.

Since the equipment would not  be new section 38 property of N if N had acquired it by virtue of  section 48(a)(4) (relating to exception from   definition of section 38 property for certain property used by certain  tax-exempt organizations), the equipment is not qualified leased  property and the lease does not qualify under section 168(f)(8).

Before the date that the property is placed in service (as defined in  Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-6(b)(2)(i)), the property is not new section 38  property.

R uses the rolling stock within and without the  United States, but predominantly outside the United States within the  meaning of section 48(a)(2)(A). Section 48(a)(2)(B)(ii) is inapplicable  to R because R is neither a domestic railroad corporation nor a United  States person; therefore, the rolling stock cannot be section 38  property to R.

The property is  considered to be new section 38 property to X under paragraph (b)(1). X  is not allowed any investment tax credit or ACRS deductions with respect  to the property in 1982 because the property is not considered to have  been placed in service for purposes other than determining whether it is  qualified leased property until it is used under the lease under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph (2).

The cost of reconditioning  amounts to an additional $20,000. K would be entitled to a basis of  $20,000 in computing its qualified investment in new section 38 property  for 1985. In May 1985, K enters into a sale and leaseback transaction  with L Corp. with respect to the reconditioned parts of the machine that  are new section 38 property to K. K and L elect to have section  168(f)(8) apply. Assuming that the adjusted basis of the leased property  is the same to L as it is to K, the property qualifies as qualified  leased property under section 168(f)(8)(D)(ii) and L is considered the  tax owner of the property. Since, for purposes other than determining   whether property is qualified leased property, the property is deemed  originally placed in service not earlier than the date the property is  used under the lease, the property is new section 38 property to L and L  may claim the investment tax credit (and ACRS deductions) with respect  to the leased property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualified mass commuting vehicle. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A qualified mass commuting  vehicle as defined in section 103(b)(9) will constitute qualified leased  property for purposes of section 168(f)(8)(D)(iii) and this section  provided all of the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least part (as, for example, 5 percent) of the financing for  the purchase of such vehicle must be derived from proceeds of  obligations the interest on which is excludable from income under  section 103(a)(1) (whether or not such obligations are described in  section 103(b)(4)(I));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The vehicle must be recovery property (i.e., it must have been  first placed in service by the lessee after December 31, 1980); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The vehicle must not have been previously leased under a section  168(f)(8) lease by the lessee.

On July 1, 1981, a unit of city X, X Transit Authority  (XTA), purchases 100 buses after receiving an UMTA grant for 80 percent  of their purchase price. Fifteen percent of the purchase price is  financed with a combination of State and local governmental grants and 5  percent is financed with proceeds from an issue of tax-exempt  obligations described in section 103(b)(4)(I). Because UMTA financed an  80 percent interest in the 100 buses, XTA may lease under section  168(f)(8) only a 20 percent interest in each bus. If XTA were to lease  100 percent of 20 buses, only 20 percent of such buses would be deemed  to be leased under a safe harbor lease.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  UMTA has not yet approved XTA's application in 1981. Pending the UMTA  approval, XTA purchases and places in service 20 buses in July 1981. The  20 buses are financed with tax-exempt obligations described in section  103(b)(4)(I). On December 15, 1981, XTA sells a 100 percent interest in  these 20 buses to Corporation M and leases them back under a lease in  which the parties elect to have the provisions of section 168(f)(8)  apply. M is a calendar-year taxpayer and claims an ACRS deduction with  respect to the buses on its return for taxable year 1981. On July 1,  1982, UMTA approves XTA's grant application, thus enabling XTA to  purchase an additional 80 buses. Because 80 percent of the original 20  buses are deemed to have been financed by UMTA beginning on July 1,  1982, the safe harbor lease terminates with respect to an undivided 80  percent interest in the 20 buses. If XTA would be considered the owner  of the buses without regard to section 168(f)(8), the termination will  result in a deemed sale of an undivided 80 percent interest in the 20  buses by M to XTA. The amount realized by M on the sale will include a  proportionate part of the outstanding amount of M's debt plus the sum of  any other consideration received by M. M will realize gain or loss,  depending upon its basis, with applicable section 1245 recapture.  However, XTA may lease the 20 percent interest in the 80 new buses it  purchased in 1982 which is deemed to have been financed with non-Federal  funds.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). The facts are the same as in example (2) except that  the grant approved by UMTA is used to purchase and renovate a bus garage  facility. Eighty percent of the original 20 buses are deemed to have  been financed by UMTA beginning on July 1, 1982. The lease would still  terminate with respect to an undivided 80 percent interest in the  vehicles. XTA cannot lease the garage facility under 168(f)(8) because  it does not constitute a qualified mass commuting vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (2) except that on  December 15, 1981, XTA sells and leases back only a 20 percent interest  in the 20 buses acquired in July 1981.   When the UMTA grant is later approved, the lease will not terminate with  respect to any portion of the 20 buses. In addition, XTA may lease the  20 percent interest in the 80 new buses purchased in 1982 and deemed to  have been financed with non-Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0">Example (5). On August 1, 1982, UMTA approves a grant for a major 5- year capital expenditure program to improve city Y's rapid rail transit  system. None of the funds relating to this UMTA-funded project, provided  either by UMTA or by city Y, will be used to purchase qualified mass  commuting vehicles. Instead, a number of rapid rail cars and buses will  be purchased entirely with funds provided with a combination of grants  by the State and city governments and of proceeds from an issue of tax- exempt obligations described in section 103(a). Because none of the  rapid rail cars and buses are included as part of the UMTA-funded  project, no part of them is deemed to be financed by UMTA. If at least 5  percent of the cost of the qualified mass commuting vehicles is provided  by tax exempt obligations under section 103(a), the vehicles will be  qualified leased property in their entirety.</p><p class="depth0">Example (6). City Z has a mass transit agency (ZTA) which purchases  on July 1, 1982, 10 buses for which it pays $1,000,000, 95 percent of  which is derived from grants from city Z and 5 percent from tax exempt  obligations described in section 103(a). The buses have a useful life  within the meaning of Sec. 1.167(a)-1(b) of 10 years and their salvage  value is zero. On July 1, 1983, ZTA sells these buses to corporation P  and leases them back in a transaction which the parties elect to have  treated as a lease under section 168(f)(8). At the time of the sale and  leaseback, ZTA's adjusted basis in the 10 buses under section 1016(a)(3)  and Sec. 1.1016-4 is $900,000 ($1,000,000 cost less $100,000 of  depreciation sustained, computed on a stright-line basis). Before the  transaction will qualify under section 168(f)(8) and Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)- 6(b)(3)(ii), P's adjusted basis in the vehicles may not exceed ZTA's  basis, or $900,000. Assuming that the transaction qualifies under  section 168(f)(8) and that corporation P is a calendar year taxpayer, P  may claim ACRS deductions for 1982 of $135,000 (15 percent of $900,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example (7). The facts are the same as in example (6) except that  the sale and leaseback transaction is closed on December 31, 1982. P's  adjusted basis in the vehicles may not exceed ZTA's basis, or $950,000  ($1,000,000 cost less $50,000 of depreciation sustained, computed on a  straight-line basis).</p><p class="depth0">Example (8). The facts are the same as in example (6) except that  ZTA purchases the buses on June 1, 1981, and enters into the sale and  leaseback transaction with corporation P on December 31, 1981. Under  Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-6(b)(3)(ii), no adjustment is made to ZTA's basis in  the buses for depreciation sustained. Therefore, P's basis in the buses  may equal ZTA's cost of $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example (9). On July 1, 1981, a unit of city W, W Transit Authority  (WTA), purchases 100 buses with local grants derived entirely from a  city W sales tax. The buses do not constitute qualified leased property  under Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-6(b)(3) because no part of the financing for  their purchase was derived from the proceeds of tax exempt obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Example (10). The facts are the same as in example (9) except that  on November 1, 1981, WTA borrows 5 percent of the cost of the buses and  pledges them as security. The interest on WTA's obligation is excludable  from income under section 103(a)(1). On December 31, 1981, WTA sells to  T Corp. all 100 buses and leases them back. Under Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)- 6(b)(3)(i), each bus is deemed to be financed with the proceeds of tax  exempt obligations. Therefore, if the vehicles otherwise meet the  definition of qualified leased property, all the vehicles will be  qualified leased property under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign lessees. In addition to the other provisions of this  section, property which is leased under a section 168(f)(8) lease to a  foreign person shall not be qualified leased property unless the gross  income attributable to the property from all sources (determined without  regard to section 872(a) or 882(b)) is effectively connected with a  trade or business within the United States, and the taxable income, if  any, attributable to the property is subject to tax under section  871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1). For this purpose, if income attributable to the  property is not included in gross income of a foreign lessee, and is  exempt from taxation, under sections 872 or 833, or if the income is  otherwise exempt from taxation under any income tax convention to which  the United States is a party, then the property shall not be qualified  leased property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other rules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified leased property may include undivided  interests in property or property regardless of whether or not it is  considered separate property under State or local law. If property  subject to a section 168(f)(8) lease is later determined not to be  qualified leased property, disqualification of the lease under section  168(f)(8) will apply only as to that property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of this paragraph (b)(5) may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). On July 1, 1981, X Corp. contracts to have a  manufacturing facility constructed for use in its business. Construction  of the facility is completed on July 1, 1982, and the facility is deemed  to be placed in service as of that date under Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)- 6(b)(2)(i). The facility is comprised of a mixture of new section 38  property and buildings that do not qualify as section 38 property. On  August 1, 1982, X sells the new section 38 property in the facility to Y  and leases it back under an agreement in which the parties elect to be  treated as a lease described in section 168(f)(8). Assuming that the  other requirements of this paragraph are met, the new section 38  property contained in the facility will be qualified leased property. If  it is later determined that property subject to the section 168(f)(8)  lease is not new section 38 property (and thus not qualified leased  property), the safe harbor protection will be lost only as to that  property.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). X Corp. acquires a certain piece of equipment (which is  new section 38 property) for use in its business. Within 3 months, X  sells a 70 percent undivided interest in the property to lessor A and a  10 percent undivided interest in the property to lessor B and leases  both portions back under separate section 168(f)(8) leases. The  investment tax credit and ACRS deductions associated with the property  will be divided among X, lessor A, and lessor B, on a basis of 20  percent, 70 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

The fact that the lessor's payments of interest and  principal and the lessee's rental payments under the lease are not equal  in amount will not prevent the lease from qualifying under section  168(f)(8). However, see paragraph (b) for special requirements in sale  and leaseback transactions. In determining the parties' income,  deductions, and investment tax credit under the lease, the rules in  paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section shall apply regardless of the  overall method of accounting otherwise used by the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for sale and leaseback transaction. If the property  leased is financed by the lessee (or a related party of the leasee) in a  sale and leaseback transaction, the lease will not qualify under section  168(f)(8) unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term of the lessor's purchase money obligation is  coterminous with the term of the lease, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interest deductions and income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deductibility from income.

In cases in which the property is not financed by the lessee or a party  related to the lessee, the computation of the interest deduction may  take into account fluctuations in the interest rate which are dependent  on adjustments in the prime rate or events outside the control of the  lessor and the third party creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includibility in income.

The recovery class of qualified leased property in  the hands of the lessor shall be determined by the character of the  property in the hands of the owner of the property without regard to  section 168(f)(8). Any elections under section 168(b)(3) by the lessor  with respect to the class of recovery property to which the qualified  leased property is assigned shall apply to the leased property.

If in a sale and leaseback  transaction the lessor elects pursuant to section 48(d) to treat the  lessee (which is the user of the property) as having acquired the  property for purposes of claiming the investment tax credit, the lessee  shall be treated as acquiring the property for an amount equal to the  basis of the property to the lessor (and not for an amount equal to its  fair market value). The investment tax credit allowable to the lessee is  further limited to the extent the at risk rules apply to either the  lessor or to the lessee. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The application of the provisions of this section may  be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). Y, a qualified lessor, acquires a piece of equipment  which is qualified leased property for $1 million and leases it to X  under a lease which the parties properly   elect to have characterized as a lease described in section 168(f)(8).  The equipment has a 10-year economic life and falls within the 5-year  ACRS class. Under the terms of the lease, X, the lessee-user, is  obligated to pay Y nine annual payments of $10,000 and, at the end of  the lease term, Y has the option to sell the property to X for  $2,160,000. Under Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-7(d), the aggregate payments  required to be made by X under the lease are $2,250,000 ($90,000 rent  plus $2,160,000 option price) and are treated as rent to Y (less a  reasonable estimate for the residual value of the property) and taxable  as such. Assuming a reasonable estimate of the residual value is zero,  the full $2,250,000 will be treated as rent, and under Sec.  5c.168(f)(8)-7(d), such amount is deductible by X and includible in Y's  income ratably over the term of the lease, i.e., at a rate of $250,000  per year ($2,250,000 divided by 9).</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  under the terms of the lease X is obligated to make rental payments of  $100,000 for each of the first 5 years of the lease and $300,000 for  each of the 4 remaining years under the lease. Further, X has an option  to purchase the equipment for $1.00 at the end of the lease term.  Pursuant to Sec. 5c.168(f)(8)-7(d), X's aggregate rental payments are  deductible by X and are includible in Y's income ratably over the term  of the lease. Thus, the annual rental payments are deemed to be $188,000  per year ($1,700,000 divided by 9).
