The list will be  amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and  agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the  Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for  Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either  or both of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by  the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minor changes in previously approved research during the period  (of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.  Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by  the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated  by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the  research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB  except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research  activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the  non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 97.108(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a  method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have  been approved under the procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate,  or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the  expedited review procedure.
