                            <p class="depth0">When preparing f.o.b. origin solicitations, the contracting officer  shall refer to 47.303, where f.o.b. origin clauses relating to standard  delivery terms are prescribed. Supply solicitations that will or may  result in f.o.b. origin contracts shall also contain requirements,  information, provisions, and clauses concerning the following items:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delivery in carload or truckload lots f.o.b. carrier's  equipment, wharf, or freight station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirement that the offeror furnish the following  information with the offer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Location of the offeror's actual shipping point(s) (street  address, city, State, and ZIP code) from which supplies will be  delivered to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the offeror's shipping point has a private railroad  siding, and the name of the rail carrier serving it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the offeror's shipping point does not have a private  siding, the names and addresses of the nearest public rail siding and of  the carrier serving it. (This will enable transportation officers, when  issuing routing instructions, to select the mode of transportation that  will provide the required service at the lowest possible overall cost.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The quantity of supplies to be shipped from each shipping  point.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer shall insert in f.o.b. origin  solicitations the provision at 52.247-46, Shipping Point(s) Used in  Evaluation of F.o.b. Origin Offers, when price evaluation for shipments  from various shipping points is contemplated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When delivery is f.o.b. origin, contractor's facility, and the  designated facility is not covered by the line-haul transportation rate,  the charges required to deliver the shipment to the point where the  line-haul rate is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When delivery is f.o.b. origin, freight allowed, the basis on  which transportation charges will be allowed, including the origin and  destination from and to which transportation charges will be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If f.o.b. origin offers only are desired, a statement that  offers submitted on any other basis will be rejected as nonresponsive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The methods of transportation used in evaluating offers. The  Government normally uses land transportation by regulated common  carriers between points in the 48 contiguous United States and the  District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.247-47,  Evaluation--F.o.b. Origin, in solicitations that require prices f.o.b.  origin for the purpose of establishing the basis on which offers will be  evaluated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When it is believed that prospective contractors are likely  to include in f.o.b. origin offers a contingency to compensate for what  may be an unfavorable routing condition by the Government at the time of  shipment, the contracting officer may permit prospective contractors to  state in offers a reimbursable differential that represents the cost of  bringing the supplies to any f.o.b. origin place of delivery specified  by the Government at the time of shipment (see the clause at 52.247-33,  F.o.b. Origin, with Differentials).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following are situations that might impose on the contractor a  substantial cost above at plant or commercial shipping point prices  because of Government-required routings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The loading nature of the supplies; e.g., wheeled vehicles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The different methods of shipment specified by the Government;  e.g., towaway, driveaway, tri-level vehicle, or rail car, that may  increase the contractor's cost in varying amounts for bringing the  supplies to, or loading and bracing the supplies at, the specified place  of delivery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contractor's f.o.b. origin shipping point is a port city  served by United States inland, coastwise, or intercoastal water  transportation, and the contractor would incur additional costs to make  delivery f.o.b. a wharf in that city to accommodate water routing  specified by the Government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The contractor's plant does not have a private rail siding and  in order to ship by Government-specified rail routing, the contractor  would be required to deliver the supplies to a public siding or freight  terminal and to load, brace, and install dunnage in rail cars.
