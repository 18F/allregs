                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 909.507-2, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Organizational Conflicts of Interest (AUG 2009)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the  Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual,  organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this  contract, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over  other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to  performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates  or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as  ``Contractor'') in the activities covered by this clause as a prime  Contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in  any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs  when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control  another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of contractor's work product. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor shall be  ineligible to participate in any capacity in Department contracts,  subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which  stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this  contract for a period of (Contracting Officer see 48 CFR 909.507-2 and  enter specific term) years after the completion of this contract.  Furthermore, unless so   directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not  perform any advisory and assistance services work under this contract on  any of its products or services or the products or services of another  firm if the Contractor is or has been substantially involved in their  development or marketing. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude  the Contractor from competing for follow-on contracts for advisory and  assistance services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, under this contract, the Contractor prepares a complete or  essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in  competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform  or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based  on such statement of work or specifications. The Contractor shall not  incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or  specifications unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer,  in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Contractor from  offering or selling its standard and commercial items to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Access to and use of information. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Contractor, in the  performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as  Department plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal  data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or data which  has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the  Contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting  Officer it shall not--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> use such information for any private purpose unless the  information has been released or otherwise made available to the public;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> compete for work for the Department based on such information  for a period of six (6) months after either the completion of this  contract or until such information is released or otherwise made  available to the public, whichever is first;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based  on such information until one year after such information is released or  otherwise made available to the public; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> release such information unless such information has previously  been released or otherwise made available to the public by the  Department.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition, the Contractor agrees that to the extent it  receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the  Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged  technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it  shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions imposed  on such information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Contractor may use technical data it first produces under  this contract for its private purposes consistent with paragraphs  (b)(2)(i) (A) and (D) of this clause and the patent, rights in data, and  security provisions of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure after award. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor agrees that, if  changes, including additions, to the facts disclosed by it prior to  award of this contract, occur during the performance of this contract,  it shall make an immediate and full disclosure of such changes in  writing to the Contracting Officer. Such disclosure may include a  description of any action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to  take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of  interest. The Department may, however, terminate the contract for  convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of  the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that the Contractor was aware of facts required to  be disclosed or the existence of an actual or potential organizational  conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of  interest to the Contracting Officer, DOE may terminate this contract for  default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions or for  nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts required to be disclosed  concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or  potential organizational conflict of interest at the time of or after  award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify  the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue  such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver. Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed  in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a full  description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.  If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the  Contracting Officer may grant such a waiver in writing.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth2">Alterate I: In accordance with 909.507-2 and 970.0905, include the  following alternate in the specified types of contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subcontracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall include a clause,  substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), in  subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold  determined in accordance with 48 CFR part 13 and involving the  performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined  at 48 CFR 2.101. The terms ``contract,'' ``Contractor,'' and  ``contracting officer'' shall be appropriately modified to preserve the  Government's rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts  for advisory and assistance services, the Contractor shall obtain from  the proposed subcontractor or consultant the disclosure required by 48  CFR 909.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests  disclosed present an actual or significant potential for an  organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant  potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the  Contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the  organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the Contractor. If the  conflict cannot be avoided or neutralized, the Contractor must obtain  the approval of the DOE Contracting Officer prior to entering into the  subcontract.</p><p class="depth3">(End of alternate)  [62 FR 40752, July 30, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 36368, 36378, 36380,  July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7694, Feb. 11, 2011]</p>
