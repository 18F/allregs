Minor Program liens may be released when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debt is paid in full;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Security property is sold for market value and sale proceeds are received and applied to the borrower's creditors according to lien priority; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An exchange in accordance with Sec. 772.8 has been concluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Borrower liability. The Agency may release a borrower from liability when the Minor Program loan, plus all administrative collection costs and charges are paid in full. IMP borrowers who have had previous debt forgiveness on a farm loan program loan as defined in 7 CFR part 761, however, cannot be released from liability by FSA until the previous loss to the Agency has been repaid with interest from the date of debt forgiveness. An AMP borrower may also be released in accordance with Sec. 772.10 in conjunction with a transfer and assumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Servicing of debt not satisfied through liquidation. Balances remaining after sale or liquidation of the security will be subject to administrative offset in accordance with 7 CFR part 3, Department of Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Treasury Cross-Servicing regulations at 31 CFR part 285 and Federal Claims Collections Standards at 31 CFR parts 900-904. Thereafter the debt settlement provisions in 7 CFR part 1956, subpart B of chapter XVIII of the Code of Federal Regulations or successor regulation apply.
