                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce more than 4 hours before the scheduled departure time of the primary conveyance on which the animal is to be transported. However, a carrier or intermediate handler may agree with anyone consigning a dog or cat to extend this time by up to 2 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce unless they are provided with the name, address, and telephone number of the consignee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce unless the consignor certifies in writing to the carrier or intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier or intermediate handler. The certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner that makes it easily noticed and read. Instructions for no food or water are not acceptable unless directed by the attending veterinarian. Instructions must be in compliance with Sec. 3.16 of this subpart. The certification must include the following information for each dog and cat:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consignor's name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tag number or tattoo assigned to each dog or cat under Sec. Sec. 2.38 and 2.50 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for a 24-hour period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The consignor's signature and the date and time the certification was signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce in a primary enclosure unless the primary enclosure meets the requirements of Sec. 3.14 of this subpart. A carrier or intermediate handler must not accept a dog or cat for transport if the primary enclosure is obviously defective or damaged and cannot reasonably be expected to safely and comfortably contain the dog or cat without causing suffering or injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce unless their animal holding area meets the minimum temperature requirements provided in Sec. Sec. 3.18 and 3.19 of this subpart, or unless the consignor provides them with a certificate signed by a veterinarian and dated no more than 10 days before delivery of the animal to the carrier or intermediate handler for transport in commerce, certifying that the animal is acclimated to temperatures lower than those required in Sec. Sec. 3.18 and 3.19 of this subpart. Even if the carrier or intermediate handler receives this certification, the temperatures the dog or cat is exposed to while in a terminal facility must not be lower than 45 [deg]F (2.2 [deg]C) for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs or cats are present, as set forth in Sec. 3.18, nor lower than 45 [deg]F (2.2 [deg]C) for more than 45 minutes, as set forth in Sec. 3.19, when moving dogs or cats to or from terminal facilities or primary conveyances. A copy of the certification must accompany the dog or cat to its destination and must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consignor's name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tag number or tattoo assigned to each dog or cat under Sec. Sec. 2.38 and 2.50 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement by a veterinarian, dated no more than 10 days before delivery, that to the best of his or her knowledge, each of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosure is acclimated to air temperatures lower than 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C); but not lower than a minimum temperature, specified on a certificate, that the attending veterinarian has determined is based on generally accepted temperature standards for the age, condition, and breed of the dog or cat; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The signature of the veterinarian and the date the certification was signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a primary enclosure containing a dog or cat has arrived at the

animal holding area at a terminal facility after transport, the carrier or intermediate handler must attempt to notify the consignee upon arrival and at least once in every 6-hour period thereafter. The time, date, and method of all attempted notifications and the actual notification of the consignee, and the name of the person who notifies or attempts to notify the consignee must be written either on the carrier's or intermediate handler's copy of the shipping document or on the copy that accompanies the primary enclosure. If the consignee cannot be notified within 24 hours after the dog or cat has arrived at the terminal facility, the carrier or intermediate handler must return the animal to the consignor or to whomever the consignor designates. If the consignee is notified of the arrival and does not accept delivery of the dog or cat within 48 hours after arrival of the dog or cat, the carrier or intermediate handler must return the animal to the consignor or to whomever the consignor designates. The carrier or intermediate handler must continue to provide proper care, feeding, and housing to the dog or cat, and maintain the dog or cat in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices until the consignee accepts delivery of the dog or cat or until it is returned to the consignor or to whomever the consignor designates. The carrier or intermediate handler must obligate the consignor to reimburse the carrier or intermediate handler for the cost of return transportation and care.
