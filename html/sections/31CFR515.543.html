                            <p class="depth0">Specific licenses for importation of goods of Cuban origin are  generally not issued unless the applicant submits satisfactory  documentary proof of the location of the goods outside Cuba prior to  July 8, 1963 and of the absence of any Cuban interest in the goods at  all times on or since that date. Since the type of document which would  constitute satisfactory proof varies depending upon the facts of the  particular case, it is not possible to state in advance the type of  documents required. However, it has been found that affidavits,  statements, invoices, and other documents prepared by manufacturers,  processors, sellers or shippers cannot be relied on and are therefore  not by themselves accepted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as  satisfactory proof of origin. Independent corroborating documentary  evidence, such as insurance documents, bills of lading, etc., may be  accepted as satisfactory proof.  [39 FR 25317, July 10, 1974]</p>
