                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within the limits of funds available for that purpose, the Secretary will award a grant to those applicants whose approved projects will in the Secretary's judgment best promote the purposes of the statute authorizing the grant and the regulations of this part. The date specified by the Secretary as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than 9 months following the date of any initial or new award statement unless the Secretary finds that because of the nature of a project or the grantee's particular circumstances earlier assurance of grant support is required to initiate the project. Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award and the applicable cost principles prescribed in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of unapproved drug treatments for AIDS. Grants under section 2314 of the Act to support research relating to the evaluation of drug treatments for AIDS not approved by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall be subject to appropriate scientific and ethical guidelines established by the Secretary for each project, pursuant to section 2314(c) of the Act. In order to receive a grant, the applicant must agree to comply with those guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of grant award. (1) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit an application at the time and in the form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe to have support continued for each subsequent year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiple or concurrent awards. Whenever a research project involves a number of different but related problems, activities or disciplines which require evaluation by different groups, or whenever support for a project could be more effectively administered by separate handling of separate aspects of the project, the Secretary may evaluate, approve, and make one or more awards pursuant to one or more applications. When making more than one award in response to a single application, the Secretary shall consult with the applicant organization(s), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unobligated balances. The Secretary may permit unobligated grant funds remaining in the grant account at the close of a budget period to be carried forward for obligation during a subsequent budget period, provided a continuation award is made for that period and the Secretary's written approval is obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Award for continuation of project under new grantee. The Secretary, upon application in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  52.4 and without further action by a Council or other body, may make a grant to any institution or other person eligible under Sec.  52.3 for continuation of a currently supported project for which a grant was previously made to another institution or person, provided the Secretary finds that the change in the conduct of the project is consonant with the previous

evaluation and approval of the project under Sec.  52.5.
