                                Sec. 0.451  Inspection of records: Generally.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Records which are routinely available for public inspection.  Sections 0.453 and 0.455 list those Commission records which are  routinely available for public inspection and the places at which those  records may be inspected. Procedures governing requests for inspection  of such records are set out in Sec. 0.460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records which are not routinely available for public inspection.  Records which are not listed in Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 0.455 are not  routinely available for public inspection. Such records fall into two  categories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first category consists of those records or kinds of records  listed in Sec. 0.457 and of particular records withheld from public  inspection under   Sec. 0.459. The Commission has determined that there is a statutory  basis for withholding these records from public inspection. In some  cases, the Commission is prohibited from permitting the inspection of  records. In other cases, the records are the property of another agency,  and the Commission has no authority to permit their inspection. In still  other cases, the Commission is authorized, for reason of policy, to  withhold records from inspection, but is not required to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The second category consists of records that are not listed in  Sec. 0.453, Sec. 0.455, or Sec. 0.457 and have not been withheld from  inspection under Sec. 0.459. In some cases, these records have not been  identified for listing. In other cases (e.g., the general correspondence  files), the Commission is unable to determine either that all records in  a class should be routinely available for inspection or that all records  in that class should not be routinely available for inspection, and  individualized determination is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures governing requests for inspection of these records  are set forth in Sec. 0.461.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedures governing demands by competent authority for  inspection of these records are set forth in Sec. 0.463.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 0.461 and Sec. 0.463, or pursuant to  Sec. 19.735-203 of this chapter, no officer or employee of the  Commission shall permit the inspection of records which are not  routinely available for public inspection under Sec. 0.453 or  Sec. 0.455, or disclose information contained therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> apply to  requests for certified copies of Commission records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Search and copying fees. Section 0.465(c)(2) prescribes the per  page fee for copying records made available for inspection under  Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. Section 0.466 prescribes fees to cover the  expense of searching for and reviewing records made available for  inspection under Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. Review of initial fee  determinations under Sec. 0.467 through Sec. 0.470 and initial fee  reduction or waiver determinations under Sec. 0.470(e) may be sought  under Sec. 0.461(j).</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth2">The Commission may require advance payment pursuant to Sec. 0.469  before releasing documents.</p>
