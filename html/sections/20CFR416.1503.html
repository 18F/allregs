For purposes of calculating fees for representation, we first determine the SSI past-due benefits before any applicable reduction for reimbursement to a State (or political subdivision) for interim assistance reimbursement, and before any applicable reduction under section 1127 of the Act (for receipt of benefits for the same period under title II). We then reduce that figure by the amount of any reduction of title II or title XVI benefits that was required by section 1127. We do this whether the actual offset, as provided under section 1127, reduced the title II or title XVI benefits. Past-due benefits do not include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Continued benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 416.996 of this part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Continued benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 416.1336(b) of this part; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Interim benefits paid pursuant to section 1631(a)(8) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Representational services means services performed for a claimant in connection with any claim the claimant has before us, any asserted right the claimant may have for an initial or reconsidered determination, and any decision or action by an administrative law judge or the Appeals Council.</p><p class="depth2">Representative means an attorney who meets all of the requirements of Sec. 416.1505(a), or a person other than an attorney who meets all of the requirements of Sec. 416.1505(b), and whom you appoint to represent you in dealings with us.</p><p class="depth2">We, our, or us refers to the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p><p class="depth2">You or your refers to any person or the eligible spouse of any person claiming or receiving supplemental security income benefits.
