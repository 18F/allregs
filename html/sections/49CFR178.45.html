                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Type, size, and service pressure. A DOT 3T cylinder is a  seamless steel cylinder with a minimum water capacity of 1,000 pounds  and a minimum service pressure of 1,800 psig. Each cylinder must have  integrally formed heads concave to pressure at both ends. The inside  head shape must be hemispherical, ellipsoidal in which the major axis is  two times the minor axis, or a dished shape falling within these two  limits. Permanent closures formed by spinning are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Material, steel. Only open hearth, basic oxygen, or electric  furnace process steel of uniform quality is authorized. The steel  analysis must conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2">Analysis Tolerances ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Check Analysis</p><p class="depth2">Element                  Ladle analysis   -----------------</p><p class="depth2">Under     Over ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Carbon...........................  0.35 to 0.50.......     0.03     0.04 Manganese........................  0.75 to 1.05.......     0.04     0.04 Phosphorus (max).................  0.035..............  .......     0.01 Sulphur (max)....................  0.04...............  .......     0.01 Silicon..........................  0.15 to 0.35.......     0.02     0.03 Chromium.........................  0.80 to 1.15.......     0.05     0.05 Molybdenum.......................  0.15 to 0.25.......     0.02     0.02 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A heat of steel made under the specifications in the table in  this paragraph (b), the ladle analysis of which is slightly out of the  specified range, is acceptable if satisfactory in all other aspects.  However, the check analysis tolerances shown in the table in this  paragraph (b) may not be exceeded except as approved by the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Material with seams, cracks, laminations, or other injurious  defects is not permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Material used must be identified by any suitable method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacture. General manufacturing requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface finish must be uniform and reasonably smooth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inside surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of loose particles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No defect of any kind is permitted if it is likely to weaken a  finished cylinder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the cylinder surface is not originally free from the defects,  the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these  defects provided the minimum wall thickness is maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Welding or brazing on a cylinder is not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the  wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure does not exceed 67  percent of the minimum tensile strength of the   steel as determined by the physical tests required in paragraphs (j) and  (k) of this section. A wall stress of more than 90,500 p.s.i. is not  permitted. The minimum wall thickness for any cylinder may not be less  than 0.225 inch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculation of the stress for cylinders must be made by the  following formula:  S = [P(1.3D\2\ + 0.4d\2\)] / (D\2\ - d\2\)  Where:  S = Wall stress in psi; P = Minimum test pressure, at least \5/3\ service pressure; D = Outside diameter in inches; d = Inside diameter in inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each cylinder must meet the following additional requirement  which assumes a cylinder horizontally supported at its two ends and  uniformly loaded over its entire length. This load consists of the  weight per inch of length of the straight cylindrical portion filled  with water compressed to the specified test pressure. The wall thickness  must be increased when necessary to meet this additional requirement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sum of two times the maximum tensile stress in the bottom  fibers due to bending (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section), plus  the maximum tensile stress in the same fibers due to hydrostatic testing  (see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section) may not exceed 80 percent of  the minimum yield strength of the steel at this maximum stress.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum  tensile stress due to bending:  S = Mc / I  Where:  S = Tensile stress in psi; M = Bending moment in inch-pounds (wl\2\/8); I = Moment of inertia--0.04909 (D\4\-d\4\) in inches fourth; c = Radius (D/2) of cylinder in inches; w = Weight per inch of cylinder filled with water; l = Length of cylinder in inches; D = Outside diameter in inches; d = Inside diameter in inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum  longitudinal tensile stress due to hydrostatic test pressure:  S = A1 P / A2  Where:  S = Tensile stress in psi; A1 = Internal area in cross section of cylinder in square</p><p class="depth4">inches; P = Hydrostatic test pressure-psig; A2 = Area of metal in cross section of cylinder in square</p><p class="depth4">inches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Heat treatment. Each completed cylinder must be uniformly and  properly heat treated prior to testing, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each cylinder must be heated and held at the proper temperature  for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum  thickness of the cylinder and then quenched in a suitable liquid medium  having a cooling rate not in excess of 80 percent of water. The steel  temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel  analysis, but it must never exceed 1750 F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After quenching, each cylinder must be reheated to a temperature  below the transformation range but not less than 1050 F., and must be  held at this temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness  based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder. Each cylinder must then  be cooled under conditions recommended for the steel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Openings. Openings in cylinders must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Openings are permitted on heads only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The size of any centered opening in a head may not exceed one  half the outside diameter of the cylinder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Openings in a head must have ligaments between openings of at  least three times the average of their hole diameter. No off-center  opening may exceed 2.625 inches in diameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All openings must be circular.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All openings must be threaded. Threads must be in compliance  with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each thread must be clean cut, even, without any checks, and to  gauge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Taper threads, when used, must be the American Standard Pipe  thread (NPT) type and must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS  Handbook H-28 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Taper threads conforming to National Gas Taper thread (NGT)  standards must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H- 28.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Straight threads conforming with National Gas Straight thread  (NGS) standards are authorized. These threads must be in compliance with  the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must be tested at an internal  pressure by the water jacket method or other suitable method, conforming  to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The testing apparatus must be operated in a manner that will  obtain accurate data. Any pressure gauge used must permit reading to an  accuracy of one percent. Any expansion gauge used must permit reading of  the total expansion to an accuracy of one percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any internal pressure applied to the cylinder after heat  treatment and before the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the  test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pressure must be maintained sufficiently long to assure  complete expansion of the cylinder. In no case may the pressure be held  less than 30 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the required test  pressure cannot be maintained, the test must be repeated at a pressure  increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is lower or, the cylinder  must be reheat treated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Permanent volumetric expansion of the cylinder may not exceed 10  percent of its total volumetric expansion at the required test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each cylinder must be tested to at least \5/3\ times its service  pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Ultrasonic examination. After the hydrostatic test, the  cylindrical section of each vessel must be examined in accordance with  ASTM E 213 for shear wave and E 114 for straight beam (IBR, Standard see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). The equipment used must be calibrated to  detect a notch equal to five percent of the design minimum wall  thickness. Any discontinuity indication greater than that produced by  the five percent notch must be cause for rejection of the cylinder,  unless the discontinuity is repaired within the requirements of this  specification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Basic requirements for tension and Charpy impact tests.  Cylinders must be subjected to a tension and Charpy impact as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the cylinders are heat treated in a batch furnace, two  tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from  one of the cylinders or a test ring from each batch. The lot size  represented by these tests may not exceed 200 cylinders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the cylinders are heat treated in a continuous furnace, two  tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from  one of the cylinders or a test ring from each four hours or less of  production. However, in no case may a test lot based on this production  period exceed 200 cylinders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each specimen for the tension and Charpy impact tests must be  taken from the side wall of a cylinder or from a ring which has been  heat treated with the finished cylinders of which the specimens must be  representative. The axis of the specimens must be parallel to the axis  of the cylinder. Each cylinder or ring specimen for test must be of the  same diameter, thickness, and metal as the finished cylinders they  represent. A test ring must be at least 24 inches long with ends covered  during the heat treatment process so as to simulate the heat treatment  process of the finished cylinders it represents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A test cylinder or test ring need represent only one of the  heats in a furnace batch provided the other heats in the batch have  previously been tested and have passed the tests and that such tests do  not represent more than 200 cylinders from any one heat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The test results must conform to the requirements specified in  paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the test results do not conform to the requirements  specified, the cylinders represented by the tests may be reheat treated  and the tests repeated. Paragraph (i)(5) of this section applies to any  retesting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Basic conditions for acceptable physical testing. The following  criteria must be followed to obtain acceptable physical test results:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each tension specimen must have a gauge length of two inches  with a width not exceeding one and one-half inches. Except for the grip  ends, the specimen may not be flattened. The   grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A specimen may not be heated after heat treatment specified in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding  to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gage length.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This yield strength must be determined by the ``offset'' method  or the ``extension under load'' method described in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain (or  extension under load) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2  percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient  accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gage length under  appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gage length.  Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of  30,000,000. However, when the degree of accuracy of this method is  questionable the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the  yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must  be set with the specimen under a stress of 12,000 p.s.i. and the strain  indicator reading set at the calculated corresponding strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed \1/ 8\ inch per minute during the determination of yield strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each impact specimen must be Charpy V-notch type size 10 mm x 10  mm taken in accordance with paragraph 11 of ASTM A 333 (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). When a reduced size specimen is used, it  must be the largest size obtainable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Acceptable physical test results. Results of physical tests must  conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tensile strength may not exceed 155,000 p.s.i.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The elongation must be at least 16 percent for a two-inch gage  length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Charpy V-notch impact properties for the three impact  specimens which must be tested at 0 F may not be less than the values  shown as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Average value for    Minimum value (1</p><p class="depth3">Size of specimen (mm)          acceptance (3      specimen only of</p><p class="depth3">specimens)             the 3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10.0 x 10.0....................  25.0 ft. lbs......  20.0 ft. lbs. 10.0 x 7.5.....................  21.0 ft. lbs......  17.0 ft. lbs. 10.0 x 5.0.....................  17.0 ft. lbs......  14.0 ft. lbs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the final heat treatment, each vessel must be hardness  tested on the cylindrical section. The tensile strength equivalent of  the hardness number obtained may not be more than 165,000 p.s.i. (Rc  36). When the result of a hardness test exceeds the maximum permitted,  two or more retests may be made; however, the hardness number obtained  in each retest may not exceed the maximum permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected  cylinders. However, each reheat treated cylinder must subsequently pass  all the prescribed tests. Repair by welding is not authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Markings. Marking must be done by stamping into the metal of the  cylinder. All markings must be legible and located on a shoulder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Inspector's report. In addition to the requirements of  Sec. 178.35, the inspector's report for the physical test report, must  indicate the average value for three specimens and the minimum value for  one specimen for each lot number.
