The owner or operator of a vessel that is required to obtain a Federal fisheries or processor permit under Sec. 679.4 must comply with the IR/IU program set out in this section while fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI, fishing for groundfish in waters of the State of Alaska that are shoreward of the GOA or BSAI, or when processing groundfish harvested in the GOA or BSAI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> IR/IU species.
