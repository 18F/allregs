Such requests include a request seeking approval under, modification of, or termination of an order issued under part 108 or 109 of this chapter, a supervisory agreement, a supervisory directive, a consent merger agreement or a document negotiated in settlement of an enforcement matter or other litigation, unless an applicable OCC regulation specifically requires an application under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An application filed under an OCC regulation that prescribes other application processing procedures and time frames for the approval of applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an OCC regulation for a specific type of application prescribes some application processing procedures, or time frames, the OCC will apply this part to the extent necessary to process the application. For example, if an OCC regulation for a specific type of application does not identify time periods for the processing of an application, the time periods in this part apply.</p>
