                            <p class="depth0">Whenever the nature of the injury is such that immediate medical  care is required and the injured employee is unable to select a  physician, the employer shall select a physician. Thereafter the  employee may change physicians when he is able to make a selection. Such  changes shall be made upon obtaining written authorization from the  employer or, if consent is withheld, from the district director. The  Director will direct reimbursement of medical claims for services  rendered by physicians or health care providers who are on the list of  those excluded from providing care under the Act, if such services were  rendered in an emergency. (See Sec. Sec. 702.417 and 702.435(b)).  [38 FR 26861, Sept. 26, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 402, Jan. 3, 1985]</p>
