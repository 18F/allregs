                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible governmental plans. A plan of a State ceases to be an  eligible governmental plan on the first day of the first plan year  beginning more than 180 days after the date on which the Commissioner  notifies the State in writing that the plan is being administered in a  manner that is inconsistent with one or more of the requirements of  Secs. 1.457-3 through 1.457-8 or 1.447-10. However, the plan may correct  the plan inconsistencies specified in the written notification before  the first day of that plan year and continue to maintain plan  eligibility. If a plan ceases to be an eligible governmental plan,  amounts subsequently deferred by participants will be includible in  income when deferred, or, if later, when the amounts deferred cease to  be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, as provided at  Sec. 1.457-11. Amounts deferred before the date on which the plan ceases  to be an eligible governmental plan, and any earnings thereon, will be  treated as if the plan continues to be an eligible governmental plan and  will not be includible in participant's or beneficiary's gross income  until paid to the participant or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible plans of tax-exempt entities. A plan of a tax-exempt  entity ceases to be an eligible plan on the first day that the plan  fails to satisfy one or more of the requirements of Secs. 1.457-3  through 1.457-8, or Sec. 1.457-10. See Sec. 1.457-11 for rules regarding  the treatment of an ineligible plan.  [T.D. 9075, 68 FR 41240, July 11, 2003; 68 FR 51447, Aug. 27, 2003]</p>
