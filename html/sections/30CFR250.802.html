                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All production facilities, including separators, treaters, compressors, headers, and flowlines shall be designed, installed, and maintained in a manner which provides for efficiency, safety of operation, and protection of the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Platforms. You must protect all platform production facilities with a basic and ancillary surface safety system designed, analyzed, installed, tested, and maintained in operating condition in accordance with API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). If you use processing components other than those for which Safety Analysis Checklists are included in API RP 14C you must utilize the analysis technique and documentation specified therein to determine the effects and requirements of these components on the safety system. Safety device requirements for pipelines are under Sec.  250.1004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specification for surface safety valves (SSV) and underwater safety valves (USV). All wellhead SSVs, USVs, and their actuators which are installed in the OCS shall conform to the requirements in Sec.  250.806 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of SSVs and USV's. All SSVs and USVs must be inspected, installed, maintained, and tested in accordance with API RP 14H, Recommended Practice for Installation, Maintenance, and Repair of Surface Safety Valves and Underwater Safety Valves Offshore (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). If any SSV or USV does not operate properly or if any fluid flow is observed during the leakage test, the valve shall be repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval of safety-systems design and installation features. Prior to installation, the lessee shall submit, in duplicate for approval to the District Manager a production safety system application containing information relative to design and installation features. Information concerning approved design and installation features shall be maintained by the lessee at the lessee's offshore field office nearest the OCS facility or other location conveniently available to the District Manager. All approvals are subject to field verifications. The application shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A schematic flow diagram showing tubing pressure, size, capacity, design working pressure of separators, flare scrubbers, treaters, storage tanks, compressors, pipeline pumps, metering devices, and other hydrocarbon-handling vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A schematic piping flow diagram (API RP 14C, Figure E, as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198) and the related Safety analysis Function Evaluation chart (API RP 14C, subsection 4.3c, as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A schematic piping diagram showing the size and maximum allowable working pressures as determined in accordance with API RP 14E, Design and Installation of Offshore Production Platform Piping Systems (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electrical system information including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A plan for each platform deck outlining all hazardous areas classified according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2, or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198), and outlining areas in which potential ignition sources, other than electrical, are to be installed. The area outlined will include the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All major production equipment, wells, and other significant hydrocarbon sources and a description of the type of decking, ceiling, walls (e.g., grating or solid) and firewalls; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Location of generators, control rooms, panel boards, major cabling/conduit routes, and identification of the primary wiring method (e.g., type cable, conduit, or wire).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Elementary electrical schematic of any platform safety shut-down system with a functional legend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Certification that the design for the mechanical and electrical systems to be installed were approved by registered professional engineers. After these systems are installed, the lessee shall submit a statement to the District Manager certifying that new installations conform to the approved designs of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The design and schematics of the installation and maintenance of all fire- and gas-detection systems shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Type, location, and number of detection sensors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Type and kind of alarms, including emergency equipment to be activated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Method used for detection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method and frequency of calibration; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A functional block diagram of the detection system, including the electric power supply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The service fee listed in Sec.  250.125. The fee you must pay will be determined by the number of components involved in the review and approval process.</p>
