                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart applies to you if you import into the United States  engines or equipment subject to EPA emission standards or equipment  containing engines subject to EPA emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In general, engines/equipment that you import must be covered by  a certificate of conformity unless they were built before emission  standards started to apply. This subpart describes the limited cases  where we allow importation of exempt or excluded engines/equipment. For  equipment not subject to equipment-based exhaust emission standards, an  exemption of the engine allows you to import the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. Customs and Border Protection may prevent you from  importing engines or equipment if you do not meet the requirements of  this subpart. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection  regulations may contain other requirements for engines/equipment  imported into the United States (see 19 CFR Chapter I).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Complete the appropriate EPA declaration form before importing  any engines or equipment. These forms are available on the Internet at  http://www.epa.gov/OTAQ/imports/ or by phone at 734-214-4100. Importers  must keep the forms for five years and make them available promptly upon  request.</p>
