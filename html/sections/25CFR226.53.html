                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon termination of a lease, permanent improvements, unless otherwise provided by written agreement with the surface owner and filed with the Superintendent, remain a part of said land and become the property of the surface owner upon termination of the lease. This rule does not apply to personal property, including but not limited to, tools, tanks, pipelines, pumping and drilling equipment, derricks, engines, machinery, tubing, and the casings of all wells. When any lease terminates, all such personal property must be removed within 90 calendar days or such reasonable extension of time as may be granted by the Superintendent. Otherwise, the ownership of all casings reverts to the lessor and all other personal property and permanent improvements to the surface owner. This should not be construed to relieve the lessee of responsibility for removing any such personal property or permanent improvements from the premises if required by the Superintendent and restoring the premises as nearly as practicable to the original state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon termination of lease for cause. When there has been a termination for cause, the lessor is entitled and authorized to take immediate possession of the lease premises and all permanent improvements and all other equipment necessary for the operation of the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wells to be abandoned must be promptly plugged as prescribed in writing by the Superintendent. Applications to plug must include a statement affirming compliance with Sec. 226.52 and must set forth reasons for plugging, a detailed statement of the proposed work, including the kind, location, and length of plugs (by depth), plans for mudding and cementing, testing, parting and removing casing, and any other pertinent information. The lessee must submit a written application for authority to plug a well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The lessee must plug and fill all dry or abandoned wells in a manner to confine the fluid in each formation bearing fresh water, oil, gas, salt water, and other minerals, and to protect it against invasion of fluids from other sources. Mud-laden fluid, cement, and other plugs must be used to fill the hole from bottom to top.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a satisfactory agreement is reached between the lessee and the surface owner, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, the lessee may condition the well for use as a fresh water well and must so indicate on the plugging record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manner in which plugging material will be introduced and the type of material used is subject to the approval of the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 10 calendar days after plugging, the lessee must file with the Superintendent a complete report of the plugging of each well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When any well is plugged and abandoned, the lessee must, within 90 calendar days, clean up the premises around such well to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.</p>
