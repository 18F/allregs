                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disqualification from participating in a particular matter or  category of matters is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or  actual conflicts of interest when the interest or activity giving rise  to the problem:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular,  identifiable duties of the employee involved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not so substantial as to affect or give the appearance of  affecting the integrity of the services which the Government may expect  of the employee. Whenever disqualification is employed to resolve an  apparent or actual conflict of interest, the disqualified employee shall  sign a written statement reflecting the scope of the disqualification  and the precise nature of the conflicting interest or activity. The  reviewing official shall keep a file of all such disqualification  statements and shall monitor compliance with these statements on a  regular basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of assignment is an appropriate method for resolving  apparent or actual conflicts of interest when the interest giving rise  to the problem bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular,  identifiable duties of the employee involved, and those duties  constitute a significant portion of the employee's position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) is an appropriate method for  resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee seeking the waiver reported the financial interest  that bears some relationship to his or her official duties, and the  reviewing official, in consultation with a deputy ethics counselor or  the Department Ethics Counselor, determines that the financial interest  is not so substantial as to   be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the  Government may expect from such employee; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By general rule or regulation published in the Federal Register,  the Department has exempted the financial interest from the requirements  of 18 U.S.C. 208 and this part as being too remote or too  inconsequential to affect the integrity of the Government officers'  service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A trust containing a financial interest which may give rise to  an apparent or actual conflict of interest is an appropriate method of  resolving such conflicts when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The trust is qualified under section 202(f) of the Ethics in  Government Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-521), as amended, and subject to the  regulations of the Office of Government Ethics; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the opinion of the Department's Ethics Counselor, it is  sufficiently independent of the employee involved so that the integrity  of the employee's services to the Government are not compromised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Divestiture is an appropriate method for resolving actual  conflicts of interest when the nature of the financial interest is such  that the conflict of interest cannot be adequately resolved by any of  the methods set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Terminating an appointment as a method for resolving an actual  conflict of interest should be used only when it is clear that no other  remedy can be found which would be acceptable to both the Department and  the employee. Generally, this method will be employed only in the most  extreme cases. Such a termination would be subject to adverse action.</p>
