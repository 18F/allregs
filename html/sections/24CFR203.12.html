                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to an application for  insurance of a mortgage on a one-to four-family dwelling, unless the  mortgage will be secured by a dwelling that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was completed more than one year before the date of the  application for insurance or, under the Direct Endorsement Program, was  completed more than one year before the date of the appraisal; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is being sold to a second or subsequent purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications for insurance to which this section  applies will be processed in accordance with procedures prescribed by  the Secretary. These procedures may only provide for endorsement for  insurance of a mortgage covering a dwelling that is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Approved under the Direct Endorsement Program or the Lender  Insurance Program; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Located in a subdivision approved by the Rural Housing Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mortgagee must submit a signed Builder's Certification of  Plans, Specifications and Site (Builder's Certification). The Builder's  Certification must be in a form prescribed by the Secretary and must  cover:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flood hazards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Noise;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Explosive and flammable materials storage hazards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Runway clear zones/clear zones;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Toxic waste hazards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other foreseeable hazards or adverse conditions (i.e., rock  formations, unstable soils or slopes, high ground water levels,  inadequate surface drainage, springs, etc.) that may affect the health  and safety of the occupants or the structural soundness of the  improvements. The Builder's Certification must be provided to the  appraiser for reference before the performance of an appraisal on the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a builder (or developer) intends to sell five or more  properties in a subdivision, an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan  (AFHMP) that meets the requirements of 24 CFR part 200, subpart M must  be submitted and approved by HUD no later than the date of the first  application for mortgage insurance in that subdivision. Thereafter,  applications for insurance on other properties sold by the same builder  (or developer) in the same subdivision may make reference to the  existing previously approved AFHMP.
