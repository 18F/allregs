                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, 1639b.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. This part implements the S.A.F.E. Act's Federal  registration requirement for mortgage loan originators. The S.A.F.E. Act  provides that the objectives of this registration include aggregating  and improving the flow of information to and between regulators;  providing increased accountability and tracking of mortgage loan  originators; enhancing consumer protections; supporting anti-fraud  measures; and providing consumers with easily accessible information at  no charge regarding the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated  disciplinary and enforcement actions against, mortgage loan originators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This part applies to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> National banks, Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks,  their operating subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this part as  national banks), and their employees who act as mortgage loan  originators;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Member banks of the Federal Reserve System; their respective  subsidiaries that are not functionally regulated within the meaning of  section 5(c)(5) of the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (12 U.S.C.  1844(c)(5)); branches and agencies of foreign banks; commercial lending  companies owned or controlled by foreign banks (collectively referred to  in this part as member banks); and their employees who act as mortgage  loan originators;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Insured state nonmember banks (including state-licensed  insured   branches of foreign banks), their subsidiaries (except brokers, dealers,  persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment  advisers) (collectively referred to in this part as insured state  nonmember banks), and employees of such banks or subsidiaries who act as  mortgage loan originators;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Savings associations, their operating subsidiaries  (collectively referred to in this part as savings associations), and  their employees who act as mortgage loan originators;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Farm Credit System lending institutions that actually originate  residential mortgage loans pursuant to sections 1.9(3), 1.11 or 2.4(a)  and (b) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (collectively referred to in this  part as Farm Credit System institutions), and their employees who act as  mortgage loan originators; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any federally insured credit union and its employees, including  volunteers, who act as mortgage loan originators. This part also applies  to non-federally insured credit unions and their employees, including  volunteers, who act as mortgage loan originators, subject to the  conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> De minimis exception. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This part and the requirements of 12  U.S.C. 5103(a)(1)(A) and (2) of the S.A.F.E. Act do not apply to any  employee of a national bank, member bank, insured state nonmember bank,  savings association, Farm Credit System institution, or credit union who  has never been registered or licensed through the Registry as a mortgage  loan originator if during the past 12 months the employee acted as a  mortgage loan originator for 5 or fewer residential mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to engaging in mortgage loan origination activity that  exceeds the exception limit in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, an  employee must register with the Registry pursuant to this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Evasion. National banks, member banks, insured state nonmember  banks, savings associations, Farm Credit System institutions, and credit  unions are prohibited from engaging in any act or practice to evade the  limits of the de minimis exception set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For non-federally insured credit unions. A non-federally insured  credit union in a state identified on the National Credit Union  Administration's Web site (NCUA.gov) as one where the appropriate state  supervisory authority has executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  with the National Credit Union Administration may register under this  rule provided that any Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry  listing of the non-federally insured credit union and its employees  contains a clear and conspicuous statement that the non-federally  insured credit union is not insured by the National Credit Union Share  Insurance Fund, and the state supervisory authority where the non- federally insured credit union is located maintains an agreement with  the National Credit Union Administration for this registration process  and oversight. If the state supervisory authority where the non- federally insured credit union is located fails to maintain such an  agreement, the non-federally insured credit union and its employees in  that state may not register or maintain registration under the Federal  system. They instead must use the appropriate state licensing and  registration system, or if the state does not have such a system, the  licensing and registration system established by the Bureau for mortgage  loan originators and their employees.</p>
