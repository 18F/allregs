                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.274-1 through 1.274-5, inclusive, do not apply to any deduction allowable to the taxpayer without regard to its connection with the taxpayer's trade or business or other income producing activity. Examples of such items are interest, taxes such as real property taxes, and casualty losses. Thus, if a taxpayer owned a fishing camp, the taxpayer could still deduct mortgage interest and real property taxes in full even if deductions for its use are not allowable under section 274(a) and Sec. 1.274-2. In the case of a taxpayer which is not an individual, the provisions of this section shall be applied as if it were an individual. Thus, if a corporation sustains a casualty loss on an entertainment facility used in its trade or business, it could deduct the loss even though deductions for the use of the facility are not allowable.

Sec. 1.274-6T  Substantiation with respect to certain types of listedproperty for taxable years beginning after 1985 (temporary).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written policy statements as to vehicles--(1) In general. Two types of written policy statements satisfying the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section, if initiated and kept by an employer to implement a policy of no personal use, or no personal use except for commuting, of a vehicle provided by the employer, qualify as sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer's own statement and therefore will satisfy the employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d). Therefore, the employee need not keep a separate set of records for purposes of the employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d) with respect to use of a vehicle satisfying these written policy statement rules. A written policy statement adopted by a governmental unit as to employee use of its vehicles is eligible for these exceptions to the section 274(d) substantiation rules. Thus, a resolution of a city council or a provision of state law or a state constitution would qualify as a written policy statement, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

An employee, in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of an employer-provided vehicle under Sec. 1.274-5T, may substantiate any exclusion allowed under section 132 for a working condition fringe by including in income the commuting value of the vehicle (determined by the employer pursuant to Sec. 1.61-2T(f)(3)) if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business and is used in the employer's trade or business,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Under a written policy of the employer, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the way between a business delivery and the employee's home),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a control

There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine whether the use of the vehicle met the preceding six conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicles used in connection with the business of farming--(1) In general. If, during a taxable year or shorter period, a vehicle, not otherwise described in section 274(i), Sec. 1.274-5T(k), or paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section, is owned or leased by an employer and used during most of a normal business day directly in connection with the business of farming (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the employer, in lieu of substantiating the use of the vehicle as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T(b)(6)(i)(B), may determine any deduction or credit with respect to the vehicle as if the business/investment use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) and the qualified business use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)) of the vehicle in the business of farming for the taxable year or shorter period were 75 percent plus that percentage, if any, attributable to an amount included in an employee's gross income. If the vehicle is also available for personal use by employees, the employer must include the value of that personal use in the gross income of the employees, allocated among them in the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.132-5T(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If, during a taxable year or shorter period, a vehicle, not otherwise described in section 274(i), Sec. 1.274-5T(k), or paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section, is owned or leased by an employer and used during most of a normal business day directly in connection with the business of farming (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the employer, in lieu of substantiating the use of the vehicle as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T(b)(6)(i)(B), may determine any deduction or credit with respect to the vehicle as if the business/investment use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) and the qualified business use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)) of the vehicle in the business of farming for the taxable year or shorter period were 75 percent plus that percentage, if any, attributable to an amount included in an employee's gross income. If the vehicle is also available for personal use by employees, the employer must include the value of that personal use in the gross income of the employees, allocated among them in the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.132-5T(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Directly in connection with the business of farming. The phrase directly in connection with the business of farming means that the vehicle must be used directly in connection with the business of operating a farm (i.e., cultivating land or raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, or the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of animals) or incidental thereto (for example, trips to the feed and supply store).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substantiation by employees. If an employee is provided with the use of a vehicle to which this paragraph (b) applies, the employee may, in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of the vehicle in the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T, substantiate any exclusion allowed under section 132 for a working condition fringe as if the business/investment use of the vehicle were 75 percent, plus that percentage, if any, determined by the employer to be attributable to the use of the vehicle by individuals other than the employee, provided that the employee includes in gross income the amount determined by the employer as includible in the employee's gross income. See Sec. 1.132-5T(g)(3) for examples illustrating the allocation of use of a vehicle among employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicles treated as used entirely for personal purposes. An employer may satisfy the substantiation requirements under section 274(d) for a taxable year or shorter period with respect to the business use of a vehicle that is provided to an employee by including the value of the availability of the vehicle during the relevant period in the employee's gross income without any exclusion for a working condition fringe with respect to the vehicle and, if required, by withholding any taxes. Under these circumstances, the employer's business/investment use of the vehicle during the relevant period is 100 percent. The employer's qualified business use of the vehicle is dependent upon the relationship of the employee to the employer (see Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation. If a taxpayer chooses to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and Sec. 1.274-5T by using one of the methods prescribed in paragraphs (a) (2) or (3), (b), or (c) of this section and files a return with the Internal Revenue Service for a taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may not later use another of these methods. Similarly, if a taxpayer chooses to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) in the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T and files a return with the Internal Revenue Service for a taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may not later use a method prescribed in paragraph (a) (2) or (3), (b), or (c) of this section. This rule applies to an employee for purposes of substantiating any working condition fringe

exclusion as well as to an employer. For example, if an employee excludes on his federal income tax return for a taxable year 90 percent of the value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile on the basis of records that allegedly satisfy the ``adequate records'' requirement of Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(2), and that requirement is not satisfied, then the employee may not satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) for the taxable year by any method prescribed in this section, but may present other corroborative evidence as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions--(1) In general. The definitions provided in this paragraph (e) apply for purposes of section 274(d), Sec. 1.274-5T, and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The definitions provided in this paragraph (e) apply for purposes of section 274(d), Sec. 1.274-5T, and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employer and employee. The terms employer and employee include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sole proprietor shall be treated as both an employer and employee,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A partnership shall be treated as an employer of its partners, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A partner shall be treated as an employee of the partnership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Automobile. The term automobile has the same meaning as prescribed in Sec. 1.61-2T(d)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vehicle. The term vehicle has the same meaning as prescribed in Sec. 1.61-2T(e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Personal use. Personal use by an employee of an employer-provided vehicle includes use in any trade or business other than the trade or business of being the employee of the employer providing the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1985.
