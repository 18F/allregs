                                Sec. 531.34  Payment in scrip or similar medium not authorized.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Scrip, tokens, credit cards, ``dope checks,'' coupons, and similar devices are not proper mediums of payment under the Act. They are neither cash nor ``other facilities'' within the meaning of section 3(m). However, the use of such devices for the purpose of conveniently and accurately measuring wages earned or facilities furnished during a single pay period is not prohibited. Piecework earnings, for example, may be calculated by issuing tokens (representing a fixed amount of work performed) to the employee, which are redeemed at the end of the pay period for cash. The tokens do not discharge the obligation of the employer to pay wages, but they may enable him to determine the amount of cash which is due to the employee. Similarly, board, lodging, or other facilities may be furnished during the pay period in exchange for scrip or coupons issued prior to the end of the pay period. The reasonable cost of furnishing such facilities may be included as part of the wage, since payment is being made not in scrip but in facilities furnished under the requirements of section 3(m). But the employer may not credit himself with ``unused scrip'' or ``coupons outstanding'' on the pay day in determining whether he has met the requirements of the Act because such scrip or coupons have not been redeemed for cash or facilities within the pay period. Similarly, the employee cannot be charged with the loss or destruction of scrip or tokens.


Sec. 531.35  ``Free and clear'' payment; ``kickbacks.''</p><p class="depth0">Whether in cash or in facilities, ``wages'' cannot be considered to have been paid by the employer and received by the employee unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or ``free and clear.'' The wage requirements of the Act will not be met where the employee ``kicks-back'' directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer's benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee. This is true whether the ``kick-back'' is made in cash or in other than cash. For example, if it is a requirement of the employer that the employee must provide tools of the trade which will be used in or are specifically required for the performance of the employer's particular work, there would be a violation of the Act in any workweek when the cost of such tools purchased by the employee cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under the Act. See also in this connection, Sec. 531.32(c).</p><p class="depth0">Payment Where Additions or Deductions Are Involved</p>
