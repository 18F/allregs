However, a facility may not use the dispute resolution processes at both Sec. 488.331 and Sec. 488.431 for the same deficiency citation arising from the same survey unless the informal dispute resolution process at Sec. 488.331 was completed prior to the imposition of the civil money penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Failure of the State or CMS, as appropriate, to complete informal dispute resolution timely cannot delay the effective date of any enforcement action against the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Failure of the State or CMS, as appropriate, to complete informal dispute resolution timely cannot delay the effective date of any enforcement action against the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A facility may not seek a delay of any enforcement action against it on the grounds that informal dispute resolution has not been completed before the effective date of the enforcement action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a provider is subsequently successful, during the informal dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that deficiencies should not have been cited, the deficiencies are removed from the statement of deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as a result of those cited deficiencies are rescinded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notification.
