                                Sec. 600.1014  Fee collection deposits, disbursements, records,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deposit accounts. Each fish buyer that this subpart requires to  collect a fee shall maintain a segregated account at a federally insured  financial institution for the sole purpose of depositing collected fee  revenue and disbursing the fee revenue directly to NMFS in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fee collection deposits. Each fish buyer, no less frequently  than at the end of each business week, shall deposit, in the deposit  account established under paragraph (a) of this section, all fee  revenue, not previously deposited, that the fish buyer collects through  a date not more than two calendar days before the date of deposit.  Neither the deposit account nor the principal amount of deposits in the  account may be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose other than  aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the Fund in  accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The   fish buyer is entitled, at any time, to withdraw deposit interest, if  any, but never deposit principal, from the deposit account for the fish  buyer's own use and purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deposit principal disbursement. On the last business day of each  month, or more frequently if the amount in the account exceeds the  account limit for insurance purposes, the fish buyer shall disburse to  NMFS the full amount of deposit principal then in the deposit account.  The fish buyer shall do this by check made payable to the Fund  subaccount to which the deposit principal relates. The fish buyer shall  mail each such check to the Fund subaccount lockbox that NMFS  establishes for the receipt of the disbursements for each program. Each  disbursement shall be accompanied by the fish buyer's settlement sheet  completed in the manner and form that NMFS specifies. NMFS will specify  the Fund subaccount lockbox and the manner and form of settlement sheet  by means of the notification in Sec. 600.1013(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Records maintenance. Each fish buyer shall maintain, in a secure  and orderly manner for a period of at least 3 years from the date of  each transaction involved, at least the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For all deliveries of fee fish that the fish buyer buys from  each fish seller:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date of delivery,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The seller's identity,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The weight, number, or volume of each species of fee fish  delivered,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The identity of the fishing vessel that delivered the fee fish,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The delivery value of each species of fee fish,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The net delivery value,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The identity of the party to whom the net delivery value is  paid, if other than the fish seller,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The date the net delivery value was paid, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The total fee amount collected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For all fee collection deposits to and disbursements from the  deposit account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The dates and amounts of deposits,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dates and amounts of disbursements to the Fund's lockbox  account, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The dates and amounts of disbursements to the fish buyer or  other parties of interest earned on deposits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annual report. In each year, on the date to be specified in each  implementation regulation, succeeding the year during which NMFS first  implemented a fee, each fish buyer shall submit to NMFS a report, on or  in the form NMFS specifies, containing the following information for the  preceding year, or whatever longer period may be involved in the first  annual report, for all fee fish each fish buyer purchases from fish  sellers: (1) Total weight, number, or volume bought;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total delivery value paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Total fee amounts collected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Total fee collection amounts deposited by month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dates and amounts of monthly disbursements to each Fund lockbox  account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Total amount of interest earned on deposits; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Depository account balance at year-end.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> State records. If landing records that a state requires from  fish sellers contain some or all of the data that this section requires  and state confidentiality laws or regulations do not prevent NMFS'  access to the records maintained for the state, then fish buyers can use  such records to meet appropriate portions of this section's  recordkeeping requirements. If, however, state confidentiality laws or  regulations make such records unavailable to NMFS, then fish buyers  shall maintain separate records for NMFS that meet the requirements of  this section. If any state law or regulation prohibits fish buyers, or  fish sellers where appropriate, from keeping, for the purpose of  complying with any requirement of this section, separate records that  involve some or all of the same data elements as the landing records  that the fish buyers also keep, for state purposes and under state law  or regulation, then a financed reduction program will not be possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Audits. NMFS or its agents may audit, in whatever manner NMFS  believes reasonably necessary for the duly diligent administration of  reduction loans, the financial records of fish   buyers and fish sellers in each reduction fishery in order to ensure  proper fee payment, collection, deposit, disbursement, accounting,  record keeping, and reporting. Fish buyers and fish sellers shall make  all records of all program transactions involving post-reduction fish  harvests, fish deliveries, and fee payments, collections, deposits,  disbursements, accounting, record keeping, and reporting available to  NMFS or NMFS' agents at reasonable times and places and promptly provide  all requested information reasonably related to these records that such  fish sellers and fish buyers may otherwise lawfully provide. Trip  tickets (or similar accounting records establishing the pounds of fee  fish that each fish buyer buys from each fish seller each time that each  fish buyer does so and each price that each fish buyer then pays to each  fish seller for the fee fish) are essential audit documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Confidentiality of records. NMFS and NMFS' auditing agents shall  maintain the confidentiality of all data to which NMFS has access under  this section and shall neither release the data nor allow the data's use  for any purpose other than the purpose of this subpart; provided,  however, that NMFS may aggregate such data so as to preclude their  identification with any fish buyer or any fish seller and use them in  the aggregate for other purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Refunds. When NMFS determines that a reduction loan is fully  repaid, NMFS will refund any excess fee receipts, on a last-in/first-out  basis, to the fish buyers. Fish buyers shall return the refunds, on a  last-in/first-out basis, to the fish sellers who paid the amounts  refunded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Implementation regulations at variance with this section. If any  special circumstances in a reduction fishery require, in NMFS's  judgment, fee collection deposit, disbursement, or records provisions in  addition to, or different from, those in this section in order to  accommodate the circumstances of, and practices in, a reduction fishery  while still fulfilling the intent and purpose of this section, NMFS may,  notwithstanding this section, include such provisions in the  implementation regulations for such reduction fishery.</p>
