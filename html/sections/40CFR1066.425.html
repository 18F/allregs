                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> See the standard-setting part for drive schedules. These are  defined by a smooth fit of a specified speed vs. time sequence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this  section. Instantaneous speeds must stay within the following tolerances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The upper limit is 2.0 mph higher than the highest point on the  trace within 1.0 s of the given point in time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lower limit is 2.0 mph lower than the lowest point on the  trace within 1.0 s of the given time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The same limits apply for vehicle operation without exhaust  measurements, such as vehicle preconditioning and warm-up, except that  the upper and lower limits for speed values are 4.0 mph. In addition, up to three occurrences of speed  variations greater than the tolerance are acceptable for vehicle  operation in which no exhaust emission standards apply, as long as they  occur for less than 15 seconds on any occasion and are clearly  documented as to the time and speed at that point of the driving  schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>. Speed  variations (such as may occur during gear changes or braking spikes) may  occur as follows, as long as such variations are clearly documented,  including the time and speed values and the reason for the deviation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Speed variations greater than the specified limits are  acceptable for up to 2.0 seconds on any occasion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For vehicles that are not able to maintain acceleration as  specified in Sec.  1066.415(e)(5), do not count the insufficient  acceleration as being outside the specified limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We may approve an alternate test cycle and cycle-validation  criteria for vehicles that do not have enough power to follow the  specified driving trace. The alternate driving specifications must be  based on making best efforts to maintain acceleration and speed to  follow the specified test cycle. We must approve these alternate driving  specifications before you perform this testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Figure 1 and Figure 2 of this section show the range of  acceptable speed tolerances for typical points during testing. Figure 1  of this section is typical of portions of the speed curve that are  increasing or decreasing throughout the 2-second time interval. Figure 2  of this section is typical of portions of the speed curve that include a  maximum or minimum value.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.086  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.087</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Start testing as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a vehicle is already running and warmed up, and starting is  not part of the test cycle, operate the vehicle as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For transient test cycles, control vehicle speeds to follow a  drive schedule consisting of a series of idles, accelerations, cruises,  and decelerations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For cruise test cycles, control the vehicle operation to match  the speed of the first interval of the test cycle. Follow the  instructions in the standard-setting part to determine how long to  stabilize the vehicle during each interval, how long to sample emissions  at each interval, and how to transition between intervals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If engine starting is part of the test cycle, start recording  continuous data, turn on any electronic integrating devices, and start  batch sampling before starting the engine. Initiate the driver's trace  when the engine starts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Perform the following at the end of each test interval, except  as specified in standard-setting part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shut down the vehicle if it is part of the test cycle or if  testing is complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continue to operate all sampling and dilution systems to allow  the response times to elapse. Then stop all sampling and recording,  including background sampling. Finally, stop any integrating devices and  indicate the end of the duty cycle in the recorded data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If testing involves engine shutdown followed by another test  interval, start a timer for the vehicle soak when the engine shuts down.  Turn off cooling fans, close the engine compartment cover (if  applicable), and turn off the CVS or disconnect the exhaust tube from  the vehicle's tailpipe(s) unless otherwise instructed in the standard- setting part. If testing is complete, disconnect the laboratory exhaust  tubing from the vehicle's tailpipe(s) and drive the vehicle from the  dynamometer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Take the following steps after emission sampling is complete:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any proportional batch sample, such as a bag sample or PM  sample, verify that proportional sampling was maintained according to 40  CFR 1065.545. Void any samples that did not maintain proportional  sampling according to those specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Place any used PM samples into covered or sealed containers and  return them to the PM-stabilization environment. Follow the PM sample  post-conditioning and total weighing procedures in 40 CFR 1065.595.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As soon as practical after the interval or test cycle is  complete, or optionally during the soak period if practical, perform the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Begin drift check for all continuous gas analyzers as described  in paragraph (g)(5) of this section and zero and span all batch gas  analyzers as soon as practical before any batch sample analysis. You may  perform this batch analyzer zero and span before the end of the test  interval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Analyze any conventional gaseous batch samples (HC,  CH4, CO, NOX, and CO2) no later than 30  minutes after a test interval is complete, or during the soak period if  practical. Analyze background samples no later than 60 minutes after the  test interval is complete.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Analyze nonconventional gaseous batch samples (including  background), such as NMHCE, N2O, or NMOG sampling with  ethanol, as soon as practicable using good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an analyzer operated above 100% of its range at any time  during the test, perform the following steps:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For batch sampling, re-analyze the sample using the lowest  analyzer range that results in a maximum instrument response below 100%.  Report the result from the lowest range from which the analyzer operates  below 100% of its range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For continuous sampling, repeat the entire test using the next  higher analyzer range. If the analyzer again operates above 100% of its  range, repeat the test using the next higher range. Continue to repeat  the test until the analyzer consistently operates at less than 100% of  its range. Keep records of any tests where the analyzer exceeds its  range. We may consider these results to determine that the test vehicle  exceeded an emission standard, consistent with good engineering  judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After quantifying exhaust gases, verify drift as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For batch and continuous gas analyzers, record the mean analyzer  value after stabilizing a zero gas to the analyzer. Stabilization may  include time   to purge the analyzer of any sample gas, plus any additional time to  account for analyzer response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Record the mean analyzer value after stabilizing the span gas  to the analyzer. Stabilization may include time to purge the analyzer of  any sample gas, plus any additional time to account for analyzer  response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use these data to verify that analyzer drift does not exceed  2.0% of the analyzer full scale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Measure and record ambient pressure. Measure and record ambient  temperature continuously to verify that it remains within the  temperature range specified in Sec.  1066.420(c)(1) throughout the test.  Also measure humidity if required, such as for correcting NOX  emissions, or meeting the requirements of Sec.  1066.420(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, determine overall  driver accuracy as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compare the following drive-cycle metrics, based on measured  vehicle speeds, to a reference value based on the target cycle that  would have been generated by driving exactly to the target trace as  described in SAE J2951 (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1066.1010):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the Energy Economy Rating as described in Section 5.4  of SAE J2951.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the Absolute Speed Change Rating as described in  Section 5.5 of SAE J2951.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the Inertia Work Rating as described in Section 5.6  of SAE J2951.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Determine the phase-weighted composite Energy Based Drive  Metrics for the criteria specified in this paragraph (j)(1) as described  in Section 5.7 of SAE J2951.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The standard-setting part may require you to give us 10 Hz data  to characterize both target and actual values for cycle energy.  Calculate target values based on the vehicles speeds from the specified  test cycle.</p>
