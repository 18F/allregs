                            <p class="depth0">At the formal request of the Board, to be made before January 14, 1976, the Governor may appoint a council for the State. Those council members who are attorneys admitted to practice in the State shall be appointed by the Governor after recommendations have been received from the State bar association. In making such appointments, it is recommended the Governor consult with other bar associations in the State, representatives of groups concerned with the interests of recipients, eligible clients and other interested groups. It is recommended that the Governor appoint attorneys who have interest in and knowledge of the delivery of quality legal services to the poor, and that the remaining members of the council, who are not attorneys, be selected after the Governor has consulted with representatives of groups concerned with the interests of eligible clients. It is recommended that the Governor seek recommendations from recipients in the State before appointing any members to the council. Sixty days prior to the expiration of a member's term, the Governor shall notify those groups mentioned in this Section so that their recommendations may be solicited for purposes of appointment of a new member or reappointment of an incumbent member of the council.</p>
