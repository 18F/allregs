processes operating within the geologic setting shall permit compliance with (1) the requirements specified in Sec. 960.4-1 for radionuclide releases to the accessible environment and (2) the requirements set forth in 10 CFR 60.113 for radionuclide releases from the engineered-barrier system using reasonably available technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Favorable Conditions.
