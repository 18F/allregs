                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. SBA allots to each PSB Surety a periodic maximum  guarantee authority. No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved by a  PSB Surety if the bonds exceed the allotted authority for the period in  which the bonds are   approved. No reliance on future authority is permitted. An allotment can  be increased only by prior written permission of SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Execution of Bid Bonds. When the PSB Surety Executes a Bid Bond,  SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee  percentage of the estimated penal sum of the Final Bond SBA would  guarantee if the Contract were awarded. If the Contract is then awarded  for an amount other than the bid amount, or if the bid is withdrawn or  the Bid Bond guarantee has expired (see Sec. 115.12(c)), SBA debits or  credits the Surety's allotment accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Execution of Final Bonds. If the PSB Surety Executes a  guaranteed Final Bond, but not the related Bid Bond, SBA debits the  Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of  the penal sum of the Final Bond. SBA will debit the allotment for  increases, and credit the allotment for decreases, in the bond amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release and non-issuance of Final Bonds. The release of Final  Bonds upon completion of the Contract does not restore the corresponding  allotment. If, however, a PSB Surety approves a Final Bond but never  issues the bond, SBA will credit the Surety's allotment for an amount  equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the bond. In that  event, the Surety must notify SBA as soon as possible, but in no event  later than 5 business days after the non-issuance has been determined.  Until the Surety has so notified SBA, it cannot rely on such credit.</p>
