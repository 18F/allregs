                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adherence to Department of State regulations. Sponsors are  required to adhere to all regulations set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Legal status. A sponsor must maintain the legal status it had  when it was designated. A sponsor's change in legal status (e.g., from  partnership to corporation, non-profit to for-profit) requires the  submission of a new application for designation of the successor legal  entity within 45 days of the change in legal status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accreditation and licensure. A sponsor must remain in compliance  with all local, state, and federal laws, and professional requirements  necessary to carry out the activities for which it is designated,  including accreditation and licensure, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Representations and disclosures. Sponsors must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide accurate, complete, and timely information, to the  extent lawfully permitted, to the Department of State and the Department  of Homeland Security regarding their exchange visitor program(s),  exchange visitors, and accompanying spouses and dependents (if any);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide accurate information to the public when advertising  their exchange visitor program(s) or responding to public inquiries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide accurate program information and materials to  prospective exchange visitors, host organizations, and host employers,  if applicable, at the time of recruitment and before exchange visitors  enter into agreements   and/or pay non-refundable fees. This information must clearly explain  program activities and terms and conditions of program, including the  terms and conditions of any employment activities (job duties, number of  work hours, wages and compensation, and any typical deductions for  housing and transportation), have itemized list of all fees charged to  the exchange visitor (i.e., fees paid to the sponsor or a third party,  including the host employer), insurance costs, other typical costs,  conditions, and restrictions of the exchange visitor program(s), and the  type, duration, nature and importance of the cultural components of the  program. Program recruitment information and materials also must make  clear to prospective exchange visitors in the exchange categories with a  work component that their stipend or wages might not cover all of their  expenses and that they should bring additional personal funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not use the program number(s) assigned by the Department of  State at the time of designation on any advertising materials or  publications, including sponsor Web sites; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not represent that its exchange visitor program is endorsed,  sponsored, or supported by the Department of State or the U.S.  Government, except for U.S. Government sponsors or exchange visitor  programs financed directly by the U.S. Government to promote  international educational exchanges. A sponsor may, however, represent  that it is designated by the Department of State as a sponsor of an  exchange visitor program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Financial responsibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sponsors must maintain the  financial capability to meet at all times their financial obligations  and responsibilities attendant to successful sponsorship of their  exchange visitor program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department of State may require non-government sponsors to  provide evidence satisfactory to the Department of State that funds  necessary to fulfill all obligations and responsibilities attendant to  sponsorship of their exchange visitor programs are readily available and  in the sponsor's control, including such supplementary or explanatory  financial information as the Department of State may deem appropriate,  such as, for example, audited financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of State may require a non-government sponsor to  secure payment bonds in favor of the Department of State guaranteeing  all financial obligations arising from its exchange visitor program when  the Department has reasonable doubt about the sponsor's ability to meet  its program and other financial obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Staffing and support services. Sponsors must ensure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequate staffing and sufficient support services are provided  to administer their exchange visitor program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Their employees, officers, agents, third parties, volunteers or  other individuals or entities associated with the administration of  their exchange visitor program are adequately qualified, appropriately  trained, and comply with the Exchange Visitor Program regulations and  immigration laws pertaining to the administration of their exchange  visitor program(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Appointment of Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible  Officers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sponsors must appoint and maintain a Responsible Officer  and between one and ten Alternate Responsible Officers to assist the  Responsible Officer in performing the duties set forth in Sec. 62.11.  Upon written sponsor request, the Department of State may, in its sole  discretion, permit a sponsor to appoint more than ten Alternate  Responsible Officers. A sponsor redesignated for two years must ensure  that the proposed Responsible Officer and Alternate Responsible  Officer(s) have undergone a criminal background check within the past  four years to determine their suitability for these positions.  Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers must be U.S.  persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers must be  employees or officers of the sponsor. Upon written sponsor request, the  Department of State may, in its sole discretion, authorize the  appointment of an individual who is not an employee or officer to serve  as an Alternate Responsible Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event of the departure of a Responsible Officer or  Alternate Responsible Officer, the sponsor must file   a request in SEVIS for the approval of a replacement and forward the  required documentation to the Department of State within ten calendar  days from the date of the Responsible Officer's or Alternate Responsible  Officer's departure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests to replace the Responsible Officer or add an Alternate  Responsible Officer must be submitted in SEVIS, and a signed Form DS- 3037 must be either mailed or emailed to the Department of State with  the required completed Citizenship Certification, along with  certification that the individual has undergone a criminal background  check conducted at the time of such Certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Department of State reserves the right to deny the  appointment of a Responsible Officer or an Alternate Responsible  Officer.
