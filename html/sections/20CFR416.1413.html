                            <p class="depth0">If you request reconsideration, we will give you a chance to present your case. How you can present your case depends upon the issue involved and whether you are asking us to reconsider an initial determination on an application or an initial determination on a suspension, reduction or termination of benefits. The methods of reconsideration include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Case review. We will give you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity to review the evidence in our files and then to present oral and written evidence to us. We will then make a decision based on all of this evidence. The official who reviews the case will make the reconsidered determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Informal conference. In addition to following the procedures of a case review, an informal conference allows you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity to present witnesses. A summary record of this proceeding will become part of the case record. The official who conducts the informal conference will make the reconsidered determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formal conference. In addition to following the procedures of an informal conference, a formal conference allows you and the other parties to a reconsideration an opportunity to request us to subpoena adverse witnesses and relevant documents and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. A summary record of this proceeding will become a part of the case record. The official who conducts the formal conference will make the reconsidered determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disability hearing. If you have been receiving supplemental security income benefits because you are blind or disabled and you request reconsideration of an initial or revised determination that, based on medical factors, you are not now blind or disabled, we will give you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity for a disability hearing. (See Secs. 416.1414 through 416.1418.)

Sec. 416.1413a  Reconsiderations of initial determinations on applications.</p><p class="depth0">The method of reconsideration we will use when you appeal an initial determination on your application for benefits depends on the issue involved in your case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nonmedical issues. If you challenge our finding on a nonmedical issue, we shall offer you a case review or an informal conference, and will reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of the review you select.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical issues. If you challenge our finding on a medical issue (even if you received payments because we presumed you were blind or disabled), we shall reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of a case review.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980. Redesignated at 51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]


Sec. 416.1413b  Reconsideration procedures for post-eligiblity claims.</p><p class="depth0">If you are eligible for supplemental security income benefits and we notify you that we are going to suspend, reduce or terminate your benefits, you can appeal our determination within 60 days of the date you receive our notice. The 60-day period may be extended if you have good cause for an extension of time under the conditions stated in Sec. 416.1411(b). If you appeal a suspension, reduction, or termination of benefits, the method of reconsideration we will use depends on the issue in your case. If the issue in your case is that you are no longer blind or disabled for medical reasons, you will receive an opportunity for a disability hearing. If any other issue is involved, you have the

choice of a case review, informal conference or formal conference.
[51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]


Sec. 416.1413c  Arrangement for conferences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As soon as we receive a request for a formal or informal conference, we shall set the time, date and place for the conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We shall send you and any other parties to the reconsideration a written notice about the conference (either by mailing it to your last known address or by personally serving you with it) at least 10 days before the conference. However, we may hold the conference sooner if we all agree. We will not send written notice of the time, date, and place of the conference if you waive your right to receive it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We shall schedule the conference within 15 days after you request it, but, at our discretion or at your request, we will delay the conference if we think the delay will ensure that the conference is conducted efficiently and properly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We shall hold the conference at one of our offices, by telephone or in person, whichever you prefer. We will hold the conference elsewhere in person if you show circumstances that make this arrangement reasonably necessary.
