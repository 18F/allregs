                                Sec. 1003.107  Reinstatement after disbarment or suspension.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Expiration of suspension. Upon notice to the Board, a  practitioner who has been suspended will be reinstated to practice  before the Board and the Immigration Courts or DHS, or before all three  authorities, once the period of suspension has expired, provided that he  or she meets the definition of attorney or representative as set forth  in Sec. 1001.1(f) and (j), respectively, of this chapter. If a  practitioner cannot meet the definition of attorney or representative,  the Board shall decline to reinstate the practitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition for reinstatement. A practitioner who has been  disbarred or who has been suspended for one year or more may file a  petition for reinstatement directly with the Board after one-half of the  suspension period has expired or one year has passed, whichever is  greater, provided that he or she meets the definition of attorney or  representative as set forth in Sec. 1001.1(f) and (j), respectively, of  this chapter. A copy of such a petition shall be served on the EOIR  disciplinary counsel. In matters in which the practitioner was ordered  disbarred or suspended from practice before DHS, a copy of such petition  shall be served on DHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The practitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear  and convincing evidence that he or she possess the moral and  professional qualifications required to appear before the Board and the  Immigration Courts or DHS, or before all three authorities, and that his  or her reinstatement will not be detrimental to the administration of  justice. The EOIR disciplinary counsel and, in matters in which the  practitioner was ordered disbarred or suspended from practice before  DHS, DHS may reply within 30 days of service of the petition in the form  of a written response to the Board, which may include documentation of  any complaints filed against the expelled or suspended practitioner  subsequent to his or her disbarment or suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a practitioner cannot meet the definition of attorney or  representative as set forth in Sec. 1001.1(f) and (j), respectively, of  this chapter, the Board shall deny the petition for reinstatement  without further consideration. If the petition for reinstatement is  found to be otherwise inappropriate or unwarranted, the petition shall  be denied. Any subsequent petitions for reinstatement may not be filed  before the end of one year from the date of the Board's previous denial  of reinstatement. If the petition for reinstatement is determined to be  timely, the practitioner meets the definition of attorney or  representative, and the petitioner has otherwise set forth by the  requisite standard of proof that he or she possesses the qualifications  set forth herein, and that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the  administration of justice, the Board shall grant the petition and  reinstate the practitioner. The Board, in its discretion, may hold a  hearing to determine if the practitioner meets all of the requirements  for reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appearance after reinstatement. A practitioner who has been  reinstated to practice by the Board must file a new Notice of Entry of  Appearance of Attorney or Representative in each case on the form  required by applicable rules and regulations, even if the reinstated  practitioner previously filed such a form in a proceeding before the  practitioner was disciplined.
