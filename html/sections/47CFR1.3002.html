An employee shall not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directly or indirectly, solicit or coerce the offering of a gift, donation or bequest to the Commission from a regulated entity or other prohibited source; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accept gifts of cash pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral of offers to designated agency ethics official. Any person who seeks to offer any gift to the Commission under the provisions of this subpart shall make such offer to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. In addition, any Commission employee who is contacted by a potential donor or the representative thereof for the purpose of discussing the possibility of making a gift, donation or bequest to the Commission shall immediately refer such person or persons to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. The designated agency ethics official shall, in consultation with other agency ethics officials, make a determination concerning whether acceptance of such offers would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Agency ethics officials may also advise potential donors and their representatives of the types of equipment, property or services that may be of use to the Commission and the procedures for

effectuating gifts set forth in this subpart. The Commission may, in its discretion, afford public notice before accepting any gift under authority of this subpart.</p>
