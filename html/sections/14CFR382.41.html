                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As a carrier, you must provide the following information, on request, to qualified individuals with a disability or persons making inquiries on their behalf concerning the accessibility of the aircraft expected to make a particular flight. The information you provide must be specific to the aircraft you expect to use for the flight unless it is unfeasible for you to do so (e.g., because unpredictable circumstances such as weather or a mechanical problem require substitution of another aircraft that could affect the location or availability of an accommodation). The required information is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The specific location of seats, if any, with movable armrests (i.e., by row and seat number);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The specific location of seats (i.e., by row and seat number) that the carrier, consistent with this part, does not make available to passengers with a disability (e.g., exit row seats);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any aircraft-related, service-related or other limitations on the ability to accommodate passengers with a disability, including limitations on the availability of level-entry boarding to the aircraft at any airport involved with the flight. You must provide this information to any passenger who states that he or she uses a wheelchair for boarding, even if the passenger does not explicitly request the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other assistive devices commonly used by passengers with a disability, including storage in the cabin of a passenger's wheelchair as provided in Sec. Sec. 382.67 and 382.123 of this part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whether the aircraft has an accessible lavatory; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The types of services to passengers with a disability that are or are not available on the flight.</p>
