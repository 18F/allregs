For the  purpose of this section, this structure is termed ``fatigue critical  structure.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adverse effects of repairs, alterations, and modifications. The  maintenance program for the airplane includes a means for addressing the  adverse effects repairs, alterations, and modifications may have on  fatigue critical structure and on inspections required by paragraph  (c)(1) of this section.
