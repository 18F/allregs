                            <p class="depth0">Grants to the States of school lands in place (the numbered sections), of the character and status subject thereto, as a rule, are effective and operate to vest title upon the date of the approval of the statute making the grant or the date of the admission of the State into the Union, as to lands then surveyed, and as to the lands thereafter surveyed upon the date of the acceptance of the survey thereof by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. (United States v. Morrison, 240 U.S. 192, 60 L. ed. 599; United States v. Sweet, 245 U.S. 563, 62 L. ed. 473; Wyoming et al. v. United States, supra.) It is held, therefore, that the grant made by the first paragraph of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, subject to the provision therein with respect to indemnity or lieu lands, to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of said section 1 and following the plain provisions of subsection (a) thereof is effective upon the date of the approval of the Act (January 25, 1927) as to lands then surveyed and the survey thereof accepted by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management and as to the unsurveyed school sections in the State of Florida granted to that State by the Act of September 22, 1922. The grant, as to other lands thereafter surveyed, subject to the same provisions is effective upon the acceptance of the survey thereof as above indicated.</p>
