You must comply with state laws on consumer leasing, but only to the extent that the state leasing laws are consistent with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. 1667e, or provide the member with greater protections or benefits than the Consumer Leasing Act. You are also subject to the lending rules set forth in Sec. 701.21 of this chapter, except as provided in Sec. 714.8 and Sec. 714.9 of this part. The lending rules in Sec. 701.21 address the preemption of other state and federal laws that impact on credit transactions.
