                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal facilities and installations subject to Federal  oversight can, with the approval of the State or tribal agency  responsible for the SIP or TIP in that area, create an early emissions  reductions credit program. The Federal agency can create the emission  reduction credits in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b)  of this section and can use them in accordance with paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Creation of emission reduction credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emissions reductions must be quantifiable through the use of  standard emission factors or measurement techniques. If non-standard  factors or techniques to quantify the emissions reductions are used, the  Federal agency must receive approval from the State or tribal agency  responsible for the implementation of the SIP or TIP and from EPA's  Regional Office. The emission reduction credits do not have to be  quantified before the reduction strategy is implemented, but must be  quantified before the credits are used in the General Conformity  evaluation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission reduction methods must be consistent with the  applicable SIP or TIP attainment and reasonable further progress  demonstrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The emissions reductions cannot be required by or credited to  other applicable SIP or TIP provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Both the State or Tribe and Federal air quality agencies must be  able to take legal action to ensure continued implementation of the  emission reduction strategy. In addition, private citizens must also be  able to initiate action to ensure compliance with the control  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The emissions reductions must be permanent or the timeframe for  the reductions must be specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Federal agency must document the emissions reductions and  provide a copy of the document to the State or tribal air quality agency  and the EPA regional office for review. The documentation must include a  detailed description of the emission reduction strategy and a discussion  of how it meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of emission reduction credits. The emission reduction  credits created in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section can be  used, subject to the following limitations, to reduce the emissions  increase from a Federal action at the facility for the conformity  evaluation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the technique used to create the emission reduction is  implemented at the same facility as the Federal action and could have  occurred in conjunction with the Federal action, then the credits can be  used to reduce the total direct and indirect emissions used to determine  the applicability of the regulation as required in Sec. 93.153 and as  offsets or mitigation measures required by Sec. 93.158.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the technique used to create the emission reduction is not  implemented at the same facility as the Federal action or could not have  occurred in conjunction with the Federal action, then the credits cannot  be used to reduce the total direct and indirect emissions used to  determine the applicability of the regulation as required in  Sec. 93.153, but can be used to offset or mitigate the emissions as  required by Sec. 93.158.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emissions reductions credits must be used in the same year in  which they are generated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Once the emission reduction credits are used, they cannot be  used as credits for another conformity evaluation. However, unused  credits from a strategy used for one conformity evaluation can be used  for another conformity evaluation as long as the reduction credits are  not double counted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Federal agencies must notify the State or tribal air quality  agency responsible for the implementation of the SIP or TIP and EPA  Regional Office when the emission reduction credits are being used.
