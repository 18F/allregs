                            <p class="depth0">An alternate member of the committee shall act in the place and stead of the member for whom he is an alternate, during such member's absence or when designated to do so by the member for whom he is an alternate. In the event both a member and his alternate are unable to attend a committee meeting, the committee members present may designate another alternate of the same classification (handler or producer, and to the extent practical, independent, or co-op) to serve in such member's place and stead. In the event of the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification of a member, his alternate shall act for him until a successor of such member is selected and has qualified.
