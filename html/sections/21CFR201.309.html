                                Sec. 201.309  Acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In 1961, the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to its  statutory responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of drugs  shipped in interstate   commerce, began an active investigation of reports of possible toxic  effects and renal damage due to misuse of the drug acetophenetidin. This  study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that  misuse and prolonged use of the drug were in fact responsible for kidney  lesions and disease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December  1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible  Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin  (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of  scientists in the fields of pharmacology and medicine, on April 23,  1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and  recommended that all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing  preparations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On the basis of the studies made by the Food and Drug  Administration and the report of the Advisory Committee, the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is necessary for  the protection of users that the label and labeling of all  acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning  statement to the following effect: ``Warning--This medication may damage  the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do  not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer  than 10 days without consulting your physician.''</p>
