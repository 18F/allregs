                                Sec. 1.513-7  Travel and tour activities of tax exempt organizations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Travel tour activities that constitute a trade or business, as  defined in Sec. 1.513-1(b), and that are not substantially related to  the purposes for which exemption has been granted to the organization  constitute an unrelated trade or business with respect to that  organization. Whether travel tour activities conducted by an  organization are substantially related to the organization's exempt  purpose is determined by looking at all relevant facts and  circumstances, including, but not limited to, how a travel tour is  developed, promoted and operated. Section 513(c) and Sec. 1.513-1(b)  also apply to travel tour activity. Application of the rules of section  513(c) and Sec. 1.513-1(b) may result in different treatment for  individual tours within an organization's travel tour program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples. In all of these examples, the travel tours are  priced to produce a profit for the exempt organization. The examples are  as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. O, a university alumni association, is exempt from  federal income tax under section 501(a) as an educational organization  described in section 501(c)(3). As part of its activities, O operates a  travel tour program. The program is open to all current members of O and  their guests. O works with travel agencies to schedule approximately 10  tours annually to various destinations around the world. Members of O  pay $x to the organizing travel agency to participate in a tour. The  travel agency pays O a per person fee for each participant. Although the  literature advertising the tours encourages O's members to continue  their lifelong learning by joining the tours, and a faculty member of  O's related university frequently joins   the tour as a guest of the alumni association, none of the tours  includes any scheduled instruction or curriculum related to the  destinations being visited. The travel tours made available to O's  members do not contribute importantly to the accomplishment of O's  educational purpose. Rather, O's program is designed to generate  revenues for O by regularly offering its members travel services.  Accordingly, O's tour program is an unrelated trade or business within  the meaning of section 513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. N is an organization formed for the purpose of educating  individuals about the geography and culture of the United States. It is  exempt from federal income tax under section 501(a) as an educational  and cultural organization described in section 501(c)(3). N engages in a  number of activities to accomplish its purposes, including offering  courses and publishing periodicals and books. As one of its activities,  N conducts study tours to national parks and other locations within the  UnitedStates. The study tours are conducted by teachers and other  personnel certified by the Board of Education of the State of P. The  tours are directed toward students enrolled in degree programs at  educational institutions in P, as reflected in the promotional  materials, but are open to all who agree to participate in the required  study program. Each tour's study program consists of instruction on  subjects related to the location being visited on the tour. During the  tour, five or six hours per day are devoted to organized study,  preparation of reports, lectures, instruction and recitation by the  students. Each tour group brings along a library of material related to  the subject being studied on the tour. Examinations are given at the end  of each tour and the P StateBoard of Education awards academic credit  for tour participation. Because the tours offered by N include a  substantial amount of required study, lectures, report preparation,  examinations and qualify for academic credit, the tours are  substantially related to N's educational purpose. Accordingly, N's tour  program is not an unrelated trade or business within the meaning of  section 513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. R is a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization  devoted to advocacy on a particular issue. On a regular basis throughout  the year, R organizes travel tours for its members to Washington, DC.  While in Washington, the members follow a schedule according to which  they spend substantially all of their time during normal business hours  over several days attending meetings with legislators and government  officials and receiving briefings on policy developments related to the  issue that is R's focus. Members do have some time on their own in the  evenings to engage in recreational or social activities of their own  choosing. Bringing members to Washington to participate in advocacy on  behalf of the organization and learn about developments relating to the  organization's principal focus is substantially related to R's social  welfare purpose. Therefore, R's operation of the travel tours does not  constitute an unrelated trade or business within the meaning of section  513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. S is a membership organization formed to foster cultural  unity and to educate X Americans about X, their country of origin. It is  exempt from federal income tax under section 501(a) and is described in  section 501(c)(3) as an educational and cultural organization.  Membership in S is open to all Americans interested in the X heritage.  As part of its activities, S sponsors a program of travel tours to X.  The tours are divided into two categories. Category A tours are trips to  X that are designed to immerse participants in the X history, culture  and language. Substantially all of the daily itinerary includes  scheduled instruction on the X language, history and cultural heritage,  and visits to destinations selected because of their historical or  cultural significance or because of instructional resources they offer.  Category B tours are also trips to X, but rather than offering scheduled  instruction, participants are given the option of taking guided tours of  various X locations included in their itinerary. Other than the optional  guided tours, Category B tours offer no instruction or curriculum.  Destinations of principally recreational interest, rather than  historical or cultural interest, are regularly included on Category B  tour itineraries. Based on the facts and circumstances, sponsoring  Category A tours is an activity substantially related to S's exempt  purposes, and does not constitute an unrelated trade or business within  the meaning of section 513(a). However, sponsoring Category B tours does  not contribute importantly to S's accomplishment of its exempt purposes  and, thus, constitutes an unrelated trade or business within the meaning  of section 513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. T is a scientific organization engaged in environmental  research. T is exempt from federal income tax under section 501(a) as an  organization described in section 501(c)(3). T is engaged in a long-term  study of how agricultural pesticide and fertilizer use affects the  populations of various bird species. T collects data at several bases  located in an important agricultural region of country U. The minutes of  a meeting of T's Board of Directors state that, after study, the Board  has determined that non-scientists can reliably perform needed data  collection in the field, under supervision of T's biologists. The Board  minutes reflect that the Board approved offering one-week trips to T's  bases in U, where participants will assist T's biologists in collecting  data for the study. Tour participants collect data during the same hours  as T's biologists. Normally,   data collection occurs during the early morning and evening hours,  although the work schedule varies by season. Each base has rustic  accommodations and few amenities, but country U is renowned for its  beautiful scenery and abundant wildlife. T promotes the trips in its  newsletter and on its Internet site and through various conservation  organizations. The promotional materials describe the work schedule and  emphasize the valuable contribution made by trip participants to T's  research activities. Based on the facts and circumstances, sponsoring  trips to T's bases in country U is an activity substantially related to  T's exempt purpose, and, thus, does not constitute an unrelated trade or  business within the meaning of section 513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. V is an educational organization devoted to the study of  ancient history and cultures and is exempt from federal income tax under  section 501(a) as an organization described in section 501(c)(3). In  connection with its educational activities, V conducts archaeological  expeditions around the world, including in the Y region of country Z. In  cooperation with the National Museum of Z, V recently presented an  exhibit on ancient civilizations of the Y region of Z, including  artifacts from the collection of the Z National Museum. V instituted a  program of travel tours to V's archaeological sites located in the Y  region. The tours were initially proposed by V staff members as a means  of educating the public about ongoing field research conducted by V. V  engaged a travel agency to handle logistics such as accommodations and  transportation arrangements. In preparation for the tours, V developed  educational materials relating to each archaeological site to be visited  on the tour, describing in detail the layout of the site, the methods  used by V's researchers in exploring the site, the discoveries made at  the site, and their historical significance. V also arranged special  guided tours of its exhibit on the Y region for individuals registered  for the travel tours. Two archaeologists from V (both of whom had  participated in prior archaeological expeditions in the Y region)  accompanied the tours. These experts led guided tours of each site and  explained the significance of the sites to tour participants. At several  of the sites, tour participants also met with a working team of  archaeologists from V and the National Museum of Z, who shared their  experiences. V prepared promotional materials describing the educational  nature of the tours, including the daily trips to V's archaeological  sites and the educational background of the tour leaders, and providing  a recommended reading list. The promotional materials do not refer to  any particular recreational or sightseeing activities. Based on the  facts and circumstances, sponsoring trips to the Y region is an activity  substantially related to V's exempt purposes. The scheduled activities,  which include tours of archaeological sites led by experts, are part of  a coordinated educational program designed to educate tour participants  about the ancient history of the Y region of Z and V's ongoing field  research. Therefore, V's tour program does not constitute an unrelated  trade or business within the meaning of section 513(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. W is an educational organization devoted to the study of  the performing arts and is exempt from federal income tax under section  501(a) as an organization described in section 501(c)(3). In connection  with its educational activities, W presents public performances of  musical and theatrical works. Individuals become members of W by making  an annual contribution to W of $q. Each year, W offers members an  opportunity to travel as a group to one or more major cities in the  United States or abroad. In each city, tour participants are provided  tickets to attend a public performance of a play, concert or dance  program each evening. W also arranges a sightseeing tour of each city  and provides evening receptions for tour participants. W views its tour  program as an important means to develop and strengthen bonds between W  and its members, and to increase their financial and volunteer support  of W. W engaged a travel agency to handle logistics such as  accommodations and transportation arrangements. No educational materials  are prepared by W or provided to tour participants in connection with  the tours. Apart from attendance at the evening cultural events, the  tours offer no scheduled instruction, organized study or group  discussion. Although several members of W's administrative staff  accompany each tour group, their role is to facilitate member  interaction. The staff members have no special expertise in the  performing arts and play no educational role in the tours. W prepared  promotional materials describing the sightseeing opportunities on the  tours and emphasizing the opportunity for members to socialize  informally and interact with one another and with W staff members, while  pursuing shared interests. Although W's tour program may foster goodwill  among W members, it does not contribute importantly to W's educational  purposes. W's tour program is primarily social and recreational in  nature. The scheduled activities, which include sightseeing and  attendance at various cultural events, are not part of a coordinated  educational program. Therefore, W's tour program is an unrelated trade  or business within the meaning of section 513(a).  [T.D. 8874, 65 FR 5773, Feb. 7, 2000; 65 FR 16143, Mar. 27, 2000]    Sec. 1.514(a)-1  Unrelated debt-financed income and deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Income includible in gross income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Percentage of income taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, there shall be included  with respect to each debt-financed property (as defined in section 514  and Sec. 1.514(b)-1) as an item of gross income derived from an  unrelated trade or business the amount of unrelated debt-financed income  (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph). See paragraph  (a)(5) of Sec. 1.514(c)-1 for special rules regarding indebtedness  incurred before June 28, 1966, applicable for taxable years beginning  before January 1, 1972, and for special rules applicable to churches or  conventions or associations of churches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unrelated debt-financed income. The unrelated debt-financed  income with respect to each debt-financed property is an amount which is  the same percentage (but not in excess of 100 percent) of the total  gross income derived during the taxable year from or on account of such  property as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The average acquisition indebtedness (as defined in subparagraph  (3) of this paragraph) with respect to the property is of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The average adjusted basis of such property (as defined in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Debt/basis percentage. The percentage determined under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is hereinafter referred to as the  debt/basis percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. Subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph  are illustrated by the following example. For purposes of this example  it is assumed that the property is debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example. X, an exempt trade association, owns an office building  which in 1971 produces $10,000 of gross rental income. The average  adjusted basis of the building for 1971 is $100,000, and the average  acquisition indebtedness with respect to the building for 1971 is  $50,000. Accordingly, the debt/basis percentage for 1971 is 50 percent  (the ratio of $50,000 to $100,000). Therefore, the unrelated debt- financed income with respect to the building for 1971 is $5,000 (50  percent of $10,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Gain from sale or other disposition. If debt-financed property  is sold or otherwise disposed of, there shall be included in computing  unrelated business taxable income an amount with respect to such gain  (or loss) which is the same percentage (but not in excess of 100  percent) of the total gain (or loss) derived from such sale or other  disposition as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The highest acquisition indebtedness with respect to such  property during the 12-month period, preceding the date of disposition,  is of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The average adjusted basis of such property.  The tax on the amount of gain (or loss) included in unrelated business  taxable income pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be determined in  accordance with the rules set forth in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the  Code (relating to capital gains and losses). See also section 511(d) and  the regulations thereunder (relating to the minimum tax for tax  preferences).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Average adjusted basis--(i) In general. The average adjusted  basis of debt-financed property is the average amount of the adjusted  basis of such property during that portion of the taxable year it is  held by the organization. This amount is the average of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The adjusted basis of such property as of the first day during  the taxable year that the organization holds the property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The adjusted basis of such property as of the last day during  the taxable year that the organization holds the property   See section 1011 and the regulations thereunder for determination of the  adjusted basis of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments for prior taxable years. For purposes of  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the determination of the average  adjusted basis of debt-financed property is not affected by the fact  that the organization was exempt from taxation for prior taxable years.  Proper adjustment must be made under section 1011 for the entire period  since the acquisition of the property. For example, adjustment must be  made for depreciation for all prior taxable years whether or not the  organization was exempt from taxation for any such years. Similarly, the  fact that only a portion of the depreciation allowance may be taken into  account in computing the percentage of deductions allowable under  section 514(a)(2) does not affect the amount of the adjustment   for depreciation which is used in determining average adjusted basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cross reference. For the determination of the basis of debt- financed property acquired in a complete or partial liquidation of a  corporation in exchange for its stock, see Sec. 1.514(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following  example. For purposes of this example it is assumed that the property is  debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On July 10, 1970, X, an exempt educational organization,  purchased an office building for $510,000, using $300,000 of borrowed  funds. During 1970 the only adjustment to basis is $20,000 for  depreciation. As of December 31, 1970, the adjusted basis of the  building is $490,000 and the indebtedness is still $300,000. X files its  return on a calendar year basis. Under these circumstances, the debt/ basis percentage for 1970 is 60 percent, calculated in the following  manner:</p><p class="depth0">Basis</p><p class="depth0">As of July 10, 1970 (acquisition date).....................     $510,000 As of December 31, 1970....................................      490,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total..................................................    1,000,000</p><p class="depth0">Average Adjusted basis: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08OC91.000  Debt/basis percentage:  Average acquisition indebtedness ($300,000)/Average adjusted basis</p><p class="depth0"><em>($500,000)</em>=60 percent  For an illustration of the determination of the debt/basis percentage as  changes in the acquisition indebtedness occur, see example 1 of  subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Average acquisition indebtedness--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The average  acquisition indebtedness with respect to debt-financed property is the  average amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness during that  portion of the taxable year the property is held by the organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation. The average acquisition indebtedness is computed  by determining the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness on  the first day in each calendar month during the taxable year that the  organization holds the property, adding these amounts together, and then  dividing this sum by the total number of months during the taxable year  that the organization held such property. A fractional part of a month  shall be treated as a full month in computing average acquisition  indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples it  is assumed that the property is debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume the facts as stated in the example in subparagraph  (2)(iv) of this paragraph, except that beginning July 20, 1970, the  organization makes payments of $21,000 a month ($20,000 of which is  attributable to principal and $1,000 to interest). In this situation,  the average acquisition indebtedness for 1970 is $250,000. Thus, the  debt/basis percentage for 1970 is 50 percent, calculated in the  following manner:</p><p class="depth0">Indebtedness</p><p class="depth0">on the first</p><p class="depth0">day in each</p><p class="depth0">calendar month</p><p class="depth0">that the</p><p class="depth0">property is</p><p class="depth0">held</p><p class="depth0">Month:</p><p class="depth0">July..................................................        $300,000</p><p class="depth0">August................................................         280,000</p><p class="depth0">September.............................................         260,000</p><p class="depth0">October...............................................         240,000</p><p class="depth0">November..............................................         220,000</p><p class="depth0">December..............................................         200,000</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">Total.............................................       1,500,000</p><p class="depth0">Average acquisition indebtedness: $1,500,000/6 months=$250,000  Debt/basis percentage: Average acquisition indebtedness ($250,000)/Average adjusted basis</p><p class="depth0"><em>($500,000)</em>=50 percent</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Y, an exempt organization, owns stock in a corporation  which it does not control. At the beginning of the year, Y has an  outstanding principal indebtedness with respect to such stock of  $12,000.

For purposes of this subparagraph, the  unadjusted basis of property (or of an improvement) is the fair market  value of the property (or improvement) on the date of acquisition (or  the date of completion of the improvement). The average adjusted basis  of such property shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Initial acquisition indebtedness. For purposes of this  subparagraph, the initial acquisition indebtedness is the fair market  value of the property (or improvement) on the date of acquisition (or  the date of completion of the improvement) less any down payment or  other initial payment applied to the principal indebtedness. The average  acquisition indebtednessith respect to such property shall be computed  in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following example. For purposes of this example it is  assumed that the property is debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, 1971, X, an exempt trade association,  acquires an office building for a down payment of $310,000 and an  agreement to pay 10 percent of the income generated by the building for  10 years. Neither the sales price nor the amount which X is obligated to  pay in the future is certain. The fair market value of the building on  the date of acquisition is $600,000. The depreciation allowance for 1971  is $40,000. Unless X obtains the consent of the Commissioner to use  another method, the unadjusted basis of the property is $600,000 (the  fair market value of the property on the date of acquisition), and the  initial acquisition indebtedness is $290,000 (fair market value of  $600,000 less initial payment of $310,000). Under these circumstances,  the average adjusted basis of the property for 1971 is $580,000,  calculated as follows:  [Initial fair market value+(initial fair market value less</p><p class="depth0">depreciation)] /2=[$600,000+($600,000-$40,000)] /2=$580,000.</p><p class="depth0">If no payment other than the initial payment is made in 1971, the  average acquisition indebtedness for 1971 is $290,000. Thus, the debt/ basis percentage for 1971 is 50 percent, calculated as follows:  Average acquisition indebtedness /average adjusted basis=$290,000 /</p><p class="depth0">$580,000=50 percent</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Percentage of deductions taken into account.  Except as provided in subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph, there  shall be allowed as a deduction with respect to each debt-financed  property an amount determined by applying the debt/basis percentage to  the sum of the deductions allowable under subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deductions allowable. The deductions allowable are those items  allowed as deductions by chapter 1 of the Code which are directly  connected with the debt-financed property or the income therefrom  (including the dividends received deductions allowed by sections 243,  244, and 245), except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The allowable deductions are subject to the modifications  provided by section 512(b) on computation of the unrelated business  taxable income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the debt-financed property is of a character which is  subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, such  allowance shall be computed only by use of the straight-line method of  depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Directly connected with. To be directly connected with debt- financed property or the income therefrom, an item of deduction must  have proximate and primary relationship to such property or the income  therefrom. Expenses, depreciation, and similar items attributable solely  to such property are proximately and primarily related to such property  or the income therefrom, and therefore qualify for deduction, to the  extent they meet the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.  Thus, for example, if the straight-line depreciation allowance for an  office building is $10,000 a year, an organization would be allowed a  deduction for depreciation of $10,000 if the entire building were debt- financed property. However, if only one-half of   the building were treated as debt-financed property, then the  depreciation allowed as a deduction would be $5,000. (See example 2 of  Sec. 1.514(b)-1(b)(1)(iii).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Capital losses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the sale or exchange of debt- financed property results in a capital loss, the amount of such loss  taken into account in the taxable year in which the loss arises shall be  computed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section. If,  however, any portion of such capital loss not taken into account in such  year may be carried back or carried over to another taxable year, the  debt/basis percentage is not applied to determine what portion of such  capital loss may be taken as a deduction in the year to which such  capital loss is carried.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example.

Thus, X has sustained a capital  loss of $8,000 (40 percent of $20,000) with respect to the sale of the  securities.

For purposes of the unrelated business  income tax the basis (unadjusted) of property   is determined under section 1012, and the adjusted basis of property is  determined under section 1011. The determination of the adjusted basis  of property is not affected by the fact that the organization was exempt  from tax for prior taxable years. Proper adjustment must be made under  section 1011 for the entire period since the acquisition of the  property. Thus adjustment must be made for depreciation for all taxable  years whether or not the organization was exempt from tax for any of  such years. Similarly, for taxable years during which the organization  is subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income the fact that  only a portion of the deduction for depreciation is taken into account  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not affect the amount of the  adjustment for depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the  taxpayer makes its returns under section 511 on the basis of the  calendar year, and that the lease is not substantially related to the  purpose for which the organization is granted exemption from tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that a tax-exempt educational organization  purchased property in 1952 for $600,000, using borrowed funds, and  leased the building for a period of 20 years. Assume further that the  adjusted basis of such building at the close of 1954 is $500,000 and  that, at the close of 1954, $200,000 of the indebtedness incurred to  acquire the property remains outstanding. Since the amount of the  outstanding indebtedness is two-fifths of the adjusted basis of the  building at the close of 1954, two-fifths of the gross rental received  from the building during 1954 shall be included as an item of gross  income in computing unrelated business taxable income. If, at the close  of a subsequent taxable year, the outstanding indebtedness is $100,000  and the adjusted basis of the building is $400,000, one-fourth of the  gross rental for such taxable year shall be included as an item of gross  income in computing unrelated business taxable income for such taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that a tax-exempt organization owns a four-story  building, that in 1954 it borrows $100,000 which it uses to improve the  whole building, and that it thereafter in 1954 rents the first and  second floors of the building under six-year leases at rentals of $4,000  a year. The third and fourth floors of the building are leased on a  yearly basis during 1954. Assume, also, that the adjusted basis of the  real property at the end of 1954 (after reflecting the expenditures for  improving the building) is $200,000, allocable equally to each of the  four stories. Under these facts, only one-half of the real property is  subject to a business lease since only one-half is rented under a lease  for more than 5 years. See Sec. 1.514(f)-1. The percentage of the rent  under such lease which is taken into account is determined by the ratio  which the allocable part of the business lease indebtedness bears to the  allocable part of the adjusted basis of the real property, that is, the  ratio which one-half of the $100,000 of business lease indebtedness  outstanding at the close of 1954, or $50,000, bears to one-half of the  adjusted basis of the business lease premises at the close of 1954, or  $100,000. The percentage of rent which is business lease income for 1954  is, therefore, one-half (the ratio of $50,000 to $100,000) of $8,000, or  $4,000, and this amount of $4,000 is considered an item of gross income  derived from an unrelated trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deductions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deductions allowable against gross income. The  same percentage is used in determining both the portion of the rent and  the portion of the deductions taken into account with respect to the  business lease in computing unrelated business taxable income. Such  percentage is applicable only to the sum of the following deductions  allowable under section 161:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxes and other expenses paid or accrued during the taxable year  upon or with respect to the real property subject to the business lease;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest paid or accrued during the taxable year on the  business lease indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reasonable allowance for exhaustion, wear and tear  (including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence) of the real property  subject to such lease.

Under the facts set forth in such example 1 and  in this example, the deductions to be taken into account for 1954 in  computing unrelated business taxable income would be two-fifths of the  total of the deductions of $20,000, that is $8,000.

W sells time for the use of the  computer to M corporation on occasions when the computer is not in full- time use by W. W uses the computer in furtherance of its exempt purpose  more than 85 percent of the time it is in use and M uses the computer  less than 15 percent of the total operating time the computer is in use.  In this situation, substantially all the use of the computer is related  to the performance of W's exempt purpose. Therefore, no portion of the  computer is treated as debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X, an exempt college, owns a four story office building  which has been purchased with borrowed funds. In 1971, the lower two  stories of the building are used to house computers which are used by X  for administrative purposes. The top two stories are rented to the  public for purposes not described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or  (D). The gross income derived by X from the building is $6,000, all of  which is attributable to the rents paid by tenants. There are $2,000 of  expenses, allocable equally to each use of the building. The average  adjusted basis of the building for1971 is $100,000, and the outstanding  principal indebtedness throughout 1971 is $60,000. Thus, the average  acquisition indebtedness for 1971 is $60,000. In accordance with  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, only the upper half of the  building is debt-financed property. Consequently, only the rental income  and the deductions directly connected with such income are to be taken  into account in computing unrelated business taxable income. The portion  of such amounts to be taken into account is determined by multiplying  the $6,000 of rental income and $1,000 of deductions directly connected  with such rental income by the debt/basis percentage. The debt/basis  percentage is the ratio which the allocable part of the average  acquisition indebtedness is of the allocable part of the average  adjusted basis of the property, that is, the ratio which $30,000 (one- half of $60,000) bears to $50,000 (one-half of $100,000). Thus, the  debt/basis percentage for 1971 is 60 percent (the ratio of $30,000 to  $50,000). Under these circumstances, X shall include net rental income  of $3,000 in its unrelated business taxable income for 1971, computed as  follows:  Total rental income.........................................      $6,000 Deductions directly connected with rental income............      $1,000 Debt/basis percentage ($30,000/$50,000).....................         60% Rental income treated as gross income from an unrelated           $3,600</p><p class="depth0">trade or business (60 percent of $6,000)...................

Assume the facts as stated in example 2 except that on  December 31, 1971, X sells the building and realizes a long-term capital  gain of $10,000. This is X's only capital transaction for 1971. An  allocable portion of this gain is subject to tax. This amount is  determined by multiplying the gain related to the nonexempt use, $5,000  (one-half of $10,000), by the ratio which the debtedness for the 12- month period preceding the date of sale, $30,000 (one-half of $60,000),  is of the allocable part of the average adjusted basis, $50,000 (one- half of $100,000). Thus, the debt/basis percentage with respect to  computing the gain (or loss) derived from the sale of the building is 60  percent (the ratio of $30,000 to $50,000). Consequently, $3,000 (60  percent of $5,000) is a net section 1201 gain (capital gain net income  for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976). The portion of  such gain which is taxable shall be determined in accordance with rules  contained in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to capital  gains and losses).

See paragraph (1)(5) of Sec. 1.512(b)-1 for the rules  determining the manner in which amounts are taken into account where  such amounts may be included in the computation of unrelated business  taxable income by operation of more than one provision of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. Subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples it  is assumed that the indebtedness is acquisition indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, an exempt scientific organization, owns a 10-story  office building. During 1972, four stories are occupied by X's  administrative offices, and the remaining six stories are rented to the  public for purposes not described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or  (D). On December 31, 1972, the building is sold and X realizes a long- term capital gain of $100,000. This is X's only capital transaction for  1972. The debt/basis percentage with respect to computing the gain (or  loss) derived from the sale of the building is 30 percent. Since 40  percent of the building was used for X's exempt purpose, only 60 percent  of the building is debt-financed property. Thus, only $60,000 of the  gain (60 percent of $100,000) is subject to this section. Consequently,  the amount of gain treated as unrelated debt-financed income is $18,000  ($60,000 multiplied by the debt/basis percentage of 30 percent). The  portion of such $18,000 which is taxable shall be determined in  accordance with the rules contained in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the  Code. See also section 511(d) and the regulations thereunder (relating  to the minimum tax for tax preferences).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Y, an exempt organization, owns two properties, a  restaurant and an office building. In 1972, all the space in the office  building, except for the portion utilized by Y to house the  administrative offices of the restaurant, is rented to the public for  purposes not described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). The  average adjusted basis of the office building for 1972 is $2 million.  The outstanding principal indebtedness throughout 1972 is $1 million.  Thus, the highest acquisition indebtedness in the calendar year of 1972  is $1 million. It is determined that 30 percent of the space in the  office building is used for the administrative functions engaged in by  the employees of the organization with respect to the restaurant. Since  the income attributable to the restaurant is attributable to the conduct  of an unrelated trade or business, only 70 percent of the building is  treated as debt-financed property for purposes of determining the  portion of the rental income which is unrelated debt-financed income. On  December 31, 1972, the office building is sold and Y realizes a long- term capital gain of $250,000. This is Y's only capital transaction for  1972. In accordance with subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, all the  gain derived from this sale is taken into account in computing the  amount of such gain subject to tax. The portion of such gain which is  taxable is determined by multiplying the $250,000 gain by the debt/basis  percentage. The debt/basis percentage is the ratio which the highest  acquisition indebtedness for the 12-month period preceding the date of  sale, $1 million, is of the averageadjusted basis, $2 million. Thus, the  debt/basis percentage with respect to computing the gain (or loss)  derived from the sale of the building is 50 percent (the ratio of $1  million to $2 million). Consequently, $125,000 (50 percent of $250,000)  is a net section 1201 gain (net capital gain for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1976). The amount of such gain which is taxable shall  be determined in accordance with the rules contained in subchapter P,  chapter 1 of the Code. See also section 511(d) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Z, an exempt university, owns all the stock of M, a  nonexempt corporation.

During 1971, M has $500,000 of taxable income,  disregarding the rent paid to Z: $150,000 from the dormitory and  $350,000 from the factory. The factory is subject to a mortgage of  $150,000. Its average adjusted basis for 1971 is determined to be  $300,000. Z's deductions for 1971 with respect to the leased property  are $4,000 for the dormitory and $16,000 for the factory. In accordance  with subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, section 514 applies only to  that portion of the rent which is excluded from the computation of  unrelated business taxable income by operation of section 512(b)(3) and  not included in such computation pursuant to section 512(b)(13). Since  all the rent received by Z is derived from real property, section  512(b)(3) would exclude all such rent from computation of Z's unrelated  business taxable income. However, 70 percent of the rent paid to Z with  respect to the factory and 70 percent of the deductions directly  connected with such rent shall be taken into account by Z in determining  its unrelated business taxable income pursuant to section 512(b)(15),  computed as follows:  M's taxable income (disregarding rent paid to Z)............    $500,000 Less taxable income from dormitory..........................    $150,000</p><p class="depth0">----------- Excess taxable income.......................................    $350,000 Ratio ($350,000/$500,000)...................................      \7/10\ Total rent paid to Z........................................    $100,000 Total deductions ($4,000+$16,000)...........................     $20,000 Rental income treated under section 512(b)(15) as gross          $70,000</p><p class="depth0">income from an unrelated trade or business (\7/10\ of</p><p class="depth0">$100,000)..................................................

The portion of such amounts to be  taken into account is determined by multiplying the $10,000 of income  and $2,000 of deductions by the debt/basis percentage. The debt/basis  percentage is the ratio which the average acquisition indebtedness  ($150,000) is of the average adjusted basis of the property ($300,000).

The title to such building is held by  N, an exempt holding company described in section 501(c)(2), which  acquired title to the building with borrowed funds. The other 30 percent  of the space in this office building is leased to L, a nonstock exempt  trade association described in section 501(c)(6). L uses such office  space in furtherance of its exemptpurpose. The members of L's Board of  Trustees serves for fixed terms and M's Board of Directors has the power  to select all such members. N pays over to M all the profits it derives  from the leasing of space in this building to M and L. Accordingly, M is  related to N (as such term is defined in subdivision (ii)(a) of this  subparagraph) and L is related to M (as such term is defined in  subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph). Under these circumstances,  since all the available space in the building is leased to either an  exempt organization related to the exempt organization holding title to  the building or an exempt organization related to such related exempt  organization, no portion of the building is treated as debt-financed  property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. W, an exempt labor union described in section 501(c)(5),  owns a 10-story office building which has been purchased with borrowed  funds. Five floors of the building are used by W in furtherance of its  exempt purpose. Four of the other floors are rented to X which is an  exempt voluntary employees' beneficiary association described in section  501(c)(9), operated for the benefit of W's members. X uses such office  space in furtherance of its exempt purpose. Seventy percent of the  members of W are also members of X. Accordingly, X is related to W (as  such term is defined in subdivision (ii)(c) of this subparagraph). The  remaining floor of the building is rented to the general public for  purposes not described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). Under  thesecircumstances, no portion of this building is treated as debt- financed property since more than 85 percent of the office space  available in this building is used either by W or X, an exempt  organization related to W, in furtherance of their respective exempt  purpose. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for rules relating to the  use of property substantially related to an exempt purpose. See  paragraph (b)(6) of this section for rules relating to uses by related  exempt organizations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that W and  X are each exempt local labor unions described in section 501(c)(5)  having no common membership and are each affiliated with N, an exempt  international labor union described in section 501(c)(5). Under these  circumstances, no portion of this building is treated as debt-financed  property since more than 85 percent of the office space available in  this building is used either by W or X, an exempt organization related  to W, in furtherance of their respective exempt purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that W and  X are directly affiliated with different exempt international labor  unions and that W and X are not otherwise affiliated with, or members  of, a common exempt organization, other than an association of  international labor unions. Under these circumstances, the portions of  this building which are rented to X and to the general public are  treated as debt-financed property since X is not related to W and W uses  less than 85 percent of the building for its exempt purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Life income contracts. (i) Property shall not be treated as  debt-financed property when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An individual transfers property to a trust or a fund subject to  a contract providing that the income is to be paid to him or other  individuals or both for a period of time not to exceed the life of such  individual or individuals in a transaction in which the payments to the  individual or individuals do not constitute the proceeds of a sale or  exchange of the property so transferred, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The remainder interest is payable to an exempt organization  described in section 501(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is illustrated by the  following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, 1967, A transfers property to X, an exempt  organization described in section 501(c)(3), which immediately places  the property in a fund. On January 1, 1971, A transfers additional  property to X, which property is also placed in the fund. In exchange  for each transfer, A receives income participation fund certificates  which entitle him to a proportionate part of the fund's income for his  life and for the life of another individual. None of the payments made  by X are treated by the recipients as the proceeds of a sale or exchange  of the property transferred. In this situation, none of the property  received by X from A is treated as debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Property acquired for prospective exempt use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Neighborhood  land--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If an organization acquires real property for the  principal purpose of using the land in the exercise or performance of  its exempt purpose, commencing within 10 years of the time of  acquisition, such property will not be treated as debt-financed  property, so long as (a) such property is in the neighborhood of other  property owned by the organization which is used in the performance of  its exempt purpose, and (b) the organization does not abandon its intent  to use the land in such a manner within the 10-year period. The rule  expressed in this subdivision is hereinafter referred to as the  neighborhood land rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Neighborhood defined. Property shall be considered in the  neighborhood of property owned and used by the organization in the  performance of its exempt purpose if the acquired property is contiguous  with the exempt purpose property or would be contiguous with such  property except for the interposition of a road, street, railroad,  stream, or similar property. If the acquired property is not contiguous  with exempt function property, it may still be in the neighborhood of  such property, but only if it is within 1 mile of such property and the  facts and circumstances of the particular situation make the acquisition  of contiguous property unreasonable. Some of the criteria to consider in  determining this question include the availability of land and the  intended future use of the land. For example, a university attempts to  purchase land contiguous to its present campus but cannot do so because  the owners either refuse to sell or ask unreasonable prices. The nearest  land of sufficient size and utility is a block away from the campus. The  university purchases such land. Under these circumstances, the  contiguity requirement is unreasonable and the land purchased would be  considered neighborhood land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception. The neighborhood land rule shall not apply to any  property after the expiration of 10 years from the date of acquisition.  Further, the neighborhood land rule shall apply after the first 5 years  of the 10-year period only if the organization establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner that future use of the acquired land in  furtherance of the organization's exempt purpose before the expiration  of the 10-year period is reasonably certain. In order to satisfy the  Commissioner, the organization does not necessarily have to show binding  contracts. However, it must at least have a definite plan detailing a  specific improvement and a completion date, and some affirmative action  toward the fulfillment of such a plan. This information shall be  forwarded to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224,  for a ruling at least 90 days before the end of the fifth year after  acquisition of the land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actual use. If the neighborhood land rule is inapplicable  because:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The acquired land is not in the neighborhood of other property  used by the organization in performance of its exempt purpose, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The organization (for the period after the first 5 years of the  10-year period) is unable to establish to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner that the use of the acquired land for its exempt purposes  within the 10-year period is reasonably certain   but the land is actually used by the organization in furtherance of its  exempt purpose within the 10-year period, such property (subject to the  provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) shall not be treated  as debt-financed property for any period prior to such conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations--(i) Demolition or removal required. (a)  Subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph shall apply with respect to  any structure on the land when acquired by the organization, or to the  land occupied by the structure, only so long as the intended future use  of the land in furtherance of the organization's exempt purpose requires  that the structure be demolished or removed in order to use the land in  such a manner. Thus, during the first 5 years after acquisition (and for  subsequent years if there is a favorable ruling in accordance with  subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph) improved property is not debt- financed so long as the organization does not abandon its intent to  demolish the existing structures and use the land in furtherance of   its exempt purpose. Furthermore, if there is an actual demolition of  such structures, the use made of the land need not be the one originally  intended. Therefore, the actual use requirement of this subdivision may  be satisfied by using the land in any manner which furthers the exempt  purpose of the organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by  the following examples. For purposes of the following examples it is  assumed that but for the application of the neighborhood land rule such  property would be debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An exempt university acquires a contiguous tract of land  on which there is an apartment building. The university intends to  demolish the apartment building and build classrooms and does not  abandon this intent during the first 4 years after acquisition. In the  fifth year after acquisition it abandons the intent to demolish and  sells the apartment building. Under these circumstances, such property  is not debt-financed property for the first 4 years after acquisition  even though there was no eventual demolition or use made of such land in  furtherance of the university's exempt purpose. However, such property  is debt-financed property as of the time in the fifth year that the  intent to demolish the building is abandoned and any gain on the sale of  property is subject to section 514.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in Example 1 except that the  university did not abandon its intent to demolish the existing building  and construct a classroom building until the eighth year after  acquisition when it sells the property. Assume further that the  university did not receive a favorable ruling in accordance with  subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph. Under these circumstances, the  building is debt- financed property for the sixth, seventh, and eighth  years. It is not, however, treated as debt-financed property for the  first 5 years after acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the facts as stated in Example 2 except that the  university received a favorable ruling in accordance with subparagraph  (1)(iii) of this paragraph. Under these circumstances, the building is  not debt-financed property for the first 7 years after acquisition. It  only becomes debt-financed property as of the time in the eighth year  when the university abandoned its intent to demolish the existing  structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this paragraph). In the ninth taxable year  after acquisition the university converts the office building into an  administration building. Under these circumstances, during the sixth,  seventh, and eighth years after acquisition, the office building is  treated as debt-financed property because the office building was not  demolished or removed. Therefore, the income derived from such property  during these years shall be subject to the tax on unrelated business  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assume that instead of converting the office building to an  administration building, the university demolishes the office building  in the ninth taxable year after acquisition and then constructs a new  administration building. Under these circumstances, the land would not  be considered debt-financed property for any period following the  acquisition, and the university would be entitled to a refund of taxes  paid on the income derived from such property for the sixth through  eighth taxable years after the acquisition in accordance with  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent construction. Subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this  paragraph do not apply to structures erected on the land after the  acquisition of the land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Property subject to business lease. Subparagraphs (1) and (2)  of this paragraph do not apply to property subject to a lease which is a  business lease (as defined in Sec. 1.514(f)-1) whether the organization  acquired the property subject to the lease or whether it executed the  lease subsequent to acquisition. If only a portion of the real property  is subject to a lease, paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.514(f)-1 applies in  determining whether such lease is a business lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Refund of taxes. (i) If an organization has not satisfied the  actual use condition of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or paragraph  (e)(3) of this section before the date prescribed by law (including  extensions) for filing the return for the taxable year, the tax for such  year shall be computed without regard to the application of such actual  use condition. However, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A credit or refund of any overpayment of taxes is allowable for  a prior taxable year as a result of the satisfaction of such actual use  condition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of the Act of  January 3, 1975 (Pub. L. 93-625, 88 Stat. 2115).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example.  For purposes of this example it is assumed that but for the neighborhood  land rule such property would be debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Y, a calendar year exempt organization, acquires real  property in January 1970, which is contiguous with other property used  by Y in furtherance of its exempt purpose. However, Y does not satisfy  the Commissioner by January 1975, that the existing structure will be  demolished and the land will be used in furtherance of its exempt  purpose. In accordance with this subparagraph, from 1975 until the  property is converted to an exempt use, the income derived from such  property shall be subject to the tax on unrelated business income.  During July 1979, Y demolishes the existing structure on the land and  begins using the land in furtherance of its exempt purpose. At this time  Y may file claims for refund for the open years 1976 through 1978.  Further, in accordance with this subparagraph, Y may also file a claim  for refund for 1975, even though a claim for such taxable year may be  barred by the statute of limitations, provided such claim is filed  before the close of 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Churches--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a church or association or  convention of churches acquires real property, for the principal purpose  of using the land in the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose,  commencing within 15 years of the time of acquisition, such property  shall not be treated as debt-financed property so long as the  organization does not abandon its intent to use the land in such a  manner within the 15-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. This paragraph shall not apply to any property after  the expiration of the 15-year period.

For purposes of the preceding sentence,  the rules contained in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section with  respect to satisfying the Commissioner that the exempt organization  intends to use the land within the prescribed time in furtherance of its  exempt purpose shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Actual use. If the church or association or convention of  churches for the period after the first 5 years of the 15-year period is  unable to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the use  of the acquired land for its exempt purpose within the 15-year period is  reasonably certain, but such land is in fact converted to an exempt use  within the 15-year period, the land (subject to the provisions of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section) shall not be treated as debt-financed  property for any period prior to such conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations.

For  purposes of section 514 and the regulations thereunder, the term  acquisition indebtedness means, with respect to any debt-financed  property, the outstanding amount of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The principal indebtedness incurred by the organization in  acquiring or improving such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The principal indebtedness incurred before the acquisition or  improvement of such property if such indebtedness would not have been  incurred but for such acquisition or improvement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The principal indebtedness incurred after the acquisition or  improvement of such property if such indebtedness would not have been  incurred but for such acquisition or improvement and the incurrence of  such indebtedness was reasonably foreseeable at the time of such  acquisition or improvement   Whether the incurrence of an indebtedness is reasonably foreseeable  depends upon the facts and circumstances of each situation. The fact  that an organization did not actually foresee the need for the  incurrence of an indebtedness prior to the acquisition or improvement  does not necessarily mean that the subsequent incurrence of indebtedness  was not reasonably foreseeable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, an exempt organization, pledges some of its investment  securities with a bank for a loan and uses the proceeds of such loan to  purchase an office building which it leases to the public for purposes  other than those described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D).  The outstanding principal indebtedness with respect to the loan  constitutes acquisition indebtedness incurred prior to the acquisition  which would not have been incurred but for such acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Y, an exempt scientific organization, mortgages its  laboratory to replace working capital used in remodeling an office  building which Y rents to an insurance company for purposes not  described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). The indebtedness  is acquisition indebtedness since such indebtedness, though incurred  subsequent to the improvement of the office building, would not have  been incurred but for such improvement, and the indebtedness was  reasonably foreseeable when, to make such improvement, Y reduced its  working capital below the amount necessary to continue current  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> U, an exempt private preparatory school, as its sole  educational facility owns a classroom building which no longer meets the  needs of U's students. In 1971, U sells this building for $3 million to  Y, a corporation which it does not control. U receives $1 million as a  down payment from Y and takes back a purchase money mortgage of $2  million which bears interest at 10 percent per annum. At the time U  became the mortgagee of the $2 million purchase money mortgage, U  realized that it would have to construct a new classroom building and  knew that it would have to incur an indebtedness in the construction of  the new classroom building. In 1972, U builds a new classroom building  for a cost of $4 million. In connection with the construction of this  building, U borrows $2.5 million from X Bank pursuant to a deed of trust  bearing interest at 6 percent perannum. Under these circumstances, $2  million of the $2.5 million borrowed to finance construction of the new  classroom building would not have been borrowed but for the retention of  the $2 million purchase money mortgage. Since such indebtedness was  reasonably foreseeable, $2 million of the $2.5 million borrowed to  finance the construction of the new classroom building is acquisition  indebtedness with respect to the purchase money mortgage and the  purchase money mortgage is debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In 1972, U receives $200,000 in interest from Y (10 percent of  $2 million) and makes a $150,000 interest payment to X (6 percent of  $2.5 million). In addition, assume that for 1972 the debt/basis  percentage is 100 percent ($2 million/$2 million). Accordingly, all the  interest and all the deductions directly connected with such interest  income are to be taken into account in computing unrelated business  taxable income. Thus, $200,000 of interest income and $120,000  ($150,000x$2 million/$2.5 million) of deductions directly connected with  such interest income are taken into account. Under these circumstances,  U shall include net interest income of $80,000 ($200,000 of income less  $120,000 of deductions directly connected with such income) in its  unrelated business taxable income for 1972.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 1972 X, an exempt organization, forms a partnership  with A and B. The partnership agreement provides that all three partners  shall share equally in the profits of the partnership, shall each invest  $3 million, and that X shall be a limited partner. X invests $1 million  of its own funds in the partnership and $2 million of borrowed funds.  The partnership purchases as its sole asset an office building which is  leased to the general public for purposes other than those described in  section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). The office building cost the  partnership $24 million of which $15 million is borrowed from Y bank.  This loan is secured by a mortgage on the entire office building. By  agreement with Y bank, X is held not to be personally liable for payment  of such mortgage. By reason of section 702(b) the character of any item  realized by the partnership and included in the partner's distributive  share shall be determined as if the partner realized such item directly  from the source from which it was realized by the partnership and in the  same manner. Therefore, a portion of X's income from the building is  debt-financed income. Under these circumstances,   since both the $2 million indebtedness incurred by X in acquiring its  partnership interest and $5 million, the allocable portion of the  partnership'sindebtedness incurred with respect to acquiring the office  building which is attributable to X in computing the debt/basis  percentage (one-third of $15 million), were incurred in acquiring  income-producing property, X has acquisition indebtedness of $7 million  ($2 million plus $5 million). Similarly, the allocable portion of the  partnership's adjusted basis in the office building which is  attributable to X in computing the debt-basis percentage is $8 million  (one-third of $24 million). Assuming no payment with respect to either  indebtedness and no adjustments to basis in 1972, X's average  acquisition indebtedness is $7 million and X's average adjusted basis is  $8 million for such year. Therefore, X's debt/basis percentage with  respect to its share of the partnership income for 1972 is 87.5 percent  ($7 million/$8 million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes in use of property. Since property used in a manner  described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D) is not considered  debt-financed property, indebtedness with respect to such property is  not acquisition indebtedness. However, if an organization converts such  property to a use which is not described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B),  (C), or (D) and such property is otherwise treated as debt-financed  property, the outstanding principal indebtedness with respect to such  property will thereafter be treated as acquisition indebtedness. For  example, assume that in 1971 a university borrows funds to acquire an  apartment building as housing for married students. In 1974 the  university rents the apartment building to the public for purposes not  described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). The outstanding  principal indebtedness is acquisition indebtedness as of the time in  1974 when the building is first rented to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continued indebtedness. If:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An organization sells or exchanges property, subject to an  indebtedness (incurred in a manner described in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquires another property without retiring the indebtedness,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The newly acquired property is otherwise treated as debt- financed property   the outstanding principal indebtedness with respect to the acquired  property is acquisition indebtedness, even though the original property  was not debt-financed property. For example, to house its administrative  offices, an exempt organization purchases a building with $600,000 of  its own funds and $400,000 of borrowed funds secured by a pledge of its  securities. It later sells the building for $1,000,000 without redeeming  the pledge. It uses these proceeds to purchase an apartment building  which it rents to the public for purposes not described in section  514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D). The indebtedness of $400,000 is  acquisition indebtedness with respect to the apartment building even  though the office building was not debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Indebtedness incurred before June 28, 1966. For taxable years  beginning before January 1, 1972, acquisition indebtedness does not  include any indebtedness incurred before June 28, 1966, unless such  indebtedness was incurred on rental real property subject to a business  lease and such indebtedness constituted business lease indebtedness.  Furthermore, in the case of a church or convention or association of  churches, the preceding sentence applies without regard to whether the  indebtedness incurred before June 28, 1966, constituted business lease  indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Property acquired subject to lien--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mortgages. Except as  provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, whenever  property is acquired subject to a mortgage, the amount of the  outstanding principal indebtedness secured by such mortgage is treated  as acquisition indebtedness with respect to such property even though  the organization did not assume or agree to pay such indebtedness. The  preceding sentence applies whether property is acquired by purchase,  gift, devise, bequest, or any other means. Thus, for example, assume  that an exempt organization pays $50,000 for real property valued at  $150,000 and subject to a $100,000 mortgage. The $100,000 of outstanding  principal indebtedness is acquisition indebtedness just as though the  organization had borrowed $100,000 to buy the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other liens. For purposes of this paragraph, liens similar to  mortgages shall be treated as mortgages. A lien is similar to a mortgage  if title to property is encumbered by the lien for the   benefit of a creditor. However, in the case where State law provides  that a tax lien attaches to property prior to the time when such lien  becomes due and payable, such lien shall not be treated as similar to a  mortgage until after it has become due and payable and the organization  has had an opportunity to pay such lien in accordance with State law.  Liens similar to mortgages include (but are not limited to):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deeds of trust,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditional sales contracts,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Chattel mortgages,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pledges,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Agreements to hold title in escrow, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Tax liens (other than those described in the third sentence of  this subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain encumbered property acquired by gift, bequest or  devise--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bequest or devise. Where property subject to a mortgage is  acquired by an organization by bequest or devise, the outstanding  principal indebtedness secured by such mortgage is not to be treated as  acquisition indebtedness during the 10-year period following the date of  acquisition. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the date of  acquisition is the date the organization receives the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gifts. If an organization acquires property by gift subject to  a mortgage, the outstanding principal indebtedness secured by such  mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during the 10- year period following the date of such gift, so long as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The mortgage was placed on the property more than 5 years before  the date of the gift, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The property was held by the donor for more than 5 years before  the date of the gift   For purposes of the preceding sentence, the date of the gift is the date  the organization receives the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitation. Subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph  shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The organization assumes and agrees to pay all or any part of  the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The organization makes any payment for the equity owned by the  decedent or the donor in the property (other than a payment pursuant to  an annuity excluded from the definition of acquisition indebtedness by  paragraph (e) of this section)   Whether an organization has assumed and agreed to pay all or any part of  an indebtedness in order to acquire the property shall be determined by  the facts and circumstances of each situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A dies on January 1, 1971. His will devises an office  building subject to a mortgage to U, an exempt organization described in  section 501(c)(3). U does not at any time assume the mortgage. For the  period 1971 through 1980, the outstanding principal indebtedness secured  by the mortgage is not acquisition indebtedness. However, after December  31, 1980, the outstanding principal indebtedness secured by the mortgage  is acquisition indebtedness if the building is otherwise treated as  debt-financed property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in example 1 except that on  January 1, 1975, U assumes the mortgage. After January 1, 1975, the  outstanding principal indebtedness secured by the mortgage is  acquisition indebtedness if the building is otherwise treated as debt- financed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bargain sale before October 9, 1969. Where property subject to a  mortgage is acquired by an organization before October 9, 1969, the  outstanding principal indebtedness secured by such mortgage is not to be  treated as acquisition indebtedness during the 10-year period following  the date of acquisition if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The mortgage was placed on the property more than 5 years before  the purchase, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The organization paid the seller a total amount no greater than  the amount of the seller's cost (including attorney's fees) directly  related to the transfer of such property to the organization, but in any  event no more than 10 percent of the value of the seller's equity in the  property transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Extension of obligations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An extension, renewal,  or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a preexisting indebtedness is  considered   as a continuation of the old indebtedness to the extent the outstanding  principal amount thereof is not increased. Where the principal amount of  the modified obligation exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the  preexisting indebtedness, the excess shall be treated as a separate  indebtedness for purposes of section 514 and the regulations thereunder.  For example, if the interest rate on an obligation incurred prior to  June 28, 1966, by an exempt university is modified subsequent to such  date, the modified obligation shall be deemed to have been incurred  prior to June 28, 1966. Thus, such an indebtedness will not be treated  as acquisition indebtedness for taxable years beginning before January  1, 1972, unless the original indebtedness was business lease  indebtedness (as defined in Sec. 1.514(g)-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extension or renewal. In general, any modification or  substitution of the terms of an obligation by the organization shall be  an extension or renewal of the original obligation, rather than the  creation of a new indebtedness to the extent that the outstanding  principal amount of the indebtedness is not increased. The following are  examples of acts which result in the extension or renewal of an  obligation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substitution of liens to secure the obligation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substitution of obligees, whether or not with the consent of  the organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Renewal, extension or acceleration of the payment terms of the  obligation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Addition, deletion, or substitution of sureties or other  primary or secondary obligors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation. In cases where the outstanding principal amount of  the modified obligation exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the  unmodified obligation and only a portion of such refinanced indebtedness  is to be treated as acquisition indebtedness, payments on the amount of  the refinanced indebtedness shall be apportioned prorata between the  amount of the preexisting indebtedness and the excess amount. For  example, assume that an organization has an outstanding principal  indebtedness of $500,000 which is treated as acquisition indebtedness.  It borrows another $100,000, which is not acquisition indebtedness, from  the same lending institution and gives the lender a $600,000 note for  its total obligation. In this situation, a payment of $60,000 on the  amount of the total obligation would reduce the acquisition indebtedness  by $50,000 and the excess indebtedness by $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Indebtedness incurred in performing exempt purpose. Acquisition  indebtedness does not include the incurrence of an indebtedness inherent  in the performance or exercise of the purpose or function constituting  the basis of the organization's exemption. Thus, acquisition  indebtedness does not include the indebtedness incurred by an exempt  credit union in accepting deposits from its members or the obligation  incurred by an exempt organization in accepting payments from its  members to provide such members with insurance, retirement or other  similar benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annuities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements. The obligation to make payment of  an annuity is not acquisition indebtedness if the annuity meets all the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It must be the sole consideration (other than a mortgage to  which paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies) issued in exchange for  the property acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the exchange, the present value of the annuity  (determined in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) must  be less than 90 percent of the value of the prior owner's equity in the  property received in the exchange;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The annuity must be payable over the life of one individual in  being at the time the annuity is issued, or over the lives of two  individuals in being at such time; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The annuity must be payable under a contract which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Does not guarantee a minimum number of payments or specify a  maximum number of payments, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Does not provide for any adjustment of the amount of the annuity  payments by reference to the income received from the transferred  property or any other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, and  section 3 of Rev. Rul. 62-216, C.B. 1962-2, 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples. For purposes of these examples it is assumed  that the property transferred is used for purposes other than those  described in section 514(b)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 1971, X, an exempt organization, receives  property valued at $100,000 from donor A, a male aged 60. In return X  promises to pay A $6,000 a year for the rest of A's life, with neither a  minimum nor maximum number of payments specified. The annuity is payble  on December 31, of each year. The amounts paid under the annuity are not  dependent on the income derived from the property transferred to X. The  present value of this annuity is $81,156, determined in accordance with  Table A of Rev. Rul. 62-216. Since the value of the annuity is less than  90 percent of A's equity in the property transferred and the annuity  meets all the other requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph,  the obligation to make annuity payments is not acquisition indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1971, B transfers an office building to Y,  an exempt university, subject to a mortgage. In return Y agrees to pay B  $5,000 a year for the rest of his life, with neither a minimum nor  maximum number of payments specified. The amounts paid under the annuity  are not dependent on the income derived from the property transferred to  Y. It is determined that the actual value of the annuity is less than 90  percent of the value of B's equity in the property transferred. Y does  not assume the mortgage. For the taxable years 1971 through 1980, the  outstanding principal indebtedness secured by the mortgage is not  treated as acquisition indebtedness. Further, Y's obligation to make  annuity payments to B never constitutes acquisition indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain Federal financing. Acquisition indebtedness does not  include an obligation to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, or  construction of housing for low and moderate income persons to the  extent that it is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Thus,  for example, to the extent that an obligation is insured by the Federal  Housing Administration under section 221(d)(3) (12 U.S.C. 1715(I)(d)(3))  or section 236 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-1) of title II of the National Housing  Act, as amended, the obligation is not acquisition indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Certain obligations of charitable remainder trusts. For purposes  of section 664(c) and Sec. 1.664-1(c), a charitable remainder trust (as  defined in Sec. 1.664-1(a)(1)(iii)(a) does not incur acquisition  indebtedness when the sole consideration it is required to pay in  exchange for unencumbered property is an annuity amount or a unitrust  amount (as defined in Sec. 1.664-1(a)(1)(iii)(b) and (c)).

This Sec. 1.514(c)-2  provides rules governing the application of section 514(c)(9)(E). To  comply with section 514(c)(9)(E), the following two requirements must be  met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fractions rule. The allocation of items to a partner that is  a qualified organization cannot result in that partner having a  percentage share of overall partnership income for any partnership  taxable year greater than that partner's fractions rule percentage (as  defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial economic effect. Each partnership allocation must  have substantial economic effect. However, allocations that cannot have  economic effect must be deemed to be in accordance with the partners'  interests in the partnership pursuant to Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4), or (if  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4) does not provide a method for deeming the allocations  to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership)  must otherwise comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4).  Allocations attributable to nonrecourse liabilities or partner  nonrecourse debt must comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.704-2(e) or  Sec. 1.704-2(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner in which fractions rule is applied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  partnership must satisfy the fractions rule both on a prospective basis  and on an actual basis for each taxable year of the partnership,  commencing with the first taxable year of the partnership in which the  partnership holds debt-financed real property and has a qualified  organization as a partner. Generally, a partnership does not qualify for  the unrelated business income tax exception provided by section  514(c)(9)(A) for any taxable year of its existence unless it satisfies  the fractions rule for every year the fractions rule applies. However,  if an actual allocation described in paragraph (e)(4), (h), (j)(2), or  (m)(1)(ii) of this section (regarding certain allocations that are  disregarded or not taken into account for purposes of the fractions rule  until an actual allocation is made) causes the partnership to violate  the fractions rule, the partnership ordinarily is treated as violating  the fractions rule only for the taxable year of the actual allocation  and subsequent taxable years. For purposes of applying the fractions  rule, the term partnership agreement is defined in accordance with  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h), and informal understandings are considered  part of the partnership agreement in appropriate circumstances. See  paragraph (k) of this section for rules relating to changes in the  partners' interests and de minimis exceptions to the fractions rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent changes. A subsequent change to a partnership  agreement that causes the partnership to violate   the fractions rule ordinarily causes the partnership's income to fail  the exception provided by section 514(c)(9)(A) only for the taxable year  of the change and subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overall partnership income and loss.  Overall partnership income is the amount by which the aggregate items of  partnership income and gain for the taxable year exceed the aggregate  items of partnership loss and deduction for the year. Overall  partnership loss is the amount by which the aggregate items of  partnership loss and deduction for the taxable year exceed the aggregate  items of partnership income and gain for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items taken into account in determining overall partnership  income and loss. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the  partnership items that are included in computing overall partnership  income or loss are those items of income, gain, loss, and deduction  (including expenditures described in section 705(a)(2)(B)) that increase  or decrease the partners' capital accounts under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).  Tax items allocable pursuant to section 704(c) or Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(4) are not included in computing overall partnership  income or loss. Nonetheless, allocations pursuant to section 704(c) or  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(4) may be relevant in determining that this  section is being applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the  fractions rule. See paragraph (k)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guaranteed payments to qualified organizations. Except to the  extent otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A guaranteed payment to a qualified organization is not treated  as an item of partnership loss or deduction in computing overall  partnership income or loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Income that a qualified organization may receive or accrue with  respect to a guaranteed payment is treated as an allocable share of  overall partnership income or loss for purposes of the fractions rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fractions rule percentage. A qualified organization's fractions  rule percentage is that partner's percentage share of overall  partnership loss for the partnership taxable year for which that  partner's percentage share of overall partnership loss will be the  smallest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions of certain terms by cross reference to partnership  regulations. Minimum gain chargeback, nonrecourse deduction, nonrecourse  liability, partner nonrecourse debt, partner nonrecourse debt minimum  gain, partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback, partner  nonrecourse deduction, and partnership minimum gain have the meanings  provided in Sec. 1.704-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable corporation TP and qualified organization QO  form a partnership to own and operate encumbered real property. Under  the partnership agreement, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction,  and credit are allocated 50 percent to TP and 50 percent to QO. Neither  partner is entitled to a preferred return. However, the partnership  agreement provides for a $900 guaranteed payment for services to QO in  each of the partnership's first two taxable years. No part of the  guaranteed payments qualify as a reasonable guaranteed payment under  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>  of this section. Therefore, QO's allocable share of the overall  partnership income for the year would be $3,450, whichwould be comprised  of the $900 of income pertaining to QO's guaranteed payment, plus QO's  $2,550 allocable share of the partnership's net income for the year (50  percent of $5,100). QO's $3,450 allocable share of overall partnership  income would equal 58 percent of the $6,000 of   overall partnership income and would exceed QO's fractions rule  percentage, which is less than 50 percent. (If there were no guaranteed  payment, QO's fractions rule percentage would be 50 percent. However,  the existence of the guaranteed payment to QO that is not disregarded  for purposes of the fractions rule pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section means that QO's fractions rule percentage is less than 50  percent.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exclusion of reasonable preferred returns and guaranteed  payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview. This paragraph (d) sets forth requirements for  disregarding reasonable preferred returns for capital and reasonable  guaranteed payments for capital or services for purposes of the  fractions rule. To qualify, the preferred return or guaranteed payment  must be set forth in a binding, written partnership agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preferred returns. Items of income (including gross income) and  gain that may be allocated to a partner with respect to a current or  cumulative reasonable preferred return for capital (including  allocations of minimum gain attributable to nonrecourse liability (or  partner nonrecourse debt) proceeds distributed to the partner as a  reasonable preferred return) are disregarded in computing overall  partnership income or loss for purposes of the fractions rule.  Similarly, if a partnership agreement effects a reasonable preferred  return with an allocation of what would otherwise be overall partnership  income, those items comprising that allocation are disregarded in  computing overall partnership income for purposes of the fractions rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Guaranteed payments. A current or cumulative reasonable  guaranteed payment to a qualified organization for capital or services  is treated as an item of deduction in computing overall partnership  income or loss, and the income that the qualified organization may  receive or accrue from the current or cumulative reasonable guaranteed  payment is not treated as an allocable share of overall partnership  income or loss. The treatment of a guaranteed payment as reasonable for  purposes of section 514(c)(9)(E) does not affect its possible  characterization as unrelated business taxable income under other  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A guaranteed payment for  services is reasonable only to the extent the amount of the payment is  reasonable under Sec. 1.162-7 (relating to the deduction of compensation  for personal services). A preferred return or guaranteed payment for  capital is reasonable only to the extent it is computed, with respect to  unreturned capital, at a rate that is commercially reasonable based on  the relevant facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a rate is  deemed to be commercially reasonable if it is no greater than four  percentage points more than, or if it is no greater than 150 percent of,  the highest long-term applicable federal rate (AFR) within the meaning  of section 1274(d), for the month the partner's right to a preferred  return or guaranteed payment is first established or for any month in  the partnership taxable year for which the return or payment on capital  is computed. A rate in excess of the rates described in the preceding  sentence may be commercially reasonable, based on the relevant facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unreturned capital--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Unreturned capital is  computed on a weighted-average basis and equals the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of money and the fair market value of property  contributed by the partner to the partnership (net of liabilities  assumed, or taken subject to, by the partnership); over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of money and the fair market value of property (net  of liabilities assumed, or taken subject to, by the partner) distributed  by the partnership to the partner as a return of capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Return of capital. In determining whether a distribution  constitutes a return of capital, all relevant facts and circumstances  are taken into account. However, the designation of distributions in a  written partnership agreement generally will be respected in determining  whether a distribution constitutes a return of capital, so long as the  designation is economically reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Timing rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limitation on allocations of income with  respect to reasonable preferred returns for capital. Items of income and  gain (or part of what would otherwise be overall partnership income)  that may be allocated to a partner in a taxable year with respect to a  reasonable preferred return for capital are disregarded for purposes of  the fractions rule only to the extent the allocable amount will not  exceed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The aggregate of the amount that has been distributed to the  partner as a reasonable preferred return for the taxable year of the  allocation and prior taxable years, on or before the due date (not  including extensions) for filing the partnership's return for the  taxable year of the allocation; minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The aggregate amount of corresponding income and gain (and what  would otherwise be overall partnership income) allocated to the partner  in all prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, a guaranteed payment that is paid in cash on or before the  due date (not including extensions) for filing the partnership's return  for a taxable year may be treated as paid in that prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0">Facts. Qualified organization QO and taxable corporation TP form a  partnership. QO contributes $9,000 to the partnership and TP contributes  $1,000. The partnership borrows $50,000 from a third party lender and  purchases an office building for $55,000. At all relevant times the safe  harbor rate described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section equals 10  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  The partnership agreement provides that in each taxable year the  partnership's distributable cash is first to be distributed to QO as a  10 percent preferred return on its unreturned capital. To the extent the  partnership has insufficient cash to pay QO its preferred return in any  taxable year, the preferred return is compounded (at 10 percent) and is  to be paid in future years to the extent the partnership has  distributable cash. The partnership agreement first allocates gross  income and gain 100 percent to QO, to the extent cash has been  distributed to QO as a preferred return. All remaining profit or loss is  allocated 50 percent to QO and 50 percent to TP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership satisfies the fractions rule. Items of income  and gain that may be specially allocated to QO with respect to its  preferred return are disregarded in computing overall partnership income  or loss for purposes of the fractions rule because the requirements of  paragraph (d) of this section are satisfied. After disregarding those  allocations, QO's fractions rule percentage is 50 percent (see paragraph  (c)(2) of this section), and under the partnership agreement QO may not  be allocated more than 50 percent of overall partnership income in any  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 1,  except that QO's preferred return is computed on unreturned capital at a  rate that exceeds a commercially reasonable rate. The partnership  violates the fractions rule. The income and gain that may be specially  allocated to QO with respect to the preferred return is not disregarded  in computing overall partnership income or loss to the extent it exceeds  a commercially reasonable rate. See paragraph (d) of this section. As a  result, QO's fractions rule percentage is less than 50 percent (see  paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and allocations of income and gain to  QO with respect to its preferred return could result in QO being  allocated more than 50 percent of the overall partnership income in a  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The partnership agreement allocates all  bottom-line partnership income and loss 50 percent to QO and 50 percent  to TP throughout the life of the partnership. The partnership agreement  provides that QO is entitled each year to a 10 percent guaranteed  payment on unreturned capital. To the extent the partnership is unable  to make a guaranteed payment in any taxable year, the unpaid amount is  compounded at 10 percent and is to be paid in future years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. Therefore, the guaranteed payment is treated  as an item of deduction in computing overall partnership income or loss,  and the corresponding income that QO may receive or accrue with respect  to the guaranteed payment is not treated as an allocable share of  overall partnership income or loss. See paragraph (d)(3) of this  section. Accordingly, QO's fractions rule percentage is 50 percent (see  paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and under the partnership agreement  QO may not be allocated more than 50 percent of overall partnership  income in any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Chargebacks and offsets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The following  allocations are disregarded in computing overall partnership income or  loss for purposes of the fractions rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocations of what would otherwise be overall partnership  income that may be made to chargeback (i.e., reverse) prior  disproportionately large allocations of overall partnership loss (or  part of the overall partnership loss) to a qualified organization, and  allocations of what would otherwise be overall partnership loss that may  be made to chargeback prior disproportionately small allocations of  overall partnership income (or part of the overall partnership income)  to a qualified organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocations of income or gain that may be made to a partner  pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback attributable to prior allocations  of nonrecourse deductions to the partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocations of income or gain that may be made to a partner  pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback attributable to prior allocations  of partner nonrecourse deductions to the partner and allocations of  income or gain that may be made to other partners to chargeback  compensating allocations of other losses, deductions, or section  705(a)(2)(B) expenditures to the other partners; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allocations of items of income or gain that may be made to a  partner pursuant to a qualified income offset, within the meaning of  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Allocations made in taxable years beginning on or after January  1, 2002, that are mandated by statute or regulation other than  subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disproportionate allocations--(i) In general. To qualify under  paragraph (e)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, prior disproportionate allocations  may be reversed in full or in part, and in any order, but must be  reversed in the same ratio as originally made. A prior allocation is  disproportionately large if the qualified organization's percentage  share of that allocation exceeds its fractions rule percentage. A prior  allocation is disproportionately small if the qualified organization's  percentage share of that allocation is less than its fractions rule  percentage. However, a prior allocation (or allocations) is not  considered disproportionate unless the balance of the overall  partnership income or loss for the taxable year of the allocation is  allocated in a manner that would independently satisfy the fractions  rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on chargebacks of partial allocations. Except in the  case of a chargeback allocation pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of this  section, and except as otherwise provided by the Internal Revenue  Service by revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or, on a case-by-case  basis, by letter ruling, paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section applies to  a chargeback of an allocation of part of the overall partnership income  or loss only if that part consists of a pro rata portion of each item of  partnership income, gain, loss, and deduction (other than nonrecourse  deductions, as well as partner nonrecourse deductions and compensating  allocations) that is included in computing overall partnership income or  loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum gain chargebacks attributable to nonrecourse deductions.  Commencing with the first taxable year of the partnership in which a  minimum gain chargeback (or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain  chargeback) occurs, a chargeback to a partner is attributable to  nonrecourse deductions (or separately, on a debt-by-debt basis, to  partner nonrecourse deductions) in the same proportion that the  partner's percentage share of the partnership minimum gain (or  separately, on a debt-by-debt basis, the partner nonrecourse debt  minimum gain) at the end of the immediately preceding taxable year is  attributable to nonrecourse deductions (or partner   nonrecoursedeductions). The partnership must determine the extent to  which a partner's percentage share of the partnership minimum gain (or  partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain) is attributable to deductions in  a reasonable and consistent manner. For example, in those cases in which  none of the exceptions contained in Sec. 1.704-2(f) (2) through (5) are  relevant, a partner's percentage share of the partnership minimum gain  generally is attributable to nonrecourse deductions in the same ratio  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of the nonrecourse deductions previously  allocated to the partner but not charged back in prior taxable years;  bears to</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this  section, plus the aggregate amount of distributions previously made to  the partner of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability allocable to an  increase in partnership minimum gain but not charged back in prior  taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Minimum gain chargebacks attributable to distribution of  nonrecourse debt proceeds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Chargebacks disregarded until allocations  made. Allocations of items of income and gain that may be made pursuant  to a provision in the partnership agreement that charges back minimum  gain attributable to the distribution of proceeds of a nonrecourse  liability (or a partner nonrecourse debt) are taken into account for  purposes of the fractions rule only to the extent an allocation is made.  (See paragraph (d)(2) of this section, pursuant to which there is  permanently excluded chargeback allocations of minimum gain that are  attributable to proceeds distributed as a reasonable preferred return.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain minimum gain chargebacks related to returns of capital.  Allocations of items of income or gain that (in accordance with  Sec. 1.704-2(f)(1)) may be made to a partner pursuant to a minimum gain  chargeback attributable to the distribution of proceeds of a nonrecourse  liability are disregarded in computing overall partnership income or  loss for purposes of the fractions rule to the extent that the  allocations (subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this  section) also charge back prior disproportionately large allocations of  overall partnership loss (or part of the overall partnership loss) to a  qualified organization. This exception applies only to the extent the  disproportionately large allocation consisted of depreciation from real  property (other than items of nonrecourse deduction or partner  nonrecourse deduction) that subsequently was used to secure the  nonrecourse liability providing the distributed proceeds, and only if  those proceeds were distributed as a return of capital and in the same  proportion as the disproportionately large allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified organization QO and taxable  corporation TP form a partnership. QO contributes $900 to the  partnership and TP contributes $100. The partnership agreement allocates  overall partnership loss 50 percent to QO and 50 percent to TP until  TP's capital account is reduced to zero; then 100 percent to QO until  QO's capital account is reduced to zero; and thereafter 50 percent to QO  and 50 percent to TP. Overall partnership income is allocated first 100  percent to QO to chargeback overall partnership loss allocated 100  percent to QO, and thereafter 50 percent to QO and 50 percent to TP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership satisfies the fractions rule. QO's fractions  rule percentage is 50 percent. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  Therefore, the 100 percent allocation of overall partnership loss to QO  is disproportionately large. See paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.  Accordingly, the 100 percent allocation to QO of what would otherwise be  overall partnership income (if it were not disregarded), which charges  back the disproportionately large allocation of overall partnership  loss, is disregarded in computing overall partnership income and loss  for purposes of the fractions rule. The 100 percent allocation is in the  same ratio as the disproportionately large loss allocation, and the rest  of the allocations for the taxable year of the disproportionately large  loss allocation will independently satisfy the fractions rule. See  paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. After disregarding the chargeback  allocation of 100 percent of what would otherwise be overall partnership  income, QO will not be allocated a percentage share of overall  partnership income in excess of its fractions rule percentage for any  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified organization QO and taxable   corporation TP form a partnership. QO contributes $900 to the  partnership and TP contributes $100. The partnership purchases real  property with money contributed by its partners and with money borrowed  by the partnership on a recourse basis. In any year, the partnership  agreement allocates the first $500 of overall partnership income 50  percent to QO and 50 percent to TP; the next $100 of overall partnership  income 100 percent to TP (as an incentive for TP to achieve significant  profitability in managing the partnership'soperations); and all  remaining overall partnership income 50 percent to QO and 50 percent to  TP. Overall partnership loss is allocated first 100 percent to TP to  chargeback overall partnership income allocated 100 percent to TP at any  time in the prior three years and not reversed; and thereafter 50  percent to QO and 50 percent to TP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership satisfies the fractions rule. QO's fractions  rule percentage is 50 percent because qualifying chargebacks are  disregarded pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) in computing overall  partnership income or loss. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The  zero percent allocation to QO of what would otherwise be overall  partnership loss is a qualifying chargeback that is disregarded because  it is in the same ratio as the income allocation it charges back,  because the rest of the allocations for the taxable year of that income  allocation will independently satisfy the fractions rule (see paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section), and because it charges back an allocation of  zero overall partnership income to QO, which is proportionately smaller  (i.e., disproportionately small) than QO's 50 percent fractions rule  percentage. After disregarding the chargeback allocation of 100 percent  of what would otherwise be overall partnership loss, QO will not be  allocated a percentage share of overall partnership income in excess of  its fractions rule percentage for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified organization QO  and taxable corporation TP form a partnership to own and operate  encumbered real property. QO and TP each contribute $500 to the  partnership. In addition, QO makes a $300 nonrecourse loan to the  partnership. The partnership agreement contains a partner nonrecourse  debt minimum gain chargeback provision and a provision that allocates  partner nonrecourse deductions to the partner who bears the economic  burden of the deductions in accordance with Sec. 1.704-2. The  partnership agreement also provides that to the extent partner  nonrecourse deductions are allocated to QO in any taxable year, other  compensating items of partnership loss or deduction (and, if  appropriate, section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures) will first be allocated  100 percent to TP. In addition, to the extent items of income or gain  are allocated to QO in any taxable year pursuant to a partner  nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback of deductions, items of  partnership income and gain will first be allocated 100 percent to TP.  The partnership agreement allocates all other overall partnership income  or loss 50 percent to QO and 50 percent to TP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership satisfies the fractions rule on a prospective  basis. The allocations of the partner nonrecourse deductions and the  compensating allocation of other items of loss, deduction, and  expenditure that may be made to TP (but which will not be made unless  there is an allocation of partner nonrecourse deductions to QO) are not  taken into account for purposes of the fractions rule until a taxable  year in which an allocation is made. See paragraph (j)(1) of this  section. In addition, partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargebacks  of deductions and allocations of income or gain to other partners that  chargeback compensating allocations of other deductions are disregarded  in computing overall partnership income or loss for purposes of the  fractions rule. See paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Since all  other overall partnership income and loss is allocated 50 percent to QO  and 50 percent to TP, QO's fractions rule percentage is 50 percent (see  paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and QO will not be allocated a  percentage share of overall partnership income in excess of its  fractions rule percentage for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3,  except that the partnership agreement provides that compensating  allocations of loss or deduction (and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures)  to TP will not be charged back until year 10. The partners expect $300  of partner nonrecourse deductions to be allocated to QO in year 1 and  $300 of income or gain to be allocated to QO in year 2 pursuant to the  partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The partnership fails to satisfy the fractions rule on a  prospective basis under the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (k)(4) of this  section. If the partners' expectations prove correct, at the end of year  2, QO will have been allocated $300 of partner nonrecourse deductions  and an offsetting $300 of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.  However, the $300 of compensating deductions and losses that may be  allocated to TP will not be charged back until year 10. Thus, during the  period beginning at the end of year 2 and ending eight years later,  there may be $300 more of unreversed deductions and losses allocated to  TP than to QO, which would be inconsistent with the purpose of the  fractions rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified organization QO and taxable  corporation TP form a partnership. QO contributes $900 to the  partnership and TP contributes $100. The partnership agreement generally  allocates overall partnership income and loss 90 percent to QO and 10  percent to TP. However, the partnership agreement contains a minimum  gain chargeback provision, and also provides that in any partnership  taxable year in which there is a chargeback of partnership minimum gain  to QO attributable to distributions of proceeds of nonrecourse  liabilities, all other items comprising overall partnership income or  loss will be allocated in a manner such that QO is not allocated more  than 90 percent of the overall partnership income for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership satisfies the fractions rule on a prospective  basis. QO's fractions rule percentage is 90 percent. See paragraph  (c)(2) of this section. The chargeback that may be made to QO of minimum  gain attributable to distributions of nonrecourse liability proceeds is  taken into account for purposes of the fractions rule only to the extent  an allocation is made. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section.  Accordingly, that potential allocation to QO is disregarded in applying  the fractions rule on a prospective basis (see paragraph (b)(2) of this  section), and QO is treated as not being allocated a percentage share of  overall partnership income in excess of its fractions rule percentage in  any taxable year. (Similarly, QO is treated as not being allocated items  of income or gain in a taxable year when the partnership has an overall  partnership loss.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In year 3, the partnership borrows $400 on a nonrecourse basis  and distributes it to QO as a return of capital. In year 8, the  partnership has $400 of gross income and cash flow and $300 of overall  partnership income, and the partnership repays the $400 nonrecourse  borrowing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The partnership violates the fractions rule for year 8 and all  future years. Pursuant to the minimum gain chargeback provision, the  entire $400 of partnership gross income is allocated to QO. Accordingly,  notwithstanding the curative provision in the partnership agreement that  would allocate to TP the next $44 (($400/.9)x10%) of income and gain  included in computing overall partnership income, the partnership has no  other items of income and gain to allocate to QO. Because the $400 of  gross income actually allocated to QO is taken into account for purposes  of the fractions rule in the year an allocation is made (see paragraph  (e)(4) of this section), QO's percentage share of overall partnership  income in year 8 is greater than 100 percent. Since this exceeds QO's  fractions rule percentage (i.e., 90 percent), the partnership violates  the fractions rule for year 8 and all subsequent taxable years. See  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exclusion of reasonable partner-specific items of deduction or  loss. Provided that the expenditures are allocated to the partners to  whom they are attributable, the following partner-specific expenditures  are disregarded in computing overall partnership income or loss for  purposes of the fractions rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Expenditures for additional record-keeping and accounting  incurred in connection with the transfer of a partnership interest  (including expenditures incurred in computing basis adjustments under  section 743(b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional administrative costs that result from having a  foreign partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State and local taxes or expenditures relating to those taxes;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expenditures designated by the Internal Revenue Service by  revenue ruling or revenue procedure, or, on a case-by-case basis, by  letter ruling. (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em>, a loss or deduction must have a low likelihood  of occurring, taking into account all relevant facts, circumstances, and  information available to the partners (including bona fide financial  projections). The types of events that may give rise to unlikely losses  or deductions, depending on the facts and circumstances, include tort  and other third-party litigation that give rise to unforeseen  liabilities in excess of reasonable insurance coverage; unanticipated  labor strikes; unusual delays in securing required permits or licenses;  abnormal weather conditions (considering the season and the job site);  significant delays in leasing property due to an unanticipated severe  economic downturn in the geographic area; unanticipated cost overruns;  and the discovery of environmental conditions   that require remediation. No inference is drawn as to whether a loss or  deduction is unlikely from the fact that the partnership agreement  includes a provision for allocating that loss or deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Provisions preventing deficit capital account balances. A  provision in the partnership agreement that allocates items of loss or  deduction away from a qualified organization in instances where  allocating those items to the qualified organization would cause or  increase a deficit balance in its capital account that the qualified  organization is not obligated to restore (within the meaning of  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) (b) or (d)), is disregarded for purposes of the  fractions rule in taxable years of the partnership in which no such  allocations are made pursuant to the provision. However, this exception  applies only if, at the time the provision becomes part of the  partnership agreement, all relevant facts, circumstances, and  information (including bona fide financial projections) available to the  partners reasonably indicate that it is unlikely that an allocation will  be made pursuant to the provision during the life of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Exception for partner nonrecourse deductions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Partner  nonrecourse deductions disregarded until actually allocated. Items of  partner nonrecourse deduction that may be allocated to a partner  pursuant to Sec. 1.704-2, and compensating allocations of other items of  loss, deduction, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures that may be  allocated to other partners, are not taken into account for purposes of  the fractions rule until the taxable years in which they are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disproportionate allocation of partner nonrecourse deductions to  a qualified organization. A violation of the fractions rule will be  disregarded if it arises because an allocation of partner nonrecourse  deductions to a qualified organization that is not motivated by tax  avoidance reduces another qualified organization's fractions rule  percentage below what it would have been absent the allocation of the  partner nonrecourse deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Changes in partnership allocations arising  from a change in the partners' interests. A qualified organization that  acquires a partnership interest from another qualified organization is  treated as a continuation of the prior qualified organization partner  (to the extent of that acquired interest) for purposes of applying the  fractions rule. Changes in partnership allocations that result from  other transfers or shifts of partnership interests will be closely  scrutinized (to determine whether the transfer or shift stems from a  prior agreement, understanding, or plan or could otherwise be expected  given the structure of the transaction), but generally will be taken  into account only in determining whether the partnership satisfies the  fractions rule in the taxable year of the change and subsequent taxable  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> De minimis interest rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Section  514(c)(9)(B)(vi) does not apply to a partnership otherwise subject to  that section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Qualified organizations do not hold, in the aggregate, interests  of greater than five percent in the capital or profits of the  partnership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxable partners own substantial interests in the partnership  through which they participate in the partnership on substantially the  same terms as the qualified organization partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. Partnership PRS has two types of limited partnership  interests that participate in partnership profits and losses on  different terms. Qualified organizations (QOs) only own one type of  limited partnership interest and own no general partnership interests.  In the aggregate, the QOs own less than five percent of the capital and  profits of PRS. Taxable partners also own the same type of limited  partnership interest that the QOs own. These limited partnership  interests owned by the taxable partners are 30 percent of the capital  and profits of PRS. Thirty percent is a substantial interest in the  partnership. Therefore, PRS satisfies paragraph (k)(2) of this section  and section 514(c)(9)(B)(vi) does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> De minimis allocations disregarded. A qualified organization's  fractions rule percentage of the partnership's items of loss and  deduction, other than nonrecourse and partner nonrecourse deductions,  that are allocated away from the qualified organization and to   other partners in any taxable year are treated as having been allocated  to the qualified organization for purposes of the fractions rule if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The allocation was neither planned nor motivated by tax  avoidance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total amount of those items of partnership loss or  deduction is less than both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One percent of the partnership's aggregate items of gross loss  and deduction for the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Anti-abuse rule. The purpose of the fractions rule is to prevent  tax avoidance by limiting the permanent or temporary transfer of tax  benefits from tax-exempt partners to taxable partners, whether by  directing income or gain to tax-exempt partners, by directing losses,  deductions, or credits to taxable partners, or by some other similar  manner. This section may not be applied in a manner that is inconsistent  with the purpose of the fractions rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Tiered partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a qualified organization  holds an indirect interest in real property through one or more tiers of  partnerships (a chain), the fractions rule is satisfied only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The avoidance of tax is not a principal purpose for using the  tiered-ownership structure (investing in separate real properties  through separate chains of partnerships so that section 514(c)(9)(E) is,  effectively, applied on a property-by-property basis is not, in and of  itself, a tax avoidance purpose); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The relevant partnerships can demonstrate under any reasonable  method that the relevant chains satisfy the requirements of paragraphs  (b)(2) through (k) of this section. For purposes of applying Sec. 1.704- 2(k) under the independent chain approach described in Example 3 of  paragraph (m)(2) of this section, allocations of items of income or gain  that may be made pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement  that charges back minimum gain are taken into account for purposes of  the fractions rule only to the extent an allocation is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Qualified  organization QO3 and taxable individual TP3 form upper-tier partnership  P2. The P2 partnership agreement allocates overall partnership income 20  percent to QO3 and 80 percent to TP3. Overall partnership loss is  allocated 30 percent to QO3 and 70 percent to TP3. P2 and taxable  individual TP2 form lower-tier partnership P1. The P1 partnership  agreement allocates overall partnership income 60 percent to P2 and 40  percent to TP2. Overall partnership loss is allocated 40 percent to P2  and 60 percent to TP2. The only asset of P2 (which has no outstanding  debt) is its interest in P1. P1 purchases real property with money  contributed by its partners and with borrowed money. There is no tax  avoidance purpose for the use of the tiered-ownership structure, which  is illustrated by the following diagram.

P2A has been  established for the purpose of investing in numerous real estate  properties independently of P2B and its partners. P2B has been  established for the purpose of investing in numerous real estate  properties independently of P2A and its partners. Neither P2A nor P2B  has outstanding debt.

The P2B/ P1 chain (Chain B) will satisfy the fractions rule if P1 and P2B can  demonstrate in a reasonable manner that they satisfy the requirements of  paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. To meet its burden, P1  treats P2A and P2B as qualified organizations. Provided that the  allocations that may be made by P1 would satisfy the fractions rule if  P2A and P2B were direct qualified organization partners in P1, Chain A  will satisfy the fractions rule (for the benefit of QO3A) if the  allocations that may be made by P2A satisfy the requirements of  paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. Similarly, Chain B will  satisfy the fractions rule (for the benefit of QO3B) if the allocations  that may be made by P2B satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)  through (k) of this section. Under these facts, QO3A does not have to  know how income and loss may be allocated by P2B, and QO3B does not have  to know how income and loss may be allocated by P2A.

On this date, there is a complete liquidation of M  Corporation to which section 331(a)(1) applies. In the liquidation T  receives a distribution in kind of depreciable assets and assumes $7,000  of M's indebtedness which remains unpaid with respect to the depreciable  assets. On this date, M's adjusted basis of these depreciable assets is  $9,000, and such assets have a fair market value of $47,000. M  recognizes gain of $6,000 with respect to this liquidation pursuant to  sections 1245 and 1250. T realizes a gain of $25,000 (the difference  between the excess of fair market value of the property received over  the indebtedness assumed, $40,000 ($47,000-$7,000) and T's basis in M's  stock, $15,000). A portion of this gain is to be treated as unrelated  debt-financed income. This amount is determined by multiplying T's gain  of $25,000 by the debt/basis percentage. The debt/basis percentage is 20  percent, the ratio which the average acquisition indebtedness ($3,000)  is of the average adjusted basis ($15,000). Thus, $5,000 (20 percent of  $25,000) is unrelated debt-financed income. This amount and the gain  recognized pursuant to sections 1245 and 1250 are added to M's basis to  determine T's basis in the property received. Consequently, T's basis in  the property received from M Corporation is $20,000, determined as  follows:  M Corporation's adjusted basis..............................      $9,000 Gain recognized by M Corporation on the distribution........       6,000</p><p class="depth0">Unrelated debt-financed income recognized by T with respect        5,000</p><p class="depth0">to the distribution........................................</p><p class="depth0">----------- T's transferred basis.......................................      20,000</p><p class="depth0">[T.D. 7229, 37 FR 28153, Dec. 21, 1972]    Sec. 1.514(e)-1  Allocation rules.</p><p class="depth0">Where only a portion of property is debt-financed property, proper  allocation of the basis, indebtedness, income, and deductions with  respect to such property must be made to determine the amount of income  or gain derived from such property which is to be treated as unrelated  debt-financed income.

For  example, a 3-year lease with an option for renewal for another such  period is considered a lease for a term of 6 years. Another example is  the case of a 1-year lease with option of renewal for another such term,  where the parties at the end of each year renew the arrangement. In this  case, during the fifth year (but not during the first 4 years), the  lease falls within the 5-year rule, since the lease then involves 5  years and there is an option for the sixth year. In determining the term  of the lease, an option for renewal of the lease is taken into account  whether or not the exercise of the option depends upon conditions or  contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the property is acquired subject to a lease, the term of such  lease shall be considered to begin on the date of such acquisition. For  example, if an exempt organization purchases, in whole or in part with  borrowed funds, real property subject to a 10-year lease which has 3  years left to run, and such lease contains no right of renewal or  extension, the lease shall be considered a 3-year lease and hence does  not meet the definition of a business lease in section 514(f) and  paragraph (a) of this section. However, if this lease contains an option  to renew for a period of 3 years or more, it is a business lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A lease shall not be considered a business lease  if such lease is entered into primarily for a purpose which is  substantially related (aside from the need of such organization for  income or funds, or the use it makes of the rents derived) to the  exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable,  educational, or other purpose or function constituting   the basis for its exemption. For example, where a tax-exempt hospital  leases real property owned by it to an association of doctors for use as  a clinic, the rents derived under such lease would not be included in  computing unrelated business taxable income if the clinic is  substantially related to the carrying on of hospital functions. See  Sec. 1.513-1 for principles applicable in determining whether there is a  substantial relationship to the exempt purpose of an organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A lease is not a business lease if the lease is of premises in a  building primarily designed for occupancy and occupied by the tax-exempt  organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a lease for more than 5 years to a tenant is for only a  portion of the real property, and space in the real property is rented  during the taxable year under a lease for not more than 5 years to any  other tenant of the tax-exempt organization, all leases of the real  property for more than 5 years shall be considered as business leases  during the taxable year only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rents derived from the real property during the taxable year  under leases for more than 5 years represent 50 percent or more of the  total rents derived during the taxable year from the real property; or  the area of the premises occupied under leases for more than 5 years  represents, at any time during the taxable year, 50 percent or more of  the total area of the real property rented at such time; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rent derived from the real property during the taxable year  from any tenant under a lease for more than 5 years, or from a group of  tenants (under such leases) who are either members of an affiliated  group (as defined in section 1504) or are partners, represents more than  10 percent of the total rents derived during the taxable year from such  property; or the area of the premises occupied by any one such tenant,  or by any such group of tenants, represents at any time during the  taxable year more than 10 percent of the total area of the real property  rented at such time   In determining whether 50 percent or more of the total rents are derived  from leases for more than 5 years, or whether 50 percent or more of the  total area is occupied under leases for more than 5 years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An occupancy which is considered to be a lease of more than 5  years solely by reason of the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this  subparagraph shall not be treated as such a lease for purposes of  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An occupancy which is considered to be a lease of more than 5  years solely by reason of the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section shall be treated as such a lease for purposes of subdivision  (ii) of this subparagraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If during the last half of the term of a lease a new lease is  made to take effect after the expiration of such lease, the unexpired  portion of the first lease will not be added to the second lease to  determine whether such second lease is a lease for more than 5 years for  purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The application of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1954 an educational organization, which is on the  calendar year basis, begins the erection of an 11-story apartment  building using funds borrowed for that purpose, and immediately leases  for a 10-year term the first floor to a real estate development company  to sublet for stores and shops. As fast as the new apartments are  completed, they are rented on an annual basis. At the end of 1959 all  except the 10th and 11th floors are rented. Those two floors are  completed during 1960 and rented. Assume that for 1954 and each  subsequent taxable year through 1959, and for the taxable year 1963, the  gross rental for the first floor represents more than 10 percent of the  total gross rents derived during the taxable year from the building.  Under this set of facts the 10-year lease of the first floor would be  considered to be a business lease for all except the taxable years 1961,  1962, and 1964.  [T.D. 7229, 37 FR 28154, Dec. 21, 1972]    Sec. 1.514(g)-1  Business lease indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition. The term business lease indebtedness means, with  respect to any real property leased by a tax-exempt organization for a  term of more than 5 years, the unpaid amount of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The indebtedness incurred by the lessor tax-exempt organization  in acquiring or improving such property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The indebtedness incurred by the lessor tax-exempt organization  prior to the acquisition or improvement of such property if such  indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or  improvement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The indebtedness incurred by the lessor tax-exempt organization  subsequent to the acquisition or improvement of such property if such  indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or  improvement and the incurrence of the indebtedness was reasonably  foreseeable at the time of such acquisition or improvement   See paragraph (i) of this section with respect to subsidiary  corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The rules of section 514(g) respecting business leases  also cover certain cases where the leased property itself is not subject  to an indebtedness. For example, they apply to cases such as the  following:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A university pledges some of its investment securities  with a bank for a loan and uses the proceeds of such loan to purchase  (either directly or through a subsidiary corporation) a building, which  building is subject to a lease that then has more than 5 years to run.  This would be an example of a business lease indebtedness incurred prior  to the acquisition of the property which would not have been incurred  but for such acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. If the building itself in example 1 in this paragraph is  later mortgaged to raise funds to release the pledged securities, the  lease would continue to be a business lease.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. If a scientific organization mortgages its laboratory  building to replace working capital used in remodeling another one of  its buildings or a building held by its subsidiary corporation, which  other building is free of indebtedness and is subject to a lease that  then has more than 5 years to run, the lease would be a business lease  inasmuch as the indebtedness though incurred subsequent to the  improvement of such property would not have been incurred but for such  improvement, and the incurrence of the indebtedness was reasonably  foreseeable when, to make such improvement, the organization reduced its  working capital below the amount necessary to continue current  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Property acquired subject to lien. Where real property is  acquired subject to a mortgage or similar lien, whether the acquisition  be by gift, bequest, devise, or purchase, the amount of the indebtedness  secured by such mortgage or lien is a business lease indebtedness  (unless paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies) even though the lessor  does not assume or agree to pay the indebtedness. For example, a  university pays $100,000 for real estate valued at $300,000 and subject  to a $200,000 mortgage. For the purpose of the tax on unrelated business  taxable income, the result is the same as if $200,000 of borrowed funds  had been used to buy the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certain property acquired by gifts, etc. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where real property  was acquired by gift, bequest, or devise, before July 1, 1950, subject  to a mortgage or other similar lien, the amount of such mortgage or  other similar lien shall not be considered as an indebtedness of the  lessor tax-exempt organization incurred in acquiring such property. An  indebtedness not otherwise covered by this exception is not brought  within the exception by reason of a transfer of the property between a  parent and its subsidiary corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where real property was acquired by gift, bequest, or devise,  before July 1, 1950, subject to a lease requiring improvements in such  property upon the happening of stated contingencies, indebtedness  incurred in improving such property in accordance with the terms of such  lease shall not be considered as indebtedness described in section  514(g) and in this section. An indebtedness not otherwise covered by  this exception is not brought within the exception by reason of a  transfer of the property between a parent and its subsidiary  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2). In the case  of a title holding corporation described in section 501(c)(2), all of  the stock of which was acquired before July 1, 1950, by an organization  described in section 501(c) (3), (5), or (6) (and more than one-third of  such stock was acquired by such organization by gift or bequest), any  indebtedness incurred by such corporation before July 1, 1950, and any  indebtedness incurred by such corporation on or after such date in  improving real property in accordance with the terms of a lease entered  into before such date, shall not be considered an indebtedness described  in section 514(g) and in this   section with respect to either such section 501(c)(2) corporation or  such section 501(c) (3), (5), or (6) organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain trusts described in section 401(a). In the case of a  trust described in section 401(a), or in the case of a corporation  described in section 501(c)(2) all of the stock of which was acquired  before March 1, 1954, by such a trust, any indebtedness incurred by such  trust or such corporation before such date, in connection with real  property which is leased before such date, and any indebtedness incurred  by such trust or such corporation on or after such date necessary to  carry out the terms of such lease, shall not be considered as an  indebtedness described in section 514(g) and in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Business lease on portion of property. Where only a portion of  the real property is subject to a business lease, proper allocation of  the indebtedness applicable to the whole property must be made to the  premises covered by the lease. See example 2 of paragraph (b)(3) of  Sec. 1.514(a)-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rule applicable to trusts described in section 401(a).  If an employees' trust described in section 401(a) lends any money to  another such employees' trust of the same employer, for the purpose of  acquiring or improving real property, such loan will not be treated as  an indebtedness of the borrowing trust except to the extent that the  loaning trust:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Incurs any indebtedness in order to make such loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Incurred indebtedness before the making of such loan which would  not have been incurred but for the making of such loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incurred indebtedness after the making of such loan which would  not have been incurred but for the making of such loan and which was  reasonably foreseeable at the time of making such loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subsidiary corporations. The provisions of section 514(f), (g),  and (h) are applicable whether or not a subsidiary corporation of the  type described in section 501(c)(2) is availed of in making the business  lease. For example, assume a parent organization borrows funds to  purchase realty and sets up a separate section 501(c)(2) corporation as  a subsidiary to hold the property. Such subsidiary corporation leases  the property for a period of more than 5 years, collects the rents and  pays over all of the income, less expenses, to the parent organization,  the parent organization being liable for the indebtedness. Under these  assumed facts, the lease by section 501(c)(2) subsidiary corporation  would be a business lease with respect to such subsidiary corporation,  and the rental income would be subject to the tax, whether or not the  subsidiary itself assumes the indebtedness and whether or not the  property is subject to the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Certain trusts described in section 501(c)(17). (1) In the case  of a supplemental unemployment benefit trust described in section  501(c)(17), or in the case of a corporation described in section  501(c)(2) all of the stock of which was acquired before January 1, 1960,  by such a trust, any indebtedness incurred by such trust or such  corporation before such date, in connection with real property which is  leased before such date, and any indebtedness incurred by such trust or  such corporation on or after such date necessary to carry out the terms  of such lease, shall not be considered as an indebtedness described in  section 514(g) and in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a supplemental unemployment benefit trust described in  section 501(c)(17) lends any money to another such supplemental  unemployment benefit trust forming part of the same plan, for the  purpose of acquiring or improving real property, such loan will not be  treated as an indebtedness of the borrowing trust except to the extent  that the loaning trust:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incurs any indebtedness in order to make such loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incurred indebtedness before the making of such loan which  would not have been incurred but for the making of such loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Incurred indebtedness after the making of such loan which  would not have been incurred but for the making of such loan and which  was reasonably foreseeable at the time of making such loan.
