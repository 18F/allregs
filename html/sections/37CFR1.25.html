                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the convenience of attorneys, and the general public in paying any fees due, in ordering services offered by the Office, copies of records, etc., deposit accounts may be established in the Patent and Trademark Office upon payment of the fee for establishing a deposit account (Sec.  1.21(b)(1)). A minimum deposit of $1,000 is required for paying any fees due or in ordering any services offered by the Office. However, a minimum deposit of $300 may be paid to establish a restricted subscription deposit account used exclusively for subscription order of patent copies as issued. At the end of each month, a deposit account statement will be rendered. A remittance must be made promptly upon receipt of the statement to cover the value of items or services charged to the account and thus restore the account to its established normal deposit. An amount sufficient to cover all fees, services, copies, etc., requested must always be on deposit. Charges to accounts with insufficient funds will not be accepted. A service

charge (Sec.  1.21(b)(2)) will be assessed for each month that the balance at the end of the month is below $1,000. For restricted subscription deposit accounts, a service charge (Sec.  1.21(b)(3)) will be assessed for each month that the balance at the end of the month is below $300.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing, issue, appeal, international-type search report, international application processing, international design application fees, petition, and post-issuance fees may be charged against these accounts if sufficient funds are on deposit to cover such fees. A general authorization to charge all fees, or only certain fees, set forth in Sec. Sec.  1.16 through 1.18 to a deposit account containing sufficient funds may be filed in an individual application, either for the entire pendency of the application or with a particular paper filed. A general authorization to charge fees in an international design application set forth in Sec.  1.1031 will only be effective for the transmittal fee (Sec.  1.1031(a)). An authorization to charge fees under Sec.  1.16 in an international application entering the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 will be treated as an authorization to charge fees under Sec.  1.492. An authorization to charge fees set forth in Sec.  1.18 to a deposit account is subject to the provisions of Sec.  1.311(b). An authorization to charge to a deposit account the fee for a request for reexamination pursuant to Sec.  1.510 or 1.913 and any other fees required in a reexamination proceeding in a patent may also be filed with the request for reexamination, and an authorization to charge to a deposit account the fee for a request for supplemental examination pursuant to Sec.  1.610 and any other fees required in a supplemental examination proceeding in a patent may also be filed with the request for supplemental examination. An authorization to charge a fee to a deposit account will not be considered payment of the fee on the date the authorization to charge the fee is effective unless sufficient funds are present in the account to cover the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A deposit account holder may replenish the deposit account by submitting a payment to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. A payment to replenish a deposit account must be submitted by one of the methods set forth in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A payment to replenish a deposit account may be submitted by electronic funds transfer through the Federal Reserve Fedwire System, which requires that the following information be provided to the deposit account holder's bank or financial institution:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the Bank, which is Treas NYC (Treasury New York City);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bank Routing Code, which is 021030004;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> United States Patent and Trademark Office account number with the Department of the Treasury, which is 13100001; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The deposit account holder's company name and deposit account number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A payment to replenish a deposit account may be submitted by electronic funds transfer over the Office's Internet Web site (www.uspto.gov).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A payment to replenish a deposit account may be addressed to: Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Attn: Deposit Accounts, 2051 Jamieson Avenue, Suite 300, Alexandria, Virginia 22314.
