                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of general Medicare principles. In determining  whether and to what extent a specific type or item of cost is allowable,  such as interest, depreciation, bad debts and owner compensation, the  MAC applies the principles for reimbursement of provider costs, as set  forth in part 413 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Typical RHC and FQHC costs. The following types and items of  cost are included in allowable costs to the extent that they are covered  and reasonable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for the services of a physician, physician  assistant, nurse practitioner, certified nurse-midwife, visiting  registered professional or licensed practical nurse, clinical  psychologist, and clinical social worker who owns, is employed by, or  furnishes services under contract to a FQHC or RHC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compensation for the duties that a supervising physician is  required to perform under the agreement specified in Sec. 491.8 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs of services and supplies incident to the services of a  physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife,  qualified clinical psychologist, or clinical social worker.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Overhead costs, including RHC or FQHC administration, costs  applicable to use and maintenance of the entity, and depreciation costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Costs of services purchased by the RHC or FQHC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tests of reasonableness of cost and utilization. Tests of  reasonableness authorized by sections 1833(a) and 1861(v)(1)(A) of the  Act may be established by CMS or the MAC with respect to direct or  indirect overall costs, costs of specific items and services, or costs  of groups of items and services. For RHCs and FQHCs that are authorized  to bill under the reasonable cost system, these tests include, but are  not limited to, screening guidelines and payment limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Screening guidelines. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Costs in excess of amounts established  by the guidelines are not included unless the RHC or FQHC that is  authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system provides reasonable  justification satisfactory to the MAC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Screening guidelines are used to assess the costs of services,  including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compensation for the professional and supervisory services of  physicians and for the services of physician assistants, nurse  practitioners, and nurse-midwives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Services of physicians, physician assistants, nurse  practitioners, nurse-midwives, visiting nurses, qualified clinical  psychologists, and clinical social workers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The level of administrative and general expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Staffing (for example, the ratio of other RHC or FQHC personnel  to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The reasonableness of payments for services purchased by the RHC  or FQHC, subject to the limitation that the costs of physician services  purchased by the RHC or FQHC may not exceed amounts determined under the  applicable provisions of subpart E of part 405 or part 415 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment limitations. Limits on payments may be set by CMS, on  the basis of costs estimated to be reasonable for the provision of such  services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Graduate medical education. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective for portions of cost  reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 1999, if an RHC or an  FQHC incurs ``all or substantially all'' of the costs for the training  program in the nonhospital setting as defined in Sec. 413.75(b) of this  chapter, the RHC or FQHC may receive direct graduate medical education  payment for those residents. However, in connection with cost reporting  periods for which ``all or substantially all of the costs for the  training program in the nonhospital setting'' is not defined in Sec.  413.75(b) of this chapter, if an RHC or an FQHC incurs the salaries and  fringe benefits (including travel and lodging where applicable) of  residents training at the RHC or FQHC, the RHC or FQHC may receive  direct graduate medical education payments for those residents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct graduate medical education costs are not included as  allowable cost under Sec. 405.2466(b)(1)(i); and therefore, are not  subject to the limit on the all-inclusive rate for allowable costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allowable graduate medical education costs must be reported on  the RHC's or the FQHC's cost report under a separate cost center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allowable graduate medical education costs are non-reimbursable  if payment for these costs are received from a hospital or a Medicare  Advantage organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allowable direct graduate medical education costs under  paragraphs (f)(6) and (f)(7)(i) of this section, are subject to  reasonable cost principles under part 413 and the reasonable  compensation equivalency limits in Sec. Sec. 415.60 and 415.70 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The allowable direct graduate medical education costs are those  costs incurred by the nonhospital site for the educational activities  associated with patient care services of an approved program, subject to  the redistribution and community support principles in Sec. 413.85(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The following costs are allowable direct graduate medical  education costs to the extent that they are reasonable--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The costs of the residents' salaries and fringe benefits  (including travel and lodging expenses where applicable).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The portion of teaching physicians' salaries and fringe benefits  that are related to the time spent teaching and supervising residents.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Facility overhead costs that are allocated to direct graduate  medical education.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following costs are not allowable graduate medical  education costs--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Costs associated with training, but not related to patient care  services.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Normal operating and capital-related costs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The marginal increase in patient care costs that the RHC or FQHC  experiences as a result of having an approved program.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The costs associated with activities described in Sec.  413.85(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Payment is equal to the product of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The RHC's or the FQHC's allowable direct graduate medical  education costs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Medicare's share, which is equal to the ratio of Medicare  visits to the total number of visits (as defined in Sec. 405.2463).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Direct graduate medical education payments to RHCs and FQHCs  made under this section are made from the Federal Supplementary Medical  Insurance Trust Fund.
