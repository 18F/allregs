                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>, an employer may require the employee to provide a copy of  the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued  by the military which indicates that the military member is on covered  active duty or call to covered active duty status, and the dates of the  military member's covered active duty service. This information need  only be provided to the employer once. A copy of new active duty orders  or other documentation issued by the military may be required by the  employer if the need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arises  out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty  status (or notification of an impending call or order to covered active  duty) of the same or a different military member;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required information. An employer may require that leave for any  qualifying exigency specified in Sec. 825.126 be supported by a  certification from the employee that sets forth the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement or description, signed by the employee, of  appropriate facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which FMLA leave  is requested. The facts must be sufficient to support the need for  leave. Such facts should include information on the type of qualifying  exigency for which leave is requested and any available written  documentation which supports the request for leave; such documentation,  for example, may include a copy of a meeting announcement for  informational briefings sponsored by the military, a document confirming  an appointment with a counselor or school official, or a copy of a bill  for services for the handling of legal or financial affairs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency commenced  or will commence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency  for a single, continuous period of time, the beginning and end dates for  such absence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency  on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, an estimate of the  frequency and duration of the qualifying exigency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party,  appropriate contact information for the individual or entity with whom  the employee is meeting (such as the name, title, organization, address,  telephone number, fax number, and email address) and a brief description  of the purpose of the meeting; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the qualifying exigency involves Rest and Recuperation leave,  a copy of the military member's Rest and Recuperation orders, or other  documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military  member has been granted Rest and Recuperation leave, and the dates of  the military member's Rest and Recuperation leave.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOL has developed an optional form (Form WH-384) for employees'  use in obtaining a certification that meets FMLA's certification  requirements. Form WH-384 may be obtained from local offices of the Wage  and Hour Division or from the Internet at www.dol.gov/whd. This optional  form reflects certification requirements so as to permit the employee to  furnish appropriate information to support his or her request for leave  because of a qualifying exigency. Form WH-384, or another form  containing the same basic information, may be used by the employer;  however, no information may be required beyond that specified in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Verification. If an employee submits a complete and sufficient  certification to support his or her request for leave because of a  qualifying exigency, the employer may not request additional information  from the employee. However, if the qualifying exigency involves meeting  with a third party, the employer may contact the individual or entity  with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of verifying a meeting or  appointment schedule and the nature of the meeting between the employee  and the specified individual or entity. The employee's permission is   not required in order to verify meetings or appointments with third  parties, but no additional information may be requested by the employer.  An employer also may contact an appropriate unit of the Department of  Defense to request verification that a military member is on covered  active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been notified  of an impending call or order to covered active duty); no additional  information may be requested and the employee's permission is not  required.</p>
