The port director must be satisfied that the importer of the repair component, accessory, or equipment had the declared intention at the time of importation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As used in this section, ``instruments of international traffic'' includes the normal accessories and equipment imported with any such instrument which is a ``container'' as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The reexportation of a container, as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers, which has become badly damaged, shall not be required in the case of a duly authenticated accident if the container (1) is subjected to applicable import duties and import taxes, or (2) is abandoned free of all expense to the Government or destroyed under Customs supervision at the expense of the parties concerned, following the procedure outlined in Sec. 158.43(c) of this chapter.
