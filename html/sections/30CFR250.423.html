                                Sec.  250.423  What are the requirements for pressure testing casing?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The table in this section describes the minimum test pressures for each string of casing. You may not resume drilling or other down-hole operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test, or if there is another indication of a leak, you must investigate the cause and receive approval from the appropriate BSEE District Manager for the repair to resolve the problem ensuring that the casing will provide a proper seal. The BSEE District Manager may approve or require other casing test pressures.

You must perform this test for the intermediate and production casing strings or liner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and criteria for a successful test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must perform a negative pressure test on all wells that use a subsea BOP stack or wells with mudline suspension systems. The BSEE District Manager may require you to perform additional negative pressure tests on other casing strings or liners (e.g., intermediate casing string or liner) or on wells with a surface BOP stack.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must perform a negative pressure test on your final casing string or liner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must perform a negative test prior to unlatching the BOP at any point in the well. The negative test must be performed on those components, at a minimum, that will be exposed to the negative differential pressure that will occur when the BOP is disconnected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and criteria for a successful test. If any of your test procedures or criteria for a successful test change, you must submit for approval the changes in a revised APD or APM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you have any indication of a failed negative pressure test, such as, but not limited to pressure buildup or observed flow, you must immediately investigate the cause. If your investigation confirms that a failure occurred during the negative pressure test, you must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Correct the problem and immediately contact the appropriate BSEE District Manager.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit a description of the corrective action taken and you must receive approval from the appropriate BSEE District Manager for the retest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must have two barriers in place, as required in Sec.  250.420(b)(3), prior to performing the negative pressure test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You must include documentation of the successful negative pressure test in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).
