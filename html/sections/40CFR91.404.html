                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer or equivalent load and speed measurement device. The exhaust gases generated during engine operation are sampled either raw or dilute, and specific components are analyzed through the analytical system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tests are designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. The test consists of one idle mode and four power modes with an exponential relationship between torque and speed which span the typical operating range of spark-ignition marine propulsion engines. These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per brake kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions the complete engine is tested, with all emission control devices installed and functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions the complete engine is tested, with all emission control devices installed and functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, and so forth) may be installed, but such accessory loading will be considered parasitic in nature and observed power is used in the emission calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, no maintenance is allowed without prior approval from the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 91.118.</p>
