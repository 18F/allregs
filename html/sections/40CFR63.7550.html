Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only data collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk or other commonly used electronic storage media (including, but not limited to, flash drives) to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discretion of the Administrator, you must also submit these reports, including the confidential business information, to the Administrator in the format specified by the Administrator. For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit the results of the performance test in paper submissions to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days after the date of completing each CEMS performance evaluation test (defined in 63.2) you must submit the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) data to the EPA's Central Data Exchange by using CEDRI as mentioned in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Only RATA pollutants that can be documented with the ERT (as listed on the ERT Web site) are subject to this requirement. For any performance evaluations with no corresponding RATA pollutants listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit the results of the performance evaluation in paper submissions to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must submit all reports required by Table 9 of this subpart electronically using CEDRI that is accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (www.epa.gov/cdx). However, if the reporting form specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due the report you must submit the report to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in Sec. 63.13. At the discretion of the Administrator, you must also submit these reports, to the Administrator in the format specified by the Administrator.
