                            <p class="depth0">If your impairment was expected to improve and you returned to full- time work with no significant medical limitations and acknowledge that  medical improvement has occurred, we may find that your disability ended  in the month you returned to work. Unless there is evidence showing that  your disability has not ended, we will use the medical and other  evidence already in your file and the fact that you returned to full- time work without significant limitations to determine that you are no  longer disabled.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Evidence obtained during the processing of your claim  showed that you had an impairment that was expected to improve about 18  months after your disability began. We, therefore, told you that your  claim would be reviewed again at that time. However, before the time  arrived for your scheduled medical re-examination, you told us that you  had returned to work and your impairment had improved. We reviewed your  claim immediately and found that, in the 16th month after your  disability began, you returned to full-time work without any significant  medical restrictions. Therefore, we would find that your disability  ended in the first month you returned to full-time work.  [50 FR 50137, Dec. 6, 1985, as amended at 65 FR 42791, July 11, 2000]</p>
