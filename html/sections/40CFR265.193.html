this Section if the Regional Administrator finds, as a result of a demonstration by the owner or operator, either: that alternative design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as secondary containment during the active life of the tank system or that in the event of a release that does migrate to ground water or surface water, no substantial present or potential hazard will be posed to human health or the environment. New underground tank systems may not, per a demonstration in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section, be exempted from the secondary containment requirements of this section. Application for a variance as allowed in paragraph (g) of this section does not waive compliance with the requirements of this subpart for new tank systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In deciding whether to grant a variance based on a demonstration of equivalent protection of ground water and surface water, the Regional Administrator will consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature and quantity of the waste;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed alternate design and operation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the thickness of soils between the tank system and ground water;

The Regional Administrator also will hold a public hearing, in response to a request or at his own discretion, whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the demonstration for a variance. Public notice of the hearing will be given at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing and may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to review and comment on the demonstration. These two notices may be combined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Regional Administrator will approve or disapprove the request for a variance within 90 days of receipt of the demonstration from the owner or operator and will notify in writing the owner or operator and each person who

submitted written comments or requested notice of the variance decision. If the demonstration for a variance is incomplete or does not include sufficient information, the 90-day time period will begin when the Regional Administrator receives a complete demonstration, including all information necessary to make a final determination. If the public comment period in paragraph (h)(4) of this section is extended, the 90-day time period will be similarly extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> All tank systems, until such time as secondary containment meeting the requirements of this section is provided, must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For non-enterable underground tanks, a leak test that meets the requirements of Sec. 265.191(b)(5) must be conducted at least annually;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For other than non-enterable underground tanks, and for all ancillary equipment, the owner or operator must either conduct a leak test as in paragraph (i)(1) of this section or an internal inspection or other tank integrity examination by a qualified Professional Engineer that addresses cracks, leaks, and corrosion or erosion at least annually. The owner or operator must remove the stored waste from the tank, if necessary, to allow the condition of all internal tank surfaces to be assessed.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The practices described in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Publication Guide for Inspection of Refining Equipment, Chapter XIII, ``Atmospheric and Low Pressure Storage Tanks,'' 4th edition, 1981, may be used, when applicable, as guidelines for assessing the overall condition of the tank system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must maintain on file at the facility a record of the results of the assessments conducted in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a tank system or component is found to be leaking or unfit-for-use as a result of the leak test or assessment in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements of Sec. 265.196.
