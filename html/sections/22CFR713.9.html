The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose  conditions or restrictions on the release of nonpublic records,  including a requirement that you obtain a protective order or execute a  confidentiality agreement with the other parties in the legal proceeding  that limits access to and any further disclosure of the nonpublic  records. The terms of a confidentiality agreement or protective order  must be acceptable to the Vice-President/General Counsel. In cases where  protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been  executed, OPIC may condition the release of nonpublic records on an  amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testimony. The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose  conditions or restrictions on the testimony of OPIC employees,  including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring you  and the other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the  transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used  or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which you  requested the testimony.
