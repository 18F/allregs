                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions in Sec. Sec. 1.1 and 110.2 of this chapter, the following definitions apply to this part. In the event there is a conflict in definitions, the definitions in this part control for purposes of the flight and duty limitations and rest requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Acclimated means a condition in which a flightcrew member has been in a theater for 72 hours or has been given at least 36 consecutive hours free from duty.</p><p class="depth0">Airport/standby reserve means a defined duty period during which a flightcrew member is required by a certificate holder to be at an airport for a possible assignment.</p><p class="depth0">Augmented flightcrew means a flightcrew that has more than the minimum number of flightcrew members required by the airplane type certificate to operate the aircraft to allow a flightcrew member to be replaced by another qualified flightcrew member for in-flight rest.</p><p class="depth0">Calendar day means a 24-hour period from 0000 through 2359 using Coordinated Universal Time or local time.</p><p class="depth0">Certificate holder means a person who holds or is required to hold an air carrier certificate or operating certificate issued under part 119 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Deadhead transportation means transportation of a flightcrew member as a passenger or non-operating flightcrew member, by any mode of transportation, as required by a certificate holder, excluding transportation to or from a suitable accommodation. All time spent in deadhead transportation is duty and is not rest. For purposes of determining the maximum flight duty period in Table B of this part, deadhead transportation is not considered a flight segment.</p><p class="depth0">Duty means any task that a flightcrew member performs as required by the certificate holder, including but not limited to flight duty period, flight duty, pre- and post-flight duties, administrative work, training, deadhead transportation, aircraft positioning on the ground, aircraft loading, and aircraft servicing.</p><p class="depth0">Fatigue means a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from lack of sleep or increased physical activity that can reduce a flightcrew member's alertness and ability to safely operate an aircraft or perform safety-related duties.</p><p class="depth0">Fatigue risk management system (FRMS) means a management system for a certificate holder to use to mitigate the effects of fatigue in its particular operations. It is a data-driven process and a systematic method used to continuously monitor and manage safety risks associated with fatigue-related error.</p><p class="depth0">Fit for duty means physiologically and mentally prepared and capable of performing assigned duties at the highest degree of safety.</p><p class="depth0">Flight duty period (FDP) means a period that begins when a flightcrew member is required to report for duty with the intention of conducting a flight, a series of flights, or positioning or ferrying flights, and ends when the aircraft is parked after the last flight and there is no intention for further aircraft movement by the same flightcrew member. A flight duty period includes the duties performed by the flightcrew member on behalf of the certificate holder that occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without a required intervening rest period. Examples of tasks that are part of the flight duty period include deadhead transportation, training conducted in an aircraft or flight simulator, and airport/standby reserve, if the above tasks occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without an intervening required rest period.</p><p class="depth0">Home base means the location designated by a certificate holder where a flightcrew member normally begins and ends his or her duty periods.</p><p class="depth0">Lineholder means a flightcrew member who has an assigned flight duty period and is not acting as a reserve flightcrew member.</p><p class="depth0">Long-call reserve means that, prior to beginning the rest period required by Sec. 117.25, the flightcrew member is notified by the certificate holder to report for a flight duty period following the completion of the rest period.</p><p class="depth0">Physiological night's rest means 10 hours of rest that encompasses the hours of 0100 and 0700 at the flightcrew member's home base, unless the individual has acclimated to a different theater. If the flightcrew member has acclimated to a different theater, the rest must encompass the hours of 0100 and 0700 at the acclimated location.</p><p class="depth0">Report time means the time that the certificate holder requires a flightcrew member to report for an assignment.</p><p class="depth0">Reserve availability period means a duty period during which a certificate holder requires a flightcrew member on short call reserve to be available to receive an assignment for a flight duty period.</p><p class="depth0">Reserve flightcrew member means a flightcrew member who a certificate

holder requires to be available to receive an assignment for duty.</p><p class="depth0">Rest facility means a bunk or seat accommodation installed in an aircraft that provides a flightcrew member with a sleep opportunity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Class 1 rest facility means a bunk or other surface that allows for a flat sleeping position and is located separate from both the flight deck and passenger cabin in an area that is temperature-controlled, allows the flightcrew member to control light, and provides isolation from noise and disturbance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Class 2 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin that allows for a flat or near flat sleeping position; is separated from passengers by a minimum of a curtain to provide darkness and some sound mitigation; and is reasonably free from disturbance by passengers or flightcrew members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.</p><p class="depth2">Rest period means a continuous period determined prospectively during which the flightcrew member is free from all restraint by the certificate holder, including freedom from present responsibility for work should the occasion arise.</p><p class="depth2">Scheduled means to appoint, assign, or designate for a fixed time.</p><p class="depth2">Short-call reserve means a period of time in which a flightcrew member is assigned to a reserve availability period.</p><p class="depth2">Split duty means a flight duty period that has a scheduled break in duty that is less than a required rest period.</p><p class="depth2">Suitable accommodation means a temperature-controlled facility with sound mitigation and the ability to control light that provides a flightcrew member with the ability to sleep either in a bed, bunk or in a chair that allows for flat or near flat sleeping position. Suitable accommodation only applies to ground facilities and does not apply to aircraft onboard rest facilities.</p><p class="depth2">Theater means a geographical area in which the distance between the flightcrew member's flight duty period departure point and arrival point differs by no more than 60 degrees longitude.</p><p class="depth2">Unforeseen operational circumstance means an unplanned event of insufficient duration to allow for adjustments to schedules, including unforecast weather, equipment malfunction, or air traffic delay that is not reasonably expected.</p><p class="depth2">Window of circadian low means a period of maximum sleepiness that occurs between 0200 and 0559 during a physiological night.
