The  administrative law judge may, however, within his discretion, require  that witnesses take an oath or affirmation as to testimony submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written statements may be filed any time prior to the date of  the hearing by persons who cannot appear personally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written documents and exhibits shall be tendered in  quadruplicate. When evidence is embraced in a document containing matter  not intended to be put in evidence, within the discretion of the  administrative law judge, such a document will not be received but the  person offering the same may present to the administrative law judge the  original document together with two copies of those portions of the  document intended to be put in evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At any stage of the hearing, the administrative law judge may  call for further evidence upon any matter. After the hearing has been  closed, no further evidence shall be taken, except at the request of the  Administrative Review Board, unless provision has been made at the  hearing for the later receipt of such evidence. In the event that the  Administrative Review Board shall cause the hearing to be reopened for  the purpose of receiving further evidence, due and reasonable notice of  the time and place fixed for such taking of testimony shall be given to  all persons who have appeared at the hearing or filed a notice of  intention to appear at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity  shall not be controlling. However, it shall be the policy to exclude  irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.  [17 FR 7944, Aug. 30, 1952.
