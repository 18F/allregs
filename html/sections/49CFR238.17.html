                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Beginning on January 1, 2002, the following provisions of this section apply to railroads operating Tier I passenger equipment covered by this part. A railroad may request earlier application of these requirements upon written notification to FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety as provided in Sec. 238.1(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section contains the requirements for moving passenger equipment with other than a power brake defect. (Passenger cars and other passenger equipment classified as locomotives under part 229 of this chapter are also covered by the movement restrictions contained in Sec. 229.9 of this chapter for those defective conditions covered by part 229 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on movement of passenger equipment containing defects found at time of calendar day inspection. Except as provided in Secs. 238.303(e)(15), (e)(17) and (e)(18), 238.305(c) and (d), and 238.307(c)(1), passenger equipment containing a condition not in conformity with this part at the time of its calendar day mechanical inspection may be moved from that location for repair if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the condition involves a running gear defect, the defective equipment is not used in passenger service and is moved in a non-revenue train;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the condition involves a non-running gear defect, the defective equipment may be used in passenger service in a revenue train provided that a qualified maintenance person determines that it is safe to do so, and if so, the car is locked out and empty, and all movement restrictions are observed except that the car may be occupied by a member of the train crew or a railroad employee to the extent necessary to safely operate the train;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section are met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The special requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, if applicable, are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitations on movement of passenger equipment that develops defects en route. Except as provided in Secs. 238.303(e)(15), (e)(17) and (e)(18), 238.305(c), 238.307(c)(1), and 238.503(f), passenger equipment that develops en route to its destination, after its calendar day mechanical inspection is performed and before its next calendar day mechanical inspection is performed, any condition not in compliance with this part, other than a power brake defect, may be moved only if the railroad complies with all of the following requirements or, if applicable, the specified requirements in paragraph (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to movement of equipment with a potential running gear defect, a qualified maintenance person shall determine if it is safe to move the equipment in passenger service and, if so, the maximum speed and other restrictions necessary for safely conducting the movement. If appropriate, these determinations may be made based upon a description of the defective condition provided by a crewmember. If the determinations required by this paragraph are made by an off-site qualified maintenance person based on a description of the defective condition by on-site personnel, then a qualified maintenance person shall perform a physical inspection of the defective equipment, at the first location possible, to verify the description of the defect provided by the on-site personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to movement of equipment with a non-running gear defect, a qualified person or a qualified maintenance person shall determine if it is safe to move the equipment in passenger service and, if so, the maximum speed and other restrictions necessary for safely conducting the movement. If appropriate, these determinations may be made based upon a description of the defective condition provided by the on-site personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior to movement of any defective equipment, the qualified person or qualified maintenance person shall notify the crewmember in charge of the movement of the defective equipment, who in turn shall inform all other crewmembers of the presence of the defective condition(s) and the maximum speed and other restrictions determined under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section. The movement shall be made in conformance with such restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The railroad shall maintain a record of all defects reported and their subsequent repair in the defect tracking system required in Sec. 238.19. In addition, prior to movement of the defective equipment, a tag or card placed on both sides of the defective equipment, or an automated tracking system, shall record the following information about the defective equipment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reporting mark and car or locomotive number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the inspecting railroad;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The name of the inspector, inspection location, and date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The nature of each defect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Movement restrictions and safety restrictions, if any;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The destination of the equipment where it will be repaired; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The signature, if possible, as well as the job title and location of the person making the determinations required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Automated tracking system. Automated tracking systems used to meet the tagging requirements contained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may prohibit or revoke a railroad's ability to utilize an automated tracking system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the automated tracking system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA or a railroad's employees, or fails to adequately track or monitor the movement of defective equipment. Such a determination will be made in writing and will state the basis for such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> After a qualified maintenance person or a qualified person verifies that the defective equipment is safe to remain in service as required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the defective equipment that develops a condition not in compliance with this part while en route may continue in passenger service not later than the

next calendar day mechanical inspection, if the requirements of this paragraph are otherwise fully met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Inspection of roller bearings on equipment involved in a derailment. (1) A railroad shall not continue passenger equipment in service that has a roller bearing whose truck was involved in a derailment unless the bearing has been inspected and tested in accordance with the railroad's procedures for handling defective equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The roller bearing shall be disassembled from the axle and inspected internally if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It shows any external sign of damage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It makes any unusual noise when its wheel set is spun freely (an on-track rolling test is acceptable) or when the bearing is manually rotated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Its truck was involved in a derailment at a speed of more than 10 miles per hour; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Its truck was dragged on the ground for more than 100 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special requisites for movement of passenger equipment with safety appliance defects. Consistent with 49 U.S.C. 20303, passenger equipment with a safety appliance not in compliance with this part or with part 231 of this chapter, if applicable, may be moved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If necessary to effect repair of the safety appliance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> From the point where the safety appliance defect was first discovered by the railroad to the nearest available location on the railroad where the necessary repairs required to bring the passenger equipment into compliance can be made or, at the option of the receiving railroad, the equipment may be received and hauled for repair to a point on the receiving railroad's line that is no farther than the point on the delivering railroad's line where the repair of the defect could have been made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a tag placed on both sides of the passenger equipment or an automated tracking system contains the information required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> After notification of the crewmember in charge of the movement of the defective equipment, who in turn shall inform all other crewmembers of the presence of the defective condition(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special Notice for Repair. Nothing in this section authorizes the movement of equipment subject to a Special Notice for Repair under part 216 of this chapter unless the movement is made in accordance with the restrictions contained in the Special Notice.
