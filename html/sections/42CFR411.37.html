If CMS must file suit because the party that  received payment opposes CMS's recovery, the recovery amount is as set  forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery against the primary payer. If CMS seeks recovery from  the primary payer, in accordance with Sec. 411.24(i), the recovery  amount will be no greater than the amount determined under paragraph (c)  or (d) or (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement  amount. If Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement  amount, the recovery is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the ratio of the procurement costs to the total  judgment or settlement payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apply the ratio to the Medicare payment. The product is the  Medicare share of procurement costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subtract the Medicare share of procurement costs from the  Medicare payments. The remainder is the Medicare recovery amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medicare payments equal or exceed the judgment or settlement  amount. If Medicare payments equal or exceed the judgment or settlement  amount, the recovery amount is the total judgment or settlement payment  minus the total procurement costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CMS incurs procurement costs because of opposition to its  recovery. If CMS must bring suit against the party that received payment  because that party opposes CMS's recovery, the recovery amount is the  lower of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medicare payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total judgment or settlement amount, minus the party's total  procurement cost.</p>
