                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of subchapter C of title 50  CFR the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of  surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents  engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within Alaska National Wildlife  Refuges except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by  the Refuge Manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Refuge Manager may restrict or close a route or area to the  use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams or other means of surface  transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged  in subsistence uses if the Refuge Manager determines that such use is  causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and  safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific  values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened  species, or other purposes and values for which the refuge was  established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and  a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as  appropriate. In the case of emergency situations, restrictions or  closures shall not exceed sixty (60) days and shall not be extended  unless the Refuge Manager establishes, after notice and public hearing  in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such  extension is justified according to the factors set forth in paragraph  (b) of this section. Notice of the proposed or emergency restrictions or  closures and the reasons therefor shall be published in at least one  newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one  local newspaper if available, and information about such proposed or  emergency actions shall also be made available for   broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to  inform local rural residents in the affected vicinity. All restrictions  and closures shall be designated on a map which shall be available for  public inspection at the office of the Refuge Manager of the affected  refuge and the post office or postal authority of every affected  community within or near the refuge area, or by the posting of signs in  the vicinity of the restrictions or closures, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface  transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged  in subsistence uses shall be operated (1) in compliance with applicable  State and Federal law, (2) in such a manner as to prevent waste or  damage to the refuge, and (3) in such a manner as to prevent the  herding, harassment, hazing or driving of wildlife for hunting or other  purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At all times when not engaged in subsistence uses, local rural  residents may use snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of  surface transportation in accordance with subpart C of this part.</p>
