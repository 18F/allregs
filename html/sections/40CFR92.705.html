                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When any manufacturer or remanufacturer is notified by the  Administrator that a substantial number of any class or category of  locomotives or locomotive engines, although properly maintained and  used, do not conform to the applicable regulations of this part  (including emission standards or family emission limits), the  manufacturer or remanufacturer shall submit a plan to the Administrator  to remedy such nonconformity. The plan shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of each class or category of locomotive or  locomotive engine to be recalled including the year(s) of manufacture or  remanufacture, the make, the model, the calendar year and such other  information as may be required to identify the locomotives or locomotive  engines to be recalled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the specific modifications, alterations,  repairs, corrections, adjustments or other changes to be made to bring  the locomotives or locomotive engines into conformity, including a brief  summary of the data and technical studies which support the  manufacturer's or remanufacturer's decision as to the particular  remedial changes to be used in correcting the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the method by which the manufacturer or  remanufacturer will determine the names and addresses of locomotive or  locomotive engine owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the proper maintenance or use, if any, upon  which the manufacturer or remanufacturer conditions eligibility for  repair under the remedial plan, an explanation of the manufacturer's or  remanufacturer's reasons for imposing any such condition, and a  description of the proof to be required of a locomotive or locomotive  engine owner to demonstrate compliance with any such condition.  Eligibility may not be denied solely on the basis that the locomotive or  locomotive engine owner used parts not manufactured or remanufactured by  the original locomotive or locomotive engine manufacturer or  remanufacturer, or had repairs not performed by such manufacturer or  remanufacturer. No maintenance or use condition may be imposed unless it  is, in the judgement of the Administrator, demonstrably related to  preventing the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the procedure to be followed by locomotive or  locomotive engine owners to obtain correction of the nonconformity. This  shall include designation of the date on or after which the owner can  have the nonconformity remedied, the time reasonably necessary to  perform the labor required to correct the nonconformity, and the  designation of facilities at which the nonconformity can be remedied:  Provided, That repair shall be completed within a reasonable time  designated by the Administrator from the date the owner first tenders  his locomotive or locomotive engine after the date designated by the  manufacturer or remanufacturer as the date on or after which the owner  can have the nonconformity remedied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If some or all of the nonconforming locomotives or locomotive  engines are to be remedied by persons other than authorized warranty  agents of the manufacturer or remanufacturer, a description of the class  of persons other than authorized warranty agents of the manufacturer or  remanufacturer who will remedy the nonconformity, and a statement  indicating that the participating members of the class will be properly  equipped to perform such remedial action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Three copies of the letters of notification to be sent to  locomotive or locomotive engine owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A description of the system by which the manufacturer or  remanufacturer will assure that an adequate supply of parts will be  available to perform the repair under the remedial plan including the  date by which an adequate supply of parts will be available to initiate  the repair campaign, the percentage of the total parts requirement of  each person who is to perform the repair under the remedial plan to be  shipped to initiate the campaign, and the method to be used to assure  the supply remains both adequate and responsive to owner demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Three copies of all necessary instructions to be sent to those  persons who are to perform the repair under the remedial plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A description of the impact of the changes on fuel consumption,  operability, and safety of each class or category of locomotives or  locomotive engines to be recalled and a brief summary of the data,  technical studies, or engineering evaluations which support these  conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Any other information, reports or data which the Administrator  may reasonably determine is necessary to evaluate the remedial plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification to locomotive or locomotive engine owners shall  be made by first class mail or by such means as approved by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall use all reasonable  means necessary to locate locomotive or locomotive engine owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator reserves the right to require the manufacturer  or remanufacturer to send by certified mail or other reasonable means  subsequent notification to locomotive or locomotive engine owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall require those who  perform the repair under the remedial plan to affix a label to each  locomotive or locomotive engine repaired or, when required, inspected  under the remedial plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label shall be placed in such location as approved by the  Administrator consistent with Federal Railroad Administration  regulations and shall be fabricated of a material suitable for the  location in which it is installed and which is not readily removable  intact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The label shall contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recall campaign number; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A code designating the campaign facility at which the repair,  or inspection for repair was performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator reserves the right to waive any or all of the  requirements of this paragraph (c) if he/she determines that they  constitute an unwarranted burden to the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator may require the manufacturer or remanufacturer  to conduct tests on components and locomotives or locomotive engines  incorporating a change, repair, or modification reasonably designed and  necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the change, repair, or  modification.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 92.705: An interpretive ruling regarding Sec. 92.705 is  published in Appendix II to this part.</p>
