See  section 4221(d)(6) and paragraph (b) of this section for the  circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for  use in further manufacture. See section 6416(b)(3) and Sec. 48.6416(b)- 3 for the circumstances under which credit or refund is available when  tax-paid articles are used in further manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proof of resale for use in further manufacture. See section  4221(b)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section for provisions under which  the exemption provided in section 4221(a)(1) shall cease to apply in the  case of an article sold by the manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to  a second purchaser for use in further manufacture unless the  manufacturer receives timely proof of resale for further manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Circumstances under which an article is considered to have been  sold for use in further manufacture. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An article shall be treated as  sold for use in further manufacture if the article is sold for use by  the buyer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a  component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the  Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An article is used as material in the manufacture or production  of, or as a component of, another article if it is incorporated in, or  is a part or accessory of, the other article when the other article is  sold by the manufacturer. In addition, an article is considered to be  used as material in the manufacture of another article if it is consumed  in whole or in part in testing such other article. However, an article  that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so  that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not  considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of, or as a  component part of, another article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proof of resale for further manufacture--(1) Cessation of  exemption. The exemption provided in section 4221(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and described in  paragraph (a) of this section in respect of an article sold by the  manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser for use by  the second purchaser in further manufacture shall cease to apply on the  first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the  date of the sale of such article by the manufacturer, or the date of  shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier,  unless, within such 6-month period, the manufacturer receives proof, in  the form prescribed by paragraph (c) (2) of this section, that the  article was actually resold by the purchaser to a second purchaser for  such use. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month  period, such proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become  liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made  but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it  on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the  article was actually sold. If the manufacturer later obtains such proof,  it may file a claim for refund or credit of this tax. The payment of  this tax by the manufacturer is not considered an overpayment by the  subsequent manufacturer or producer for which the subsequent  manufacturer or producer is entitled to a credit or refund under section  6416(b)(3). See section 4221(d)(6) and paragraph (b) of this section for   the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold  for use in further manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proof of resale--(i) Certificate of purchaser. The proof of  resale to be received by the manufacturer, as required under section  4221(b)(1), may consist of either a copy of the invoice of the  manufacturer's vendee directed to his purchaser which discloses the  certificate of registry number held by each party or a statement  described below. In the case of an invoice of manufacturer's vendee, it  must appear from such invoice (or by statement attached thereto) that  the article was in fact resold for use in further manufacture. In lieu  of such an invoice, proof of resale may consist of a statement, executed  and signed by the manufacturer's vendee. Such statement shall be in  substantially the following form:</p><p class="depth0">Statement of Manufacturer's Vendee</p><p class="depth0">(To support tax-free sales of taxable articles to a purchaser for  resale to a second purchaser for use in further manufacture (section  4221(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Date)</em> --------------------------, 19----.</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned, or the -------------------------------------- (Name  of manufacturer's vendee if other than undersigned), of which I am ---- ------ (Title), holds certificate of registry No. ----, issued by the  District Director of Internal Revenue at ------------------.</p><p class="depth0">The article or articles specified below or on the reverse side  hereof were purchased tax free by me, or by ---------------------------- ---- (Name of manufacturer's vendee if other than undersigned), on ---- ------ (Date) and were thereafter resold to a purchaser who holds  certificate of registry No. ----, issued by the District Director of  Internal Revenue at ------------------, for use by it as material in the  manufacture or production of, or as a component part or parts of, an  article or articles taxable under chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue  Code, or, if the article or articles are automobile parts or accessories  (to which section 4061(b) applies) or gasoline, for use by it as  material (for nonfuel uses in the case of gasoline) in the manufacture  or production of, or as a component part or parts of, any article or  articles.</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned, or ---------------------------------- (Name of  manufacturer's vendee if other than undersigned), has in my/its  possession proof of tax-free resale of such article or articles in the  form of related purchase orders and sales invoices, and proof of tax- free resale will be retained by me or ---------------------------------- -- (Name of manufacturer's vendee if other than undersigned), for at  least 3 years from the date of this statement, and will be made readily  available for inspection by Government officers during such 3-year  period.</p><p class="depth0">I have not previously executed a statement in respect of such  certificate of resale, and I understand that the fraudulent use of this  statement may subject me and all parties making such fraudulent use of  this statement to a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for  not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Signature)</em> ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Address)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Period covered.
