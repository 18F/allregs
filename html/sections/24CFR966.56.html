                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The hearing shall be held before a hearing officer or hearing  panel, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The complainant shall be afforded a fair hearing, which shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The opportunity to examine before the grievance hearing any PHA  documents, including records and regulations, that are directly relevant  to the hearing. (For a grievance hearing concerning a termination of  tenancy or eviction, see also Sec. 966.4(m).) The tenant shall be  allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. If the PHA  does not make the document available for examination upon request by the  complainant, the PHA may not rely on such document at the grievance  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The right to be represented by counsel or other person chosen as  the tenant's representative, and to have such person make statements on  the tenant's behalf;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The right to a private hearing unless the complainant requests a  public hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The right to present evidence and arguments in support of the  tenant's complaint, to controvert evidence relied on by the PHA or  project management, and to confront and cross-examine all witnesses upon  whose testimony or information the PHA or project management relies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A decision based solely and exclusively upon the facts presented  at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The hearing officer or hearing panel may render a decision  without proceeding with the hearing if the hearing officer or hearing  panel determines that the issue has been previously decided in another  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the complainant or the PHA fails to appear at a scheduled  hearing, the hearing officer or hearing panel may make a determination  to postpone   the hearing for not to exceed five business days or may make a  determination that the party has waived his right to a hearing. Both the  complainant and the PHA shall be notified of the determination by the  hearing officer or hearing panel: Provided, That a determination that  the complainant has waived his right to a hearing shall not constitute a  waiver of any right the complainant may have to contest the PHA's  disposition of the grievance in an appropriate judicial proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At the hearing, the complainant must first make a showing of an  entitlement to the relief sought and thereafter the PHA must sustain the  burden of justifying the PHA action or failure to act against which the  complaint is directed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The hearing shall be conducted informally by the hearing officer  or hearing panel and oral or documentary evidence pertinent to the facts  and issues raised by the complaint may be received without regard to  admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial  proceedings. The hearing officer or hearing panel shall require the PHA,  the complainant, counsel and other participants or spectators to conduct  themselves in an orderly fashion. Failure to comply with the directions  of the hearing officer or hearing panel to obtain order may result in  exclusion from the proceedings or in a decision adverse to the interests  of the disorderly party and granting or denial of the relief sought, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The complainant or the PHA may arrange, in advance and at the  expense of the party making the arrangement, for a transcript of the  hearing. Any interested party may purchase a copy of such transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accommodation of persons with disabilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA must  provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities to  participate in the hearing. Reasonable accommodation may include  qualified sign language interpreters, readers, accessible locations, or  attendants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the tenant is visually impaired, any notice to the tenant  which is required under this subpart must be in an accessible format.
