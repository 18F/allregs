                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law,  debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and  administrative costs as required by this regulation should be collected  in full in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being  collected by administrative offset or by another method, including  voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay  the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular  installments. FMCS will obtain financial statements from debtors who  represent that they are unable to pay the debt in one lump sum. If FMCS  agrees to accept payment in regular installments it will obtain a  legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor which specifies  all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision  accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and  frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to  the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the  installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to  liquidate the Government's claim in not more than 3 years. Installment  payments of less than $50 per month will be accepted only if justifiable  on the grounds of financial hardship or some other reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a  voluntary installment payment is to be applied as among those debts,  that designation must be followed. If the debtor does not designate the  application of the payment, FMCS will apply payments to various debts in  accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined  by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special  attention to applicable statutes of limitations.</p>
