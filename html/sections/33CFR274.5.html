                            <p class="depth0">Under the provisions of Section 4, Pub. L. 92-516, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for Federal certification of pesticide applicators through its development of a single Government Agency Plan (GAP). By letter dated December 30, 1976, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has stated that Federal certification will no longer be undertaken pursuant to a single GAP. The Department of Defense has developed an Agency Plan for certification of its pesticide applicators which has been approved in principle and concept. It has been determined that the DOD Agency Plan satisfies the training requirements for certification of Civil Works personnel. Pending final approval of the DOD Agency Plan, all Corps of Engineers pesticide applicators will be certified in accordance with the criteria described in this regulation by issue of a certificate of training and competency (DA Form 87, 1 Sep 54), signed by the Training Officer and the Division Engineer.</p>
