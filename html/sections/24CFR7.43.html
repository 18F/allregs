                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department shall make reasonable efforts to voluntarily settle complaints of discrimination as early as possible in, and throughout, the administrative processing of complaints, including the pre-complaint counseling stage. These efforts shall include ADR. Any settlement reached shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the claims resolved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be signed by both parties and/or their designees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Otherwise comply with 29 CFR part 1614.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties. Final action that has not been the subject of an appeal or civil action shall be binding on the Department. If the Complainant believes that the Department has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement or decision, the Complainant shall notify the Director of EEO, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of when the Complainant knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. The Complainant may request that the terms of the settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department shall resolve the matter and respond to the Complainant, in writing. If the Department has not responded to the Complainant, in writing, or if the Complainant is not satisfied with the Department's attempt to resolve the matter, the Complainant may appeal to the EEOC for a determination as to whether the Department has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement or final decision. The Complainant may file such an appeal 35 days after the Complainant has served the Department with the allegations of noncompliance, but must file an appeal within 30 days of the Complainant's receipt of the Department's determination. The Complainant must serve a copy of the appeal on the Department and the Department may submit a response to the EEOC within 30 days of receiving notice of the appeal.</p>
