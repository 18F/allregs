                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Relevant factors. In determining whether a submitted redistricting plan has a prohibited purpose or effect the Attorney General, in addition to the factors described above, will consider the following factors (among others):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which malapportioned districts deny or abridge the right to vote of minority citizens;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which minority voting strength is reduced by the proposed redistricting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which minority concentrations are fragmented among different districts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which minorities are over concentrated in one or more districts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which available alternative plans satisfying the jurisdiction's legitimate governmental interests were considered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which the plan departs from objective redistricting criteria set by the submitting jurisdiction, ignores other relevant factors such as compactness and contiguity, or displays a configuration that inexplicably disregards available natural or artificial boundaries; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the plan is inconsistent with the jurisdiction's stated redistricting standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discriminatory purpose. A jurisdiction's failure to adopt the maximum possible number of majority-minority districts may not be the sole basis for determining that a jurisdiction was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.
