                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Questions regarding the application and interpretation of the  rules contained in this part may be referred to the Administrator, who  shall issue an appropriate ruling. Requests for such rulings should be  addressed to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department  of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any interested party may appeal to the Administrative Review  Board for review of a final ruling of the Administrator issued under  paragraph (a) of this section. The petition for review shall be filed  with the Administrative Review Board within 30 calendar days of the date  of the ruling.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to 29 CFR Part 10--Contract Clause</p><p class="depth0">The following clause shall be included by the contracting agency in  every contract, contract-like instrument, and solicitation to which  Executive Order 13658 applies, except for procurement contracts subject  to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Executive Order 13658. This contract is subject to Executive  Order 13658, the regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR  part 10 pursuant to the Executive Order, and the following provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum Wages. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each worker (as defined in 29 CFR 10.2)  engaged in the performance of this contract by the prime contractor or  any subcontractor, regardless of any contractual relationship which may  be alleged to exist between the contractor and worker, shall be paid not  less than the applicable minimum wage under Executive Order 13658.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum wage required to be paid to each worker performing  work on or in connection with this contract between January 1, 2015 and  December 31, 2015 shall be $10.10 per hour. The minimum wage shall be  adjusted each time the Secretary of Labor's annual determination of the  applicable minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658  results in a higher minimum wage. Adjustments to the Executive Order  minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 will be  effective for all workers subject to the Executive Order beginning  January 1 of the following year. If appropriate, the contracting  officer, or other agency official overseeing this contract shall ensure  the contractor is compensated only for the increase in labor costs  resulting from the annual inflation increases in the Executive Order  13658 minimum wage beginning on January 1, 2016. The Secretary of Labor  will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than  90 days before such new wage is to take effect. The Secretary will also  publish the applicable minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor  Web site). The applicable published minimum wage is incorporated by  reference into this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contractor shall pay unconditionally to each worker all  wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as  otherwise provided by 29 CFR 10.23), rebate, or kickback on any account.  Such payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the  end of the regular pay period in which such wages were earned or  accrued. A pay period under this Executive Order may not be of any  duration longer than semi-monthly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The prime contractor and any upper-tier subcontractor shall be  responsible for the compliance by any subcontractor or lower-tier  subcontractor with the Executive Order minimum wage requirements. In the  event of any violation of the minimum wage obligation of this clause,  the contractor and any subcontractor(s) responsible therefore shall be  liable for the unpaid wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the commensurate wage rate paid to a worker on a covered  contract whose wages are calculated pursuant to a special certificate  issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), whether hourly or piece rate, is less  than the Executive Order minimum wage, the contractor must pay the  Executive Order minimum wage rate to achieve compliance with the Order.  If the commensurate wage due under the certificate is greater than the  Executive Order minimum wage, the contractor must pay the 14(c) worker  the greater commensurate wage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withholding. The agency head shall upon its own action or upon  written request of an authorized representative of the Department of  Labor withhold or cause to be withheld from the prime contractor under  this or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, so  much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary  to pay workers the full amount of wages required by Executive Order  13658.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contract Suspension/Contract Termination/Contractor Debarment.  In the event of a failure to pay any worker all or part of the wages due  under Executive Order 13658 or 29 CFR part 10, or a failure to comply  with any other term or condition of Executive Order 13658 or 29 CFR part  10, the contracting agency may on its own action or after authorization  or by direction of the Department of   Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause  suspension of any further payment, advance or guarantee of funds until  such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with  the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the  right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government  may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the  work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost. A  breach of the contract clause may be grounds for debarment as a  contractor and subcontractor as provided in 29 CFR 10.52.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contractor may not discharge any part of its minimum wage  obligation under Executive Order 13658 by furnishing fringe benefits or,  with respect to workers whose wages are governed by the Service Contract  Act, the cash equivalent thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nothing herein shall relieve the contractor of any other  obligation under Federal, State or local law, or under contract, for the  payment of a higher wage to any worker, nor shall a lower prevailing  wage under any such Federal, State, or local law, or under contract,  entitle a contractor to pay less than $10.10 (or the minimum wage as  established each January thereafter) to any worker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (i) through (vi) of this section for each worker and shall make  the records available for inspection and transcription by authorized  representatives of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of  Labor:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, and social security number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The worker's occupation(s) or classification(s)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The rate or rates of wages paid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The number of daily and weekly hours worked by each worker.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any deductions made; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Total wages paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contractor shall also make available a copy of the contract,  as applicable, for inspection or transcription by authorized  representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to make and maintain or to make available such records  for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of 29 CFR part 10  and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce such records,  the contracting officer, upon direction of an authorized representative  of the Department of Labor, or under its own action, shall take such  action as may be necessary to cause suspension of any further payment or  advance of funds until such time as the violations are discontinued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the  Wage and Hour Division to conduct investigations, including interviewing  workers at the worksite during normal working hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing in this clause limits or otherwise modifies the  contractor's payroll and recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the  Davis-Bacon Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations; the  Service Contract Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations; the  Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations;  or any other applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The contractor (as defined in 29 CFR 10.2) shall insert this  clause in all of its covered subcontracts and shall require its  subcontractors to include this clause in any covered lower-tier  subcontracts. The prime contractor and any upper-tier subcontractor  shall be responsible for the compliance by any subcontractor or lower- tier subcontractor with this contract clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Certification of Eligibility. (1) By entering into this  contract, the contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither  it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has an interest in the  contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded  Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed pursuant to  section 5 of the Service Contract Act, section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon  Act, or 29 CFR 5.12(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or  firm whose name appears on the list of persons or firms ineligible to  receive Federal contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the  U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Tipped employees. In paying wages to a tipped employee as  defined in section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.  203(t), the contractor may take a partial credit against the wage  payment obligation (tip credit) to the extent permitted under section  3(a) of Executive Order 13658. In order to take such a tip credit, the  employee must receive an amount of tips at least equal to the amount of  the credit taken; where the tipped employee does not receive sufficient  tips to equal the amount of the tip credit the contractor must increase  the cash wage paid for the workweek so that the amount of cash wage paid  and the tips received by the employee equal the applicable minimum wage  under Executive Order 13658. To utilize this proviso:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer must inform the tipped employee in advance of the  use of the tip credit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer must inform the tipped employee of the amount of  cash wage that will be paid and the additional amount by which the  employee's wages will be considered increased on account of the tip  credit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually  or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer  elects to take a credit for tips received); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer must be able to show by records that the tipped  employee receives at least the applicable Executive Order minimum wage  through the combination of direct wages and tip credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Antiretaliation. It shall be unlawful for any person to  discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any worker because  such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be  instituted any proceeding under or related to Executive Order 13658 or  29 CFR part 10, or has testified or is about to testify in any such  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Disputes concerning labor standards. Disputes related to the  application of Executive Order 13658 to this contract shall not be  subject to the general disputes clause of the contract. Such disputes  shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of  Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 10. Disputes within the meaning of this  contract clause include disputes between the contractor (or any of its  subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of  Labor, or the workers or their representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Notice. The contractor must notify all workers performing work  on or in connection with a covered contract of the applicable minimum  wage rate under the Executive Order. With respect to service employees  on contracts covered by the Service Contract Act and laborers and  mechanics on contracts covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor  may meet this requirement by posting, in a prominent and accessible  place at the worksite, the applicable wage determination under those  statutes. With respect to workers performing work on or in connection  with a covered contract whose wages are governed by the FLSA, the  contractor must post a notice provided by the Department of Labor in a  prominent and accessible place at the worksite so it may be readily seen  by workers. Contractors that customarily post notices to workers  electronically may post the notice electronically provided such  electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is  maintained by the contractor, whether external or internal, and  customarily used for notices to workers about terms and conditions of  employment.</p>
