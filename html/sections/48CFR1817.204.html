This includes agreements (e.g. basic ordering agreements, blanket purchase agreements), interagency acquisitions, and orders placed under agreements or awarded under a Federal Supply Schedule or other indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts awarded by other agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requests for deviations from the 5-year limitation policy shall be sent to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) and shall include justification for exceeding five years. The justification shall discuss planned future assessment of continued performance either prior to exercise of options or at the mid-term of a basic contract with no options. Evidence shall also be included showing that the extended years can be reasonably priced.
