                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for benefits. The former spouse's application for health benefits may be in the form of a Standard Form 2809, letter, or written statement to the employing office. Former spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must also include with their application a request for waiver of the application time limitation in accordance with Sec. 890.805(b) of this part. Former spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part must also include with their application a request for waiver of the application time limitation in accordance with Sec. 890.805(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administration of the enrollment process. (1) The employing office will set up a method for accepting applications for enrollment informing the

former spouse what documents to submit and where to submit them for an eligibility determination, and collecting premium payments. The method will include procedures for verifying the eligibility requirements under Sec. 890.803(a) (1) and (2) of this part. The employing office must obtain OPM, Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System (FSRDS), or CIA Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) documentation that the former spouse meets the additional requirement under Sec. 890.803(a)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this part. A request for the retirement system's determination whether a court order is a qualifying court order for health benefits enrollment under this subpart must be accompanied by the documentation specified in Sec. 838.221, Sec. 838.721, or Sec. 838.1005 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employing office will set up a method for accepting applications for enrollment informing the

When an employing office informs a former spouse of his or her eligibility to enroll, it will identify the documents on which it based its decision and will include a premium payment schedule and statement of the requirements for continued enrollment under Sec. 890.803. If the former spouse does not qualify for health benefits coverage, the employing office must give the former spouse a reconsideration right under Sec. 890.104. Reconsideration requests from former spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must be directed to the Office of Personnel, Retirement Division, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, DC 20505. Reconsideration requests from former spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part must be directed to the Department of State, Retirement Division, Washington, DC 20520.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency employing office will maintain a health benefits file for the former spouse as a file separate from the personnel records of the employee or former employee. The retirement system acting as employing office for the former spouse may file the former spouse health benefits records in with the annuitant's retirement records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The former spouse will be required to certify that he or she meets the requirements listed in Sec. 890.803 and that he or she will notify the employing office within 31 days of an event that results in failure to meet one or more of the requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying court order. Subject to a 31-day extension period for conversion, the duration of health benefits coverage will coincide with any period specified in the qualifying court order providing for an annuity. A court order not meeting the requirements under part 838 of this chapter will not be used to establish or continue entitlement to a former spouse's health benefits coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Premium payments. (1) The former spouse must remit to the employing office the full subscription charge for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in Sec. Sec. 890.401 and 890.807(a)(2). Payment must be made after the pay period in which the former spouse is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing office (see definition of pay period under Sec. 890.101(a)). If the employing office does not receive payment by the due date the employing office must notify the former spouse in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for enrollees residing overseas) after receipt of the notice. If no subsequent payments are made, the employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days (90 days for enrollees residing overseas) after the date of the notice. Termination for nonpayment of premium is considered a voluntary cancellation under Sec. 890.807(d). A former spouse whose enrollment is terminated because of nonpayment of premium may not reenroll or reinstate coverage except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The former spouse must remit to the employing office the full subscription charge for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in Sec.

Such a request must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of termination and must be accompanied by verification that the individual was

prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from paying within the time limit. The employing office will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the individual may request a review of the decision from the employing agency as provided under Sec. 890.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employing office will submit all premium payments collected from former spouses along with its regular health benefits payments to OPM in accordance with procedures established by that Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Withholding from annuity. The retirement system acting as employing office for a former spouse will establish a method for withholding the full subscription charge from the former spouse's annuity check. When the annuity is insufficient to cover the full subscription charge, the retirement system will follow the procedures specified in Sec. 890.806(l).
