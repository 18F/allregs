                            <p class="depth0">EAs should be 1 to 25 pages in length, and will include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Signature (Review and Approval) page.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose and need for the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Description of the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternatives considered. The alternatives considered, including appropriate consideration of the ``No Action'' alternative, the ``Proposed Action,'' and all other appropriate and

reasonable alternatives that can be realistically accomplished. In the discussion of alternatives, any criteria for screening alternatives from full consideration should be presented, and the final disposition of any alternatives that were initially identified should be discussed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Affected environment. This section must address the general conditions and nature of the affected environment and establish the environmental setting against which environmental effects are evaluated. This should include any relevant general baseline conditions focusing on specific aspects of the environment that may be impacted by the alternatives. EBSs and similar real estate or construction environmental baseline documents, or their equivalent, may be incorporated and/or referenced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Environmental consequences. Environmental consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives. The document must state and assess the effects (direct, indirect, and cumulative) of the proposed action and its alternatives on the environment, and what practical mitigation is available to minimize these impacts. Discussion and comparison of impacts should provide sufficient analysis to reach a conclusion regarding the significance of the impacts, and is not merely a quantification of facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conclusions regarding the impacts of the proposed action. A clear statement will be provided regarding whether or not the described impacts are significant. If the EA identifies potential significant impacts associated with the proposed action, the conclusion should clearly state that an EIS will be prepared before the proposed action is implemented. If no significant impacts are associated with the project, the conclusion should state that a FNSI will be prepared. Any mitigations that reduce adverse impacts must be clearly presented. If the EA depends upon mitigations to support a resultant FNSI, these mitigations must be clearly identified as a subsection of the Conclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Listing of preparers, and agencies and persons consulted. Copies of correspondence to and from agencies and persons contacted during the preparation of the EA will be available in the administrative record and may be included in the EA as appendices. In addition, the list of analysts/preparers will be presented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> References. These provide bibliographic information for cited sources. Draft documents should not be cited as references without the expressed permission of the proponent of the draft material.</p>
