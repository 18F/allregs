                                Sec.  1060.137  How must I label and identify the fuel-system
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The requirements of this section apply for manufacturers of fuel- system components subject to emission standards under this part 1060.  However, these requirements do not apply if you produce fuel-system  components that will be covered by a certificate of conformity from  another company under Sec.  1060.601(f). These requirements also do not  apply for components you certify if you also certify the equipment in  which the component is installed and meet the labeling requirements in  Sec.  1060.135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, unless  the components are too small to be properly labeled. Unless we approve  otherwise, we consider parts large enough to be properly labeled if they  have space for 12 characters in six-point font (approximately 2 mm x 12  mm). For these small parts, you may omit the label as long as you  identify those part numbers in your maintenance and installation  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All fuel tanks, except for metal fuel tanks that are deemed  certified under Sec.  1060.103(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel lines. This includes primer bulbs unless they are excluded  from the definition of ``fuel line'' under the standard-setting part.  Label primer bulbs separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carbon canisters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>. Fuel caps must  be labeled if they are separately certified under Sec.  1060.103 or if  the diurnal control system requires that the fuel tank hold pressure.  Fuel caps must also be labeled if they are mounted directly on the fuel  tank, unless the fuel tank is certified based on a worst-case fuel cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Replaceable pressure-relief assemblies. This does not apply if  the component is integral to the fuel tank or fuel cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other components we determine to be critical to the proper  functioning of evaporative emission controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Label your certified fuel-system components at the time of  manufacture. The label must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attached so it is not removable without being destroyed or  defaced. This may involve printing directly on the product. For molded  products, you may use the mold to apply the label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Durable and readable for the equipment's entire life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written in English.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, you must  create the label specified in paragraph (b) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include your corporate name. You may identify another company  instead of yours if you comply with the provisions of Sec.  1054.640.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include EPA's standardized designation for the emission family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State: ``EPA COMPLIANT''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fuel tank labels must identify the FEL, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fuel line labels must identify the applicable permeation level.  This may involve any of the following approaches:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the applicable numerical emission standard (such as 15  g/m \2\/day).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the applicable emission standards using EPA  classifications (such as EPA Nonroad Fuel Lines).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the applicable industry standard specification (such  as SAE J30 R12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fuel line labels must be continuous, with no more than 12 inches  before repeating. We will consider labels to be continuous if the space  between repeating segments is no longer than that of the repeated  information. You may add a continuous stripe or other pattern to help  identify the particular type or grade of your products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may create an abbreviated label for your components. Such a  label may rely on codes to identify the component. The code must at a  minimum identify the certification status, your corporate name, and the  emission family. For example, XYZ Manufacturing may label its fuel lines  as ``EPA-XYZ-A15'' to designate that their ``A15'' family was certified  to meet EPA's 15 g/m \2\/day standard. If you do this, you must describe  the abbreviated label in your application for certification and identify  all the associated information specified in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.
