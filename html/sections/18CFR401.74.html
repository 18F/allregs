In cases involving objections to an allocation of  the assimilative capacity of a stream, wasteload allocation for a point  source, or load allocation for a new point source, the report shall be  signed and verified by a technically qualified person having personal  knowledge of the facts stated therein, and shall include such of the  following items as the Executive Director may require:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A specification with particularity of the ground or grounds for  the objection; and failure to specify a ground for objection prior to  the hearing shall foreclose the objector from thereafter asserting such  a ground at the hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of industrial processing and waste treatment  operational characteristics and outfall configuration in such detail as  to permit an evaluation of the character, kind and quantity of the  discharges, both treated and untreated, including the physical, chemical  and biological properties of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or  other substance composing the discharge in whole or in part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The thermal characteristics of the discharges and the level of  heat in flow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation in depth  of any in-plant control or recovery process for which credit is claimed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The chemical and toxicological characteristics including the  processes and/or indirect discharges which may be the source of the  chemicals or toxicity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An analysis of all the parameters that may have an effect on the  strength of the waste or impinge upon the water quality criteria set  forth in the regulations in this chapter, including a determination of  the rate of biochemical oxygen demand and the projection of a first- stage carbonaceous oxygen demand;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Measurements of the waste as closely as possible to the  processes where the wastes are produced, with the sample composited  either continually or at frequent intervals (one-half hour or, where  permitted by the Executive Director, one hour periods), so as   to represent adequately the strength and volume of waste that is  discharged; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Such other and additional specific technical data as the  Executive Director may reasonably consider necessary and useful for the  proper determination of a wasteload allocation.
