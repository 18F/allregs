                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. Use force measurements to verify the dynamometer's  settings based on coastdown procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform this verification upon initial  installation, within 7 days of testing, and after major maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. This procedure verifies the dynamometer's settings  derived from coastdown testing. For dynamometers that have an automated  process for this procedure, perform this evaluation by setting the  initial speed, final speed, inertial coefficients, and road-load  coefficients as required for each test, using good engineering judgment  to ensure that these values properly represent in-use operation. Use the  following procedure if your dynamometer does not perform this  verification with an automated process:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Warm up the dynamometer as specified by the dynamometer  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the dynamometer in coastdown mode, set the dynamometer  inertia for the smallest vehicle weight that you expect to test and set  A, B, and C road-load coefficients to values typical of those used  during testing. Program the dynamometer to coast down over the  dynamometer operational speed range (typically from a speed of 80 mph  through a minimum speed at or below 10 mph). Perform at least one  coastdown over this speed range, collecting data over each 10 mph  interval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with the  dynamometer inertia and road-load coefficients set for the largest  vehicle weight that you expect to test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine the average coastdown force, F, for each speed and  inertia setting for each of the coastdowns performed using the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19FE15.025  Where:  F = the average force measured during the coastdown for each speed</p><p class="depth3">interval and inertia setting, expressed in lbf [middot] s\2\/</p><p class="depth3">ft and rounded to four significant figures. I = the dynamometer's inertia setting, in lbf [middot] s\2\/ft. vinit = the speed at the start of the coastdown interval,</p><p class="depth3">expressed in ft/s to at least four significant figures. vfinal = the speed at the end of the coastdown interval,</p><p class="depth3">expressed in ft/s to at least four significant figures. t = coastdown time for each speed interval and inertia setting, accurate</p><p class="depth3">to at least 0.01 s.</p><p class="depth3">Example:  I = 2000 lbm = 62.16 lbf [middot] s\2\/ft vinit = 25 mph = 36.66 ft/s vfinal = 15 mph = 22.0 ft/s t = 5.00 s [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19FE15.026     F = 182.2 lbf</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calculate the target value of coastdown force, Fref,  based on the applicable dynamometer parameters for each speed interval  and inertia setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Compare the mean value of the coastdown force measured for each  speed interval and inertia setting, Fact, to the  corresponding Fref to determine values for coastdown force  error, Ferror, using the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.080  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.081</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance evaluation. The coastdown force error determined in  paragraph (c) of this section may not exceed the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR, calculate  Ferrormax for all speed and inertia settings from the  following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.148  Example:  Fref = 192 lbf Ferrormax (%) = (2.2/192) [middot] 100 = 1.14%</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For vehicles above 20,000 pounds GVWR, the maximum allowable  error, Ferrormax, for all speed intervals and inertia  settings is 1.0% or 39.2 N,  whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remedy for nonconforming dynamometers. If the dynamometer is not  able to meet this requirement, diagnose and repair the dynamometer  before continuing with emission testing. Diagnosis should include  performing the verifications in Sec.  1066.255 and Sec.  1066.260.  [79 FR 23823, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9120, Feb. 19, 2015]</p>
