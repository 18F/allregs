                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To obtain Coast Guard approval, each Coastal Service inflatable liferaft must comply with subpart 160.151, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Canopy requirements (IMO LSA Code chapter IV/4.1.1.5, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.051-5 of this subpart)). The canopy may--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be of a type that is furled when the liferaft inflates and that can be set in place by the occupants. A furled canopy must be secured to the buoyancy tubes over 50 percent or more of the liferaft's circumference;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be of an uninsulated, single-ply design; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have an interior of any color.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Viewing port (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.1.5.5). The liferaft need not have the viewing port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rainwater collection (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.1.5.6). The liferaft need not have the means of rainwater collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Capacity (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.2.1). The carrying capacity must be not less than four persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Floor insulation (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.2.2). The floor may be uninsulated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Boarding ramps (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.4.1). The liferaft need be provided with boarding ramps only if the combined cross-section diameter of the buoyancy chambers is greater than 500 mm (19.5 in).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Stability (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.5). Each Coastal Service inflatable liferaft must either meet the stability criteria in Sec. 160.151-17(a) or be fitted with water-containing stability pockets meeting the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total volume of the pockets must be not less than 25 percent of the minimum required volume of the principal buoyancy compartments of the liferaft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pockets must be securely attached and evenly distributed around the periphery of the exterior bottom of the liferaft. They may be omitted at the locations of inflation cylinders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pockets must be designed to deploy underwater when the liferaft inflates. If weights are used for this purpose, they must be of corrosion-resistant material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Lamp (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.3.4). The liferaft need not have the manually controlled interior lamp.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Markings (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.3.6). The words ``COASTAL SERVICE'' must appear on the container, and the type of equipment pack must be identified as ``Coastal Service''. No ``SOLAS'' markings may appear on the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Drop test. The drop test required under paragraph 1/5.1 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.051-5 of this subpart) and 160.151-27(a) may be from a lesser height, if that height is the maximum height of stowage marked on the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Loading and seating test. For the loading and seating test required under paragraph 1/5.7 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing and Sec. 160.151-27(a), the loaded freeboard of the liferaft must be not less than 200 mm (8 in.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Cold-inflation test. The cold-inflation test required under paragraph 1/5.17.3.3.2 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing and Sec. 160.151-27(a) must be conducted at a test temperature of -18 [deg]C (0 [deg]F).
