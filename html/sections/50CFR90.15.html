                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a written application for such grain for use in  preventing crop depredations, the Regional Director shall promptly cause  an investigation to be made, when necessary, to determine whether the  applicant is in fact entitled to have such grain made available for such  purposes. Whenever feasible the required investigation shall be made  jointly by a representative of the game department of the State in which  the affected crops are located and a representative of the Regional  Director. When conducting such investigations, each of the factors set  forth in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section shall be considered  separately. An application for grain shall not be approved if it is  determined that one or more of these factors minimizes the extent of  crop damage or provides another effective method of preventing the  complained of damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The migratory waterfowl committing or threatening to commit crop  damage must be predominantly of a species which are susceptible of being  effectively lured away from the crops by the use of such grain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The crop damage or threatened crop damage must be substantial in  nature (when measured by the extent and potential value of the crops  involved and the number of birds threatening damage); and must affect  growing crops or mature unharvested crops that are in such condition as  to be marketable or have value as feed for livestock or other purposes  of material value to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It must be shown that the damage or threat of damage cannot be  abated through the exercise of any of the privileges granted in permits  authorized by this chapter I to frighten or otherwise herd migratory  waterfowl away from affected crops.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During an open hunting season, it must be shown that the area  affected by crop damage has been and is now open to public hunting and  there has been a clear demonstration that such hunting is ineffective,  and cannot be made effective, to prevent crop damage on such area.</p>
