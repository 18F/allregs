                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided by Sec. 152.46, any modification in the composition, labeling, or packaging of a registered product must be submitted with an application for amended registration. The applicant must submit the information required by Sec. 152.50, as applicable to the change requested. If an application for amended registration is required, the application must be approved by the Agency before the product, as modified, may legally be distributed or sold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In its discretion, the Agency may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waive the requirement for submission of an application for amended registration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require that the applicant certify to the Agency that he has complied with an Agency directive rather than submit an application for amended registration; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permit an applicant to modify a registration by notification or non-notification in accordance with Sec. 152.46.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A registrant may at any time submit identical minor labeling amendments affecting a number of products as a single application if no data are required for EPA to approve the amendment (for example, a change in the wording of a storage statement for designated residential use products). A consolidated application must clearly identify the labeling modification(s) to be made (which must be identical for all products included in the application), list the registration number of each product for which the modification is requested, and provide required supporting materials (for example, labeling) for each affected product.
