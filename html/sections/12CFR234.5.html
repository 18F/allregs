                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the  Dodd-Frank Act. Upon receipt of Board authorization and subject to any  limitations, restrictions, or other requirements established by the  Board, a Federal Reserve Bank may enter into agreements governing the  details of its accounts and services with a designated financial market  utility, consistent with this section and any other applicable Board  direction. The agreements may include, among other things, provisions  regarding documentation to establish the account and receive services,  conditions imposed on the account and services, service charges,  reporting, accounting for activity in the account, liability and duty of  care, and termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Federal Reserve Bank should ensure that its establishment and  maintenance of an account for or provision of services to a designated  financial market utility does not create undue credit, settlement, or  other risk to the Reserve Bank. In order to establish and maintain an  account with a Federal Reserve Bank or receive financial services from a  Federal Reserve Bank, the designated financial market utility must be in  compliance with the Supervisory Agency's regulatory and supervisory  requirements regarding financial resources, liquidity, participant  default management, and other aspects of risk management, as determined  by the Supervisory Agency. In addition, at a minimum, the designated  financial market utility must, in the Federal Reserve Bank's judgment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in generally sound financial condition, including maintenance  of sufficient working capital and cash flow to permit the designated  financial market utility to continue as a going concern and to meet its  current and projected operating expenses under a range of scenarios;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be in compliance with Board orders and policies, Federal Reserve  Bank account agreements and, as applicable, operating circulars, and  other applicable Federal Reserve requirements regarding the  establishment and maintenance of an account at a Federal Reserve Bank  and the receipt of financial services from a Federal Reserve Bank; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have an ongoing ability, including during periods of market  stress or a participant default, to meet all of its obligations under  its agreement for a Federal Reserve Bank account and services, including  by maintaining--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under the  account agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The operational capacity to ensure that such liquid resources  are   available to satisfy the account obligations on a timely basis in  accordance with the account agreement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sound money settlement processes designed to adequately  monitor its Federal Reserve Bank account on an intraday basis, process  money transfers through its account in an orderly manner, and complete  final money settlement no later than the value date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board will consult with the Supervisory Agency of a  designated financial market utility prior to authorizing a Federal  Reserve Bank to open an account, and periodically thereafter, to  ascertain the views of the Supervisory Agency regarding the designated  financial market utility's compliance with the requirements in paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to any right that a Reserve Bank has to limit or  terminate an account or the use of a service pursuant to its account  agreement, the Board may direct the Federal Reserve Bank to impose  limits, restrictions, or other conditions on the availability or use of  a Federal Reserve Bank account or service by a designated financial  market utility, including directing the Reserve Bank to terminate the  use of a particular service or to close the account. If the Reserve Bank  determines that a designated financial market utility no longer complies  with one or more of the minimum conditions in subsection (b), the  Reserve Bank will consult with the Board regarding continued maintenance  of the account and provision of services.
