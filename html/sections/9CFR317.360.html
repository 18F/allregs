Consequently, except as provided in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such  terms unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in  Sec. 317.309(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and  per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a  main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is  generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing  of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an  asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients,  which states: ``Adds a trivial amount of sugar,'' ``adds a negligible  amount of sugar,'' or ``adds a dietarily insignificant amount of  sugar;'' and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It is labeled ``low calorie'' or ``reduced calorie'' or  bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in  compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this  section;

and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The product bears a statement that the product is not ``low  calorie'' or ``calorie reduced'' (unless the product meets the  requirements for a ``low'' or ``reduced calorie'' product) and that  directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further  information on sugar and calorie content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual  statement that a product, including products intended specifically for  infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or  contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains  apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The terms ``reduced sugar,'' ``reduced in sugar,'' ``sugar  reduced,'' ``less sugar,'' ``lower sugar,'' or ``lower in sugar'' may be  used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products  as defined in Sec. 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in  Sec. 317.313(m), provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per  reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference  product as described in Sec. 317.313(j)(1);
