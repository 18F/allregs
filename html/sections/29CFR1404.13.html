The conduct of the arbitration proceeding  is under the arbitrator's jurisdiction and control, and the arbitrator's  decision shall be based upon the evidence and testimony presented at the  hearing or otherwise incorporated in the record of the proceeding. The  arbitrator may, unless prohibited by law, proceed in the absence of any  party who, after due notice, fails to be present or to obtain a  postponement. An award rendered in an ex parte proceeding of this nature  must be based upon evidence presented to the arbitrator.</p>
