                            <p class="depth0">This section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparisons under Sec.  1502.14. It shall consolidate the discussions of those elements required by sections 102(2)(C)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of NEPA which are within the scope of the statement and as much of section 102(2)(C)(iii) as is necessary to support the comparisons. The discussion will include the environmental impacts of the alternatives including the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, the relationship between short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposal should it be implemented. This section should not duplicate discussions in Sec.  1502.14. It shall include discussions of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direct effects and their significance (Sec.  1508.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indirect effects and their significance (Sec.  1508.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Possible conflicts between the proposed action and the objectives of Federal, regional, State, and local (and in the case of a reservation, Indian tribe) land use plans, policies and controls for the area concerned. (See Sec.  1506.2(d).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The environmental effects of alternatives including the proposed action. The comparisons under Sec.  1502.14 will be based on this discussion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts (if not fully covered under Sec.  1502.14(f)).
