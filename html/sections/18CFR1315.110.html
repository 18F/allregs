Unless such person previously filed a certification, and a disclosure form, if required, under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each person shall file a disclosure form at the end of each calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information contained in any disclosure form previously filed by such person under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A change in the officer(s), employee(s), or Member(s) contacted to influence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person who requests or receives from a person referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A subgrant, contract, or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal grant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal loan exceeding $150,000; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal cooperative agreement,
