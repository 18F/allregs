                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance expectations must align with and support the DHS  mission and its strategic goals, organizational program and policy  objectives, annual performance plans, and other measures of performance.  Such expectations include those general performance expectations that  apply to all employees, such as standard operating procedures,  handbooks, or other operating instructions and requirements associated  with the employee's job, unit, or function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supervisors and managers must communicate performance  expectations, including those that may affect an employee's retention in  the job. Performance expectations need not be in writing, but must be  communicated to the employee prior to holding the employee accountable  for them. However, notwithstanding this requirement, employees are  always accountable for demonstrating appropriate standards of conduct,  behavior, and professionalism, such as civility and respect for others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance expectations may take the form of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Goals or objectives that set general or specific performance  targets at the individual, team, and/or organizational level;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organizational, occupational, or other work requirements, such  as standard operating procedures, operating instructions, administrative  manuals, internal rules and directives, and/or other instructions that  are generally applicable and available to the employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A particular work assignment, including expectations regarding  the quality, quantity, accuracy, timeliness, and/or other expected  characteristics of the completed assignment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Competencies an employee is expected to demonstrate on the job,  and/or the contributions an employee is expected to make; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other means, as long as it is reasonable to assume that the  employee will understand the performance that is expected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Supervisors must involve employees, insofar as practicable, in  the development of their performance expectations. However, final  decisions regarding performance expectations are within the sole and  exclusive discretion of management.</p>
