                                Sec. 2634.401  Overview.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 created two types  of qualified trusts, the qualified blind trust and the qualified  diversified trust, that may be used by employees to reduce real or  apparent conflicts of interest. The primary purpose of an executive  branch qualified trust is to confer on an independent trustee and any  other designated fiduciary the sole responsibility to administer the  trust and to manage trust assets without participation by, or the  knowledge of, any interested party or any representative of an  interested party. This responsibility includes the duty to decide when  and to what extent the original assets of the trust are to be sold or  disposed of, and in what investments the proceeds of sale are to be  reinvested. Because the requirements set forth in the Ethics in  Government Act and this regulation assure true ``blindness,'' employees  who have a qualified trust cannot be influenced in the performance of  their official duties by their financial interests in the trust assets.  Their official actions, under these circumstances, should be free from  collateral attack arising out of real or apparent conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. Two characteristics of the qualified trust assure that  true ``blindness'' exists: the independence of the trustee and the  restriction on communications between the independent trustee and the  interested parties. In order to serve as a trustee for an executive  branch qualified trust, an entity must meet the strict requirements for  independence set forth in the Ethics in Government Act and this  regulation. Restrictions on communications also reinforce the  independence of the trustee from the interested parties. During both the  establishment of the trust and the administration of the trust,  communications are limited to certain reports that are required by the  Act and to written communications that are pre-screened by the Office of  Government Ethics. No other communications, even about matters not  connected to the trust, are permitted between the independent trustee  and the interested parties.</p>
