                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section implements the requirements of Section 202 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782) providing for capitalization of the NCUSIF through the maintenance of a deposit by each insured credit union in an amount equaling one percent of its insured shares and payment of an insurance premium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Available assets ratio means the ratio of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount determined by subtracting all liabilities of the NCUSIF, including contingent liabilities for which no provision for losses has been made, from the sum of cash and the market value of unencumbered investments authorized under Section 203(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1783(c)), to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of the insured shares in all insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shown as an abbreviated mathematical formula, the available assets ratio is:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03DE09.000</p><p class="depth2">Equity ratio which shall be calculated using the financial statements of the NCUSIF alone, without any consolidation or combination with the financial statements of any other fund or entity, means the ratio of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of NCUSIF's capitalization, meaning insured credit unions' one percent capitalization deposits plus the retained earnings balance of the NCUSIF (less contingent liabilities for which no provision for losses has been made) to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of the insured shares in all insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shown as an abbreviated mathematical formula, the equity ratio is:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03DE09.001</p><p class="depth4">Insured shares means the total amount of a federally-insured credit union's share, share draft and share certificate accounts, or their equivalent under state law (which may include deposit accounts), authorized to be issued to members, other credit unions, public units, or nonmembers (where permitted under the Act or equivalent state law), but does not include amounts in excess of insurance coverage as provided in part 745 of this chapter. For a credit union or other entity that is not federally insured, ``insured shares'' means, for purposes of this section only, the amount of deposits or shares that would have been insured by the NCUSIF under part 745 had the institution been federally insured on the date of measurement.</p><p class="depth4">Modified premium/distribution ratio means one minus the premium/distribution ratio.</p><p class="depth4">Normal operating level means an equity ratio not less than 1.2 percent and not more than 1.5 percent, as established by action of the NCUA Board.</p><p class="depth4">Premium/distribution ratio means the number of full remaining months in the calendar year following the date of the institution's conversion or merger divided by 12.</p><p class="depth4">Reporting period means calendar year for credit unions with total assets of less than $50,000,000 and means semiannual period for credit union with total assets of $50,000,000 or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> One percent deposit. Each insured credit union must maintain with the NCUSIF during each reporting period a deposit in an amount equaling one percent of the total of the credit union's insured shares at the close of the preceding reporting period. For credit unions with total assets of less than $50,000,000, insured shares will be measured and adjusted annually based on the insured shares reported in the credit union's 5300 report for December 31 of each year. For credit unions with total assets of $50,000,000 or more, insured shares will be measured and adjusted semiannually based on the insured shares reported in the credit union's 5300 reports for December 31 and June 30 of each year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insurance premium charges--(1) In general. Each insured credit union will pay to the NCUSIF, on dates the NCUA Board determines, but not more than twice in any calendar year, an insurance premium in an amount stated as a percentage of insured shares, which will be the same percentage for all insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Each insured credit union will pay to the NCUSIF, on dates the NCUA Board determines, but not more than twice in any calendar year, an insurance premium in an amount stated as a percentage of insured shares, which will be the same percentage for all insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relation of premium charge to equity ratio of NCUSIF. (i) The NCUA Board may assess a premium charge only if the NCUSIF's equity ratio is less than 1.3 percent and the premium charge does not exceed the amount necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.3 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The NCUA Board may assess a premium charge only if the NCUSIF's equity ratio is less than 1.3 percent and the premium charge does not exceed the amount necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.3 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the equity ratio of the NCUSIF falls to between 1.0 and 1.2 percent, the NCUA Board is required to assess a premium in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to at least 1.2 percent, as provided for in the restoration plan adopted under Section 202(c)(2)(D) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(20)(D)). If the equity ratio of the NCUSIF falls below 1.0 percent, the NCUA Board is required to assess a deposit replenishment charge in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.0 percent and to assess a premium charge in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to, at least 1.2 percent, as provided for in the restoration plan adopted under Section 202(c)(2)(D) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(20)(D)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distribution of NCUSIF equity. If, as of the end of a calendar year, the

NCUSIF exceeds its normal operating level and its available assets ratio exceeds 1.0 percent, the NCUA Board will make a proportionate distribution of NCUSIF equity to insured credit unions. The distribution will be the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the NCUSIF's equity ratio below its normal operating level and does not reduce its available assets ratio below 1.0 percent. The distribution will be after the calendar year and in the form determined by the NCUA Board. The form of the distribution may include a waiver of insurance premiums, premium rebates, or distributions from NCUSIF equity in the form of dividends. The NCUA Board will use the aggregate amount of the insured shares from all insured credit unions from the final reporting period of the calendar year in calculating the NCUSIF's equity ratio and available assets ratio for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Invoices. The NCUA provides invoices to all federally insured credit unions stating any change in the amount of a credit union's one percent deposit and the computation and funding of any NCUSIF premium or deposit replenishment assessments due. Invoices for federal credit unions also include any annual operating fees that are due. Invoices are calculated based on a credit union's insured shares as of the most recently ended reporting period. The invoices may also provide for any distribution the NCUA Board declares in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, resulting in a single net transfer of funds between a credit union and the NCUA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> New charters. A newly-chartered credit union that obtains share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year in which it has obtained its charter will not be required to pay an insurance premium for that calendar year. The credit union will fund its one percent deposit on a date to be determined by the NCUA Board in the following calendar year, but will not participate in any distribution from NCUSIF equity related to the period prior to the credit union's funding of its deposit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Depletion of one percent deposit. All or part of the one percent deposit may be used by the NCUSIF if necessary to meet its expenses. The NCUSIF may invoice credit unions in an amount necessary to replenish the one percent deposit at any time following the effective date of the depletion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Conversion to Federal insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A credit union or other institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately fund its one percent deposit based on the total of its insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period prior to the date of conversion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the NCUSIF assesses a premium in the calendar year of conversion, pay a premium based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date times the institution's premium/distribution ratio;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the NCUSIF declares, in the calendar year of conversion on or before the date of conversion, an assessment to replenish the one-percent deposit, pay nothing related to that assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the NCUSIF declares, at any time after the date of conversion through the end of that calendar year, an assessment to replenish the one-percent deposit, pay a replenishment amount based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the NCUSIF declares a distribution in the year following conversion based the NCUSIF's equity at the end of the year of conversion, receive a distribution based on the institution's insured shares as of the end of the year of conversion times the institution's premium/distribution ratio. With regard to distributions declared in the calendar year of conversion but based on the NCUSIF's equity from the end of the preceding year, the converting institution will receive no distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A federally-insured credit union that merges with a nonfederally insured credit union or other nonfederally insured institution (the ``merging institution''), where the federally insured credit union is the continuing institution, will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately on the date of merger increase the amount of its NCUSIF deposit by an amount equal to one percent of the merging institution's insured shares as of the last day of the merging institution's most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With regard to any NCUSIF premiums assessed in the calendar year of merger, pay a two-part premium, with one part calculated on the merging institution's insured shares as described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, and the other part calculated on the continuing institution's insured shares as of the last day of its most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the NCUSIF declares a distribution in the year following the merger based the NCUSIF's equity at the end of the year of merger, receive a distribution based on the continuing institution's insured shares as of the end of the year of merger. With regard to distributions declared in the calendar year of merger but based on the NCUSIF's equity from the end of the preceding year, the institution will receive a distribution based on its insured shares as of the end of the preceding year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Conversion from, or termination of, Federal share insurance. (1) A federally insured credit union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including through a conversion to, or merger into, a nonfederally insured credit union or a noncredit union entity, will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A federally insured credit union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including through a conversion to, or merger into, a nonfederally insured credit union or a noncredit union entity, will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Receive the full amount of its NCUSIF deposit paid, less any amounts applied to cover NCUSIF losses that exceed NCUSIF retained earnings, immediately after the final date on which any shares of the credit union are NCUSIF-insured;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the NCUSIF declares a distribution at the end of the calendar year of conversion, receive a distribution based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of conversion times the institution's modified premium/distribution ratio; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the NCUSIF assesses a premium in the calendar year of conversion or merger on or before the day in which the conversion or merger is completed, pay a premium based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the conversion or merger date times the institution's modified premium/distribution ratio. If the institution has previously paid a premium based on this same assessment that exceeds this amount, the institution will receive a refund of the difference following completion of the conversion or merger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any insolvent credit union that is closed for involuntary liquidation will not be entitled to a return of its deposit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any solvent credit union that is closed due to voluntary or involuntary liquidation will be entitled to a return of its deposit paid, less any amounts applied to cover NCUSIF losses that exceed NCUSIF retained earnings, prior to final distribution of member shares; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Board reserves the right to delay return of the deposit to any credit union converting from or terminating its federal insurance, or voluntarily liquidating, for up to one year if the Board determines that immediate repayment would jeopardize the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Assessment of administrative fee and interest for delinquent payment. Each federally insured credit union must pay to the NCUA an administrative fee, the costs of collection, and interest on any delinquent payment of its capitalization deposit or insurance premium. A payment will be considered delinquent if it is postmarked or electronically posted later than the date stated in the invoice provided to the credit union. The NCUA may waive or abate charges or collection of interest, if circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative fee for a delinquent payment shall be an amount as fixed from time to time by the NCUA Board based upon the administrative costs of such delinquent payments to the NCUA in the preceding year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs of collection shall be calculated as the actual hours expended by NCUA personnel multiplied

by the average hourly cost of the salaries and benefits of such personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The interest rate charged on any delinquent payment shall be the U.S. Department of the Treasury Tax and loan Rate in effect on the date when the loan payment is due as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Act contains specific penalties and other consequences for delinquent payments, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 202(d)(2)(B) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(d)(2)(B)) provides that the Board may assess and collect a penalty from an insured credit union of not more than $20,000 for each day the credit union fails or refuses to pay any deposit or premium due to the fund; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 202(d)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(d)(3)) provides, generally, that no insured credit union shall pay any dividends on its insured shares or distribute any of its assets while it remains in default in the payment of its deposit or any premium charge due to the fund. Section 202(d)(3) further provides that any director or officer of any insured credit union who knowingly participates in the declaration or payment of any such dividend or in any such distribution shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned more than one year, or both.
