                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any  product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the  Director of Customs at the original port of entry where the same is  offered for clearance through Customs inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When product has been identified as ``U.S. refused entry, '' the  inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to  such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee  within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or  consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by  disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the  product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to  animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The  owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal  title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and  immediate exportation, or to an end user, e.g., an animal food  manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes.  ``Refused entry'' product must be delivered to and used by the  manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such  title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be  required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the  notice under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided  during disposition pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except  that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product  from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of  USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not  be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the  product   came into the United States, without the expressed consent of the  Administrator based on full information concerning the product's  disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ``lot'' shall refer to that  product indentified on MP Form 410 in the original request for  inspection for importation pursuant to Sec. 327.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Product which has been refused entry solely because of  misbranding, in lieu of exportation or destruction pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, may be brought into compliance with the  requirements of this part, under supervision of an authorized  representative of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given  by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take  the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for ``refused  entry'' product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by  the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock  workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action  within the time specified under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the  Department will take such action as may be necessary to effectuate its  order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The  Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expense  in the appropriate legal forum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No product which has been refused entry and exported to another  country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to  the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned  to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in  accordance with section 402 of the Act and seizure and condemnation in  accordance with section 403 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a  product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of  the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to  the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under  Sec. 327.7 and subsequently designated ``U.S. Refused Entry'' or found  in any respect not to comply with the requirements in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All charges for storage, cartage, and labor with respect to any  product which was imported contrary to the Act shall be paid by the  owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall constitute a  lien against such product and any other product thereafter imported by  or for such owner or consignee.
