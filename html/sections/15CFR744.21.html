(1) Applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items described in paragraph (a) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) would make a material contribution to the military capabilities of the PRC, Russia, or Venezuela, and would result in advancing the country's military activities contrary to the national security interests of the United States. When it is determined that an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) would make such a contribution, the license will be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items described in paragraph (a) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) would make a material contribution to the military capabilities of the PRC, Russia, or Venezuela, and would result in advancing the country's military activities contrary to the national security interests of the United States.
