                                Sec. 7.105-2  Substantial gainful activity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section defines substantial gainful activity for purposes of section 105(d) and Sec. 7.105-1, prescribes rules for determining whether a taxpayer has the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, and provides examples of the application of the definition and rules in specific factual situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. Substantial gainful activity is the performance of significant duties over a reasonable period of time in work for remuneration or profit (or in work of a type generally performed for remuneration or profit).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rules. (1) Full-time work under competitive circumstances generally indicates ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full-time work under competitive circumstances generally indicates ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Work performed in self-care or the taxpayer's own household tasks, and nonremunerative work performed in connection with hobbies, institutional therapy or training, school attendance, clubs, social programs, and similar activities is not substantial gainful activity. However, the nature of the work performed may be evidence of ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fact that a taxpayer is unemployed for any length of time is not, of itself, conclusive evidence of inability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Regular performance of duties by a taxpayer in a full-time, competitive work situation at a rate of pay at or above the minimum wage will conclusively establish the taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, the minimum wage is the minimum wage prescribed by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Regular performance of duties by a taxpayer in a part-time, competitive work situation at a rate of pay at or above the minimum wage will conclusively establish the taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, if the duties are performed at the employer's convenience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In situations other than those described in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, other factors, such as the nature of the duties performed, may establish a taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of the definition in paragraph (b) of this section and the rules in paragraph (c) of this section in specific factual situations. In examples 1 through 5, the facts establish that the taxpayers are able to engage in substantial gainful activity and, therefore, are not entitled to claim the disability income exclusion of section 105(d). In examples 6 through 9, the facts do not, of themselves, establish the taxpayers' ability or inability to engage in substantial gainful activity. In these situations, all the facts and circumstances must be examined to determine whether the taxpayers are able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). Before retirement on disability, taxpayer worked for a hotel as night desk clerk. After retirement, the taxpayer is hired by another hotel as night desk clerk at a rate of pay exceeding the minimum wage. Since the taxpayer regularly performs duties in a full-time competitive work situation at a rate of pay at or above the minimum wage, he or she is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). A taxpayer who retired on disability from employment as a sales clerk is employed as a full-time babysitter at a rate of pay equal to the minimum wage. Since the taxpayer regularly performs duties in a full-time, competitive work situation at a rate of pay at or above the minimum wage, he or she is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). A taxpayer retired on disability from employment as a teacher because of terminal cancer. The taxpayer's physician recommended continuing employment for therapeutic reasons and taxpayer accepted employment as a part-time teacher at a rate of pay in excess of the minimum wage. The part-time teaching work is done at the employer's convenience. Even though the taxpayer's illness is terminal, the employment was recommended for therapeutic reasons, and the work is part-time, the fact that the work is done at the employer's convenience demonstrates that the taxpayer is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). A taxpayer who retired on disability, is employed full-time in a competitive work situation that is less demanding than his or her former position. The rate of pay exceeds the minimum wage but is about half of the taxpayer's rate of pay in the

former position. It is immaterial that the new work activity is less demanding or less gainful than the work in which the taxpayer was engaged before his or her retirement on disability. Since the taxpayer regularly performs duties in a full-time, competitive work situation at a rate of pay at or above the minimum wage, he or she is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). A taxpayer who retired on disability from employment as a bookkeeper drives trucks for a charitable organization at the taxpayer's convenience. The taxpayer receives no compensation, but duties of this nature generally are performed for remuneration or profit. Some weeks the taxpayer works 10 hours, some weeks 40 hours, and over the year the taxpayer works an average of 20 hours per week. Even though the taxpayer receives no compensation, works part-time, and at his or her convenience, the nature of the duties performed and the average number of hours worked per week conclusively establish the taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (6). A taxpayer who retired on disability was instructed by a doctor that uninterrupted bedrest was vital to the treatment of his or her disability. However, because of financial need, the taxpayer secured new employment in a sedentary job. After attempting the new employment for approximately two months, the taxpayer was physically unable to continue the employment. The fact that the taxpayer attempted to work and did, in fact, work for two months, does not, of itself, conclusively establish the taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (7). A taxpayer who retired on disability accepted employment with a former employer on a trial basis. The purpose of the employment was to determine whether the taxpayer was employable. The trial period continued for an extended period of time and the taxpayer was paid at a rate equal to the minimum wage. However, because of the taxpayer's disability only light duties of a nonproductive make-work nature were assigned. Unless the activity is both substantial and gainful, the taxpayer is not engaged in substantial gainful activity. The activity was gainful because the taxpayer was paid at a rate at or above the minimum wage. However, the activity was not substantial because the duties were of a nonproductive, make-work nature. Accordingly, these facts do not, of themselves, establish the taxpayer's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (8). A taxpayer who retired on disability from employment as a bookkeeper lives with a relative who manages several motel units. The taxpayer assisted the relative for one or two hours a day by performing duties such as washing dishes, answering phones, registering guests, and bookkeeping. The taxpayer can select the times during the day when he or she feels most fit to perform the tasks undertaken. Work of this nature, performed off and on during the day at the taxpayer's convenience, is not activity of a ``substantial and gainful'' nature even if the individual is paid for the work. The performance of these duties does not, of itself, show that the taxpayer is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2">Example (9). A taxpayer who retired on disability because of a physical or mental impairment accepts sheltered employment in a protected environment under an institutional program. Sheltered employment is offered in sheltered workshops, hospitals and similar institutions, homebound programs, and Veterans Administration domiciliaries. Typically, earnings are lower in sheltered employment than in commercial employment. Consequently, impaired workers normally do not seek sheltered employment if other employment is available. The acceptance of sheltered employment by an impaired taxpayer does not necessarily establish his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.
