                            <p class="depth0">The loan note guarantee will not be issued until the lender certifies to the conditions identified in Sec. 4279.181(a) through (o) of subpart B of this part and paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section. If the lender is unable to provide any of the certifications required under this section, the lender must provide an explanation satisfactory to the Agency as to why the lender is unable to provide the certification. The lender can request the guarantee prior to construction, but must still certify to all conditions in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For loans exceeding $150,000, the lender has certified its compliance with the Anti-Lobby Act (18 U.S.C. 1913). Also, if any funds have been, or will be, paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with this commitment providing for the United States to guarantee a loan, the lender shall completely disclose such lobbying activities in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1352.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where applicable, the lender must certify that the borrower has obtained:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Lenders are responsible for ensuring that borrowers have obtained valid, continuous, and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation and maintenance of a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A title opinion or title insurance showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the lender to ensure that the borrower has obtained and recorded such releases, consents, or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of the facility and to provide the required security. For example, when a site is for major structures for utility-type facilities (such as a gas distribution system) and the lender and borrower are able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such site rather than a fee simple title, such a title opinion must be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The minimum financial criteria, including those financial criteria contained in the Conditional Commitment, have been maintained through the issuance of the loan note guarantee. Failure to maintain these financial criteria shall result in an ineligible application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each borrower shall certify to the lender that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of construction work financed in whole or in part with guaranteed loan funds under this subpart shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141 through 3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40 U.S.C. Awards under this subpart are further subject to the relevant regulations contained in title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The lender certifies that it has reviewed all contract documents and verified compliance with Sections 3141 through 3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40 U.S.C., and title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The lender will certify that the same process will be completed for all future contracts and any changes to existing contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The lender certifies that the proposed facility complies with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulatory rules that are in existence and that affect the project, the borrower, or lender activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The lender will notify the Agency in writing whenever there has been a change in the classification of a loan within 15 calendar days of such change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The lender certifies that the borrower has provided the equity in the project identified in the Conditional Commitment.
