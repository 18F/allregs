                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers may generate credits for CO2-reducing  technologies where the CO2 reduction benefit of the  technology is not adequately captured on the Federal Test Procedure and/ or the Highway Fuel Economy Test. These technologies must have a  measurable, demonstrable, and verifiable real-world CO2  reduction that occurs outside the conditions of the Federal Test  Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. These optional credits are  referred to as ``off-cycle'' credits. Off-cycle technologies used to  generate emission credits are considered emission-related components  subject to applicable requirements, and must be demonstrated to be  effective for the full useful life of the vehicle. Unless the  manufacturer demonstrates that the technology is not subject to in-use  deterioration, the manufacturer must account for the deterioration in  their analysis. Durability evaluations of off-cycle technologies may  occur at any time throughout a model year, provided that the results can  be factored into the data provided in the model year report. Off-cycle  credits may not be approved for crash-avoidance technologies, safety  critical systems or systems affecting safety-critical functions, or  technologies designed for the purpose of reducing the frequency of  vehicle crashes. Off-cycle credits may not be earned for technologies  installed on a motor vehicle to attain compliance with any vehicle  safety standard or any regulation set forth in Title 49 of the Code of  Federal Regulations. The manufacturer must use one of the three options  specified in this section to determine the CO2 gram per mile  credit applicable to an off-cycle technology. Note that the option  provided in paragraph (b) of this section applies only to the 2014 and  later model years. The manufacturer should notify EPA in their pre-model  year report of their   intention to generate any credits under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.

To be eligible for this credit, the high  efficiency lighting must be installed in one or more of the following  lighting components: low beam, high beam, parking/position, front and  rear turn signals, front and rear side markers, taillights, backup/ reverse lights, and/or license plate lighting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine idle start-stop means a technology which enables a  vehicle to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle comes to a  rest and restarts the engine when the driver applies pressure to the  accelerator or releases the brake. Off-cycle engine start-stop credits  will only be allowed for a vehicle if the Administrator has made a  determination under the testing and calculation provisions in 40 CFR  Part 600 that engine start-stop is the predominant operating mode for  that vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Solar panels means the external installation of horizontally- oriented solar panels, with direct and unimpeded solar exposure to an  overhead sun, on an electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle,  a fuel cell vehicle, or a hybrid electric vehicle, such that the solar  energy is used to provide energy to the electric drive system of the  vehicle by charging the   battery or directly providing power to the electric motor or to  essential vehicle systems (e.g., cabin heating or cooling/ventilation).  The rated power of the solar panels used to determine the credit value  must be determined under the standard test conditions of 1,000 W/m\2\  direct solar irradiance at a panel temperature of 25 [2 C with an air  mass of 1.5 spectrum (AM1.5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Active transmission warmup means a system that uses waste heat  from the vehicle to quickly warm the transmission fluid to an operating  temperature range using a heat exchanger, increasing the overall  transmission efficiency by reducing parasitic losses associated with the  transmission fluid, such as losses related to friction and fluid  viscosity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Active engine warmup means a system that uses waste heat from  the vehicle to warm up targeted parts of the engine so that it reduces  engine friction losses and enables the closed-loop fuel control more  quickly. It allows a faster transition from cold operation to warm  operation, decreasing CO2 emissions, and increasing fuel  economy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Waste heat recovery means a system that captures heat that  would otherwise be lost through the engine, exhaust system, or the  radiator or other sources and converting that heat to electrical energy  that is used to meet the electrical requirements of the vehicle or used  to augment the warming of other load reduction technologies (e.g., cabin  warming, active engine or transmission warm-up technologies). The amount  of energy recovered is the average value over 5-cycle testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Active seat ventilation means a device which draws air,  pushes or forces air, or otherwise transfers heat from the seating  surface which is in contact with the seat occupant and exhausts it to a  location away from the seat. At a minimum, the driver and front  passenger seat must utilize this technology for a vehicle to be eligible  for credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Solar reflective surface coating means a vehicle paint or other  surface coating which reflects at least 65 percent of the impinging  infrared solar energy, as determined using ASTM standards E903, E1918- 06, or C1549-09 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 86.1). The coating  must be applied at a minimum to all of the approximately horizontal  surfaces of the vehicle that border the passenger and luggage  compartments of the vehicle, (e.g., the rear deck lid and the cabin  roof).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Passive cabin ventilation means ducts, devices, or methods which  utilize convective airflow to move heated air from the cabin interior to  the exterior of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Active cabin ventilation means devices which mechanically move  heated air from the cabin interior to the exterior of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Electric heater circulation system means a system installed in  a vehicle equipped with an engine idle start-stop system that continues  to circulate heated air to the cabin when the engine is stopped during a  stop-start event. This system must be calibrated to keep the engine off  for a minimum of one minute when the external ambient temperature is 30  F and when cabin heating is enabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Technology demonstration using EPA 5-cycle methodology. To  demonstrate an off-cycle technology and to determine a CO2  credit using the EPA 5-cycle methodology, the manufacturer shall  determine the off-cycle city/highway combined carbon-related exhaust  emissions benefit by using the EPA 5-cycle methodology described in 40  CFR Part 600. This method may not be used for technologies that include  elements (e.g., driver-selectable systems) that require additional  analyses, data collection, projections, or modeling, or other  assessments to determine a national average benefit of the technology.  Testing shall be performed on a representative vehicle, selected using  good engineering judgment, for each model type for which the credit is  being demonstrated. The emission benefit of a technology is determined  by testing both with and without the off-cycle technology operating. If  a specific technology is not expected to change emissions on one of the  five test procedures, the manufacturer may submit an engineering  analysis to the EPA that demonstrates that the technology has no effect.  If EPA concurs with the analysis, then multiple tests   are not required using that test procedure; instead, only one of that  test procedure shall be required--either with or without the technology  installed and operating--and that single value will be used for all of  the 5-cycle weighting calculations. Multiple off-cycle technologies may  be demonstrated on a test vehicle. The manufacturer shall conduct the  following steps and submit all test data to the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Testing without the off-cycle technology installed and/or  operating. Determine carbon-related exhaust emissions over the FTP, the  HFET, the US06, the SC03, and the cold temperature FTP test procedures  according to the test procedure provisions specified in 40 CFR part 600  subpart B and using the calculation procedures specified in  Sec. 600.113-12 of this chapter. Run each of these tests a minimum of  three times without the off-cycle technology installed and operating and  average the per phase (bag) results for each test procedure. Calculate  the 5-cycle weighted city/highway combined carbon-related exhaust  emissions from the averaged per phase results, where the 5-cycle city  value is weighted 55% and the 5-cycle highway value is weighted 45%. The  resulting combined city/highway value is the baseline 5-cycle carbon- related exhaust emission value for the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testing with the off-cycle technology installed and/or  operating. Determine carbon-related exhaust emissions over the US06, the  SC03, and the cold temperature FTP test procedures according to the test  procedure provisions specified in 40 CFR part 600 subpart B and using  the calculation procedures specified in Sec. 600.113-12 of this chapter.  Run each of these tests a minimum of three times with the off-cycle  technology installed and operating and average the per phase (bag)  results for each test procedure. Calculate the 5-cycle weighted city/ highway combined carbon-related exhaust emissions from the averaged per  phase results, where the 5-cycle city value is weighted 55% and the 5- cycle highway value is weighted 45%. Use the averaged per phase results  for the FTP and HFET determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for  operation without the off-cycle technology in this calculation. The  resulting combined city/highway value is the 5-cycle carbon-related  exhaust emission value including the off-cycle benefit of the technology  but excluding any benefit of the technology on the FTP and HFET.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subtract the combined city/highway value determined in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section from the value determined in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section and round to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile. The result is the  off-cycle benefit of the technology or technologies being evaluated,  subject to EPA approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Submit all test values to EPA, and include an engineering  analysis describing the technology and how it provides off-cycle  emission benefits. EPA may request additional testing if we determine  that additional testing would be likely to provide significantly greater  confidence in the estimates of off-cycle technology benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Technology demonstration using alternative EPA-approved  methodology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This option may be used only with EPA approval, and the  manufacturer must be able to justify to the Administrator why the 5- cycle option described in paragraph (c) of this section insufficiently  characterizes the effectiveness of the off-cycle technology. In cases  where the EPA 5-cycle methodology described in paragraph (c) of this  section cannot adequately measure the emission reduction attributable to  an off-cycle technology, the manufacturer may develop an alternative  approach. Prior to a model year in which a manufacturer intends to seek  these credits, the manufacturer must submit a detailed analytical plan  to EPA. The manufacturer may seek EPA input on the proposed methodology  prior to conducting testing or analytical work, and EPA will provide  input on the manufacturer's analytical plan. The alternative  demonstration program must be approved in advance by the Administrator  and should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use modeling, on-road testing, on-road data collection, or other  approved analytical or engineering methods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Be robust, verifiable, and capable of demonstrating the real- world emissions benefit with strong statistical significance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Result in a demonstration of baseline and controlled emissions  over a wide range of driving conditions and number of vehicles such that  issues of data uncertainty are minimized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Result in data on a model type basis unless the manufacturer  demonstrates that another basis is appropriate and adequate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice and opportunity for public comment. The Administrator  will publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register notifying  the public of a manufacturer's proposed alternative off-cycle credit  calculation methodology. The notice will include details regarding the  proposed methodology, but will not include any Confidential Business  Information. The notice will include instructions on how to comment on  the methodology. The Administrator will take public comments into  consideration in the final determination, and will notify the public of  the final determination. Credits may not be accrued using an approved  methodology until the first model year for which the Administrator has  issued a final approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> for  the 2017 and later model years, EPA will consult with the U.S.  Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, prior to making a decision on a manufacturer's  application submitted under the requirements of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Review and approval process for off-cycle credits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Initial  steps required. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A manufacturer requesting off-cycle credits under  the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section must conduct the testing  and/or simulation described in that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A manufacturer requesting off-cycle credits under the  provisions of paragraph (d) of this section must develop a methodology  for demonstrating and determining the benefit of the off-cycle  technology, and carry out any necessary testing and analysis required to  support that methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A manufacturer requesting off-cycle credits under paragraphs  (b), (c), or (d) of this section must conduct testing and/or prepare  engineering analyses that demonstrate the in-use durability of the  technology for the full useful life of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data and information requirements.
