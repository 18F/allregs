                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Operators of urban buses in areas described in Sec. 85.1401 shall be in compliance with one of the two programs described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. An operator may switch between programs from year to year only if the operator has been in compliance with all the requirements of the newly chosen program at all times between January 1, 1995 and the date on which the operator chooses to switch programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Program 1: Performance based requirement. Program 1 requires that affected urban buses meet a particulate standard of 0.10 g/bhp-hr effective at time of engine rebuild or replacement and thereafter. The requirement to meet the 0.10 g/bhp-hr standard is automatically waived if no equipment has been certified that meets the 0.10 g/bhp-hr standard and has a life cycle cost of $7,940 or less (in 1992 dollars) for the engine being rebuilt. Program 1 contains fallback requirements for engines for which the 0.10 g/bhp-hr standard is waived. Such urban bus engines must receive equipment that provides a 25 percent reduction in particulate emissions relative to the particulate level of the original engine configuration. This 25 percent reduction requirement is automatically waived if no equipment has been certified for the engine being rebuilt that provides a 25 percent reduction in particulate emissions and has a life cycle cost $2,000 or less (in 1992 dollars). In cases where equipment is not available to either meet a 0.10 g/bhp-hr standard for less than the applicable cost ceiling or achieve a 25 percent reduction for less than the applicable cost ceiling, the urban bus is required to be equipped with an engine rebuilt to the original engine configuration or a configuration certified to have a particulate level lower than that of the original engine configuration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exhaust emissions from any urban bus for which this subpart is applicable shall not exceed a particulate standard of 0.10 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.037 grams per megajoule) if equipment is available for the engine model of such urban bus at time of engine rebuild or engine replacement, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equipment is available for a particular engine model if equipment has been certified to a particulate standard of 0.10 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.037 grams per megajoule), and the equipment for the engine model has been approved for certification for six months or more, and has a life cycle cost as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that does not exceed the life cycle cost ceiling specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The life cycle cost of equipment is equal to the sum of the purchase price, the installation cost, the incremental fuel cost, the cost of any fuel additives required, and the incremental maintenance cost associated with the equipment each as defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(E)

of this section minus an engine replacement credit as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(F) of this section if the equipment replaces an existing engine with a new engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The purchase price is defined as the price at which the equipment (including all parts necessary to install and operate the equipment properly) is offered to the operator. The purchase price excludes reasonable shipping and handling fees and taxes, and equipment costs incurred by the urban bus operator for a standard rebuild.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> The installation cost is defined as the labor cost of installing the equipment on an urban bus engine, incremental to a standard rebuild, based on a labor rate of $35 per hour.
