                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operational criteria for traditional securitizations. A national bank or Federal savings association that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (a) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The exposures are not reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The securitization does not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain an early amortization provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations. For synthetic securitizations, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart the use of a credit

risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must hold risk-based capital under this subpart against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The credit risk mitigant is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Financial collateral; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A guarantee that meets all of the requirements of an eligible guarantee in Sec. 3.2 except for paragraph (3) of the definition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A credit derivative that meets all of the requirements of an eligible credit derivative except for paragraph (3) of the definition of eligible guarantee in Sec. 3.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require the national bank or Federal savings association to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Increase the national bank's or Federal savings association's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Increase the yield payable to parties other than the national bank or Federal savings association in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the national bank or Federal savings association after the inception of the securitization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures. (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to Sec. 3.142(k), if a national bank or Federal savings association is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the securitization exposure. The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the position in relation to regulatory capital according to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to Sec. 3.142(k), if a national bank or Federal savings association is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the securitization exposure.

or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under this section for each securitization exposure.</p>
