                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Presiding Officer shall establish a schedule for  the adjudication and take such other actions as he determines  appropriate to conduct the adjudication in a fair and expeditious  manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prehearing conference. The Presiding Officer, at any time before  a hearing begins, may direct the parties   and their counsel, or other representatives, to appear at a conference  before him to consider, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The settlement of the case;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The simplification of issues and stipulation of facts not in  dispute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exchange of exhibits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Setting a time and place for the hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other matters that may expedite the disposition of the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exchange of witness lists and documents. Unless otherwise  ordered by the Presiding Officer, at least five (5) days before any  prehearing conference, each party shall make available to all other  parties, as appropriate, the names of the expert and other witnesses it  intends to call, together with a brief narrative summary of their  expected testimony, and copies of all documents and exhibits that each  party intends to introduce into evidence. Documents and exhibits shall  be marked for identification as ordered by the Presiding Officer.  Documents that have not been exchanged and witnesses whose names have  not been exchanged shall not be introduced into evidence or allowed to  testify without permission of the Presiding Officer. The Presiding  Officer shall allow the parties reasonable opportunity to review new  evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prehearing conference order. The Presiding Officer shall prepare  an order incorporating any action taken at the conference. The summary  shall incorporate any written stipulations or agreements of the parties  and all rulings and appropriate orders containing directions to the  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative to prehearing conference. If a prehearing conference  is unnecessary or impracticable, the Presiding Officer, on motion or sua  sponte, may direct the parties to make appropriate filings with him to  accomplish any of the objectives set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other discovery. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this  section, further discovery under this section shall be permitted only  upon determination by the Presiding Officer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the  proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the information to be obtained is not otherwise  obtainable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That such information has significant probative value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral  questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative  methods; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is substantial reason to believe that relevant and  probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a  witness at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any party to the proceeding desiring an order to take further  discovery shall make a motion therefor. Such a motion shall set forth:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the  Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted, he shall  issue an order for the taking of such discovery together with the  conditions and terms thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the information sought to be obtained is within the control  of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant  to this paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be  discovered would be adverse to the party from whom the information was  sought, or the issuance of a default order under 820.38.</p>
