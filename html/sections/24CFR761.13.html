                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> PHDEP formula funding--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funding share formula--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Per unit  amount. Subject to the availability of funding, the amount of funding  made available each FFY to an applicant that qualifies for funding in  accordance with Sec. 761.15(a) is based upon the applicant's share of  the total number of units of all applicants that qualify for funding,  with a maximum award of $35 million and a minimum award of $25,000,  except that qualified applicants with less than 50 units will not  receive more than $500 per unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of number of units. For purposes of determining the  number of units counted for purposes of the PHDEP formula, HUD shall  count as one unit each existing rental and Section 23 bond-financed unit  under the ACC. Units that are added to a PHA's inventory will be added  to the overall unit count so long as the units are under ACC amendment  and have reached DOFA by the date HUD establishes for the Federal Fiscal  Year in which the PHDEP formula is being run (hereafter called the  ``reporting date''). Any such increase in units shall result in an  adjustment upwards in the number of units under the PHDEP formula. New  units reaching DOFA after this date will be counted for PHDEP formula  purposes as of the following Federal Fiscal Year. Federalized units that  are eligible for operating subsidy will be counted for PHDEP formula  purposes based on the unit count reflected on the PHA's most recently  approved Operating Budget (Form HUD-52564) and/or subsidy calculation  (Form HUD-52723), or successor form submitted for that program. Units  approved for demolition/disposition continue to be counted for PHDEP  formula funding purposes until actual demolition/disposition of the  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consortium funding. The amount of funding made available to a  consortium will be the total of the amounts that each individual member  would otherwise qualify to receive under the PHDEP funding formula in  accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments to funding. The amount of funding made available  each FFY to an applicant in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)  of this section may be adjusted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An applicant must submit a PHDEP plan that meets the  requirements of Sec. 761.21, as required by Sec. 761.15(a)(5), each  FFY year to receive that FFY's funding. An applicant that does not  submit a PHDEP plan for a FFY as required will not receive that FFY's  funding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ineligible activities, described at Sec. 761.17(b), are not  eligible for funding. Activities proposed for funding in an applicant's  PHDEP plan that are determined to be ineligible will not be funded, and  the applicant's funding for that FFY may be reduced accordingly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In accordance with Sec. 761.15(a)(6), an applicant that does  not meet the performance requirements of Sec. 761.23 will be subject to  the sanctions listed in Sec. 761.30(f)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Both the amount of and continuing eligibility for funding is  subject to the sanctions in Sec. 761.30(f).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any amounts that become available because of adjustments to an  applicant's funding will be distributed to every other applicant that  qualifies for funding in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> AHDEP funding. Information concerning funding made available  under AHDEP for a given FFY will be contained in Notices of Funding  Availability (NOFAs) published in the Federal Register.
