                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fill pipes for fuel tanks must be not less than 40 millimeters (1.5 inches) nominal pipe size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There must be a means of accurately determining the amount of fuel in each fuel tank either by sounding, through a separate sounding pipe or a fill pipe, or by an installed marine type fuel gauge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where sounding pipes are used, each opening must be at least as high as the opening of the fill pipe and they must be kept closed at all times except during sounding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fill pipes and sounding pipes must be so arranged that overflow of liquid or vapor cannot escape to the inside of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fill pipes and sounding pipes must run as directly as possible, preferably in a straight line, from the deck connection to the top of the tank. Such pipes must terminate on the weather deck and must be fitted with shutoff valves, watertight deck plates, or screw caps, suitably marked for identification. Diesel fill pipes and sounding pipes may terminate at the top of the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where a flexible fill pipe section is necessary, suitable flexible tubing or hose having high resistance to salt water, petroleum oils, heat and vibration, may be used. Such hose must overlap metallic pipe ends at least 1.5 times the pipe diameter and must be secured at each end by clamps. The flexible section must be accessible and as near the upper end of the fill pipe as practicable. When the flexible section is a nonconductor of electricity, the

metallic sections of the fill pipe separated thereby must be joined by a conductor for protection against generation of a static charge when filling with fuel.
