                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A cable operator (or other interested party) may file a petition for a determination of effective competition with the Commission pursuant to the Commission's procedural rules in Sec.  76.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the cable operator seeks to demonstrate that effective competition as defined in Sec.  76.905(b)(1), (3), or (4) exists in the franchise area, it bears the burden of demonstrating the presence of such effective competition. Effective competition as defined in Sec.  76.905(b)(2) is governed by the presumption in Sec.  76.906, except that where a franchising authority has rebutted the presumption of competing provider effective competition as defined in Sec.  76.905(b)(2) and is certified, the cable operator must demonstrate that circumstances have changed and effective competition is present in the franchise area.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (b): The criteria for determining effective competition pursuant to Sec.  76.905(b)(4) are described in Implementation of Cable Act Reform Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Report and Order in CS Docket No. 96-85, FCC 99-57 (released March 29, 1999).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the evidence establishing effective competition is not otherwise available, cable operators may request from a competitor information regarding the competitor's reach and number of subscribers. A competitor must respond to such request within 15 days. Such responses may be limited to numerical totals. In addition, with respect to petitions filed seeking to demonstrate the presence of effective competition pursuant to Sec.  76.905(b)(4), the Commission may issue an order directing one or more persons to produce information relevant to the petition's disposition.
