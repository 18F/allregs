DO samples shall be collected on  consecutive normal production shifts or normal production shifts each of  which is worked on consecutive days. The bimonthly periods are: January 1-February 28 (29) March 1-April 30 May 1-June 30 July 1-August 31 September 1-October 31 November 1-December 31</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(10)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conventional section using cutting machine.

On the loading  machine operator or on the loading machine within 36 inches inby the  normal working position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuous mining section other than auger-type. On the  continuous mining machine operator or on the continuous mining machine  within 36 inches inby the normal working position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Continuous mining machine; auger-type.
