                            <p class="depth0">An employee who is ``employed by'' a radio or television station in one or more of the named occupations may perform his work at the station or away from the station so long as his activities meet the requirements for exemption.


Sec. 793.16  ``Radio or television station.''</p><p class="depth0">The employee must be employed by a ``radio or television station.'' A radio or television station is one which is designated and licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission.


Sec. 793.17  ``Major studio.''</p><p class="depth0">The exemption further depends on whether ``the major studio'' of the radio or television station which employes the employee is in a city or town as defined in section 13(b)(9). The location of secondary studios of the radio or television station is immaterial. It is the location of the ``major'' studio that determines the qualification of the employer for the exemption. A major studio for purposes of the exemption is the main studio of the radio or television station as designated on the station's license by the Federal Communications Commission. It is this major studio which must be located in the city or town as defined in section 13(b)(9) of the Act.</p>
