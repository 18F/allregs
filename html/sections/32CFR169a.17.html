                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Every effort must be made to avoid postponement or cancellation  of CA solicitations even if there are significant changes, omissions, or  defects in the Government's in-house cost estimate. Such corrections  shall be made before the expiration of bids or proposals and may require  the extensions of bids or proposals. When there is no alternative,  contracting officers must clearly document the reason(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bidders or offerers shall be informed that an in-house cost  estimate is being developed and that a contract may or may not result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Bids or proposals shall be on at least a 3-year multi-year basis  (when appropriate) or shall include prepriced renewal options to cover 2  fiscal years after the initial period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> All contracts awarded as a result of a conversion (whether or  not a cost comparison was performed) shall comply with all requirements  of the FAR and DFARS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Solicitations shall be restricted for preferential procurement  when the requirements applicable to such programs (such as, small  business set-asides or other required sources of supplies and services)  are met, in accordance with the FAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Solicitations will not be restricted for preferential  procurement unless the contracting officer determines that there is a  reasonable expectation that the commercial prices will be fair and  reasonable, in accordance with the FAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Contract defaults may result in temporary performance by  Government personnel or other suitable means; such as, an interim  contract source. Personnel detailed to such a temporary assignment  should be clearly informed that they will return to their permanent  assignment when a new contract is awarded. If the default occurs within  the first year of contract performance, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Government was the next lowest bidder/offerer, and in- house performance is still feasible, the function may be returned to in- house performance. If in-house performance is no longer feasible, the  contracting officer shall obtain the requirement by contract in  accordance with the requirements of the FAR, 48 CFR part 49. A return to  in-house performance under the above criteria shall be approved by the  DoD Component's central point of contact office. This authority may not  be redelegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the contract wage rates are no longer valid or if the  contracting officer, after a review of the availability of the next  lowest responsible and responsive bidders/offerers, determines that  resolicitation is appropriate, the Government may submit a bid for  comparison with other bids/offers from the private sector. Submission of  a Government bid requires a determination by the DoD Component that  performance by DoD employees is still feasible and that a likelihood  exists that such performance may be more economical than performance by  contract. In such cost comparisons, the conversion differentials will  not be applied to the costs of either in-house or contract performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If contract default occurs during the second or subsequent year  of contract performance, the procedures of Sec. 169a.8(b)(2)(i) of this  part apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Grouping of Commercial Activities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The installation  commander shall determine carefully which CAs should be grouped in a  single solicitation. The installation commander should keep in mind that  the grouping of commercial activities can influence the amount of  competition (number of commercial firms that will bid or submit  proposals) and the eventual cost to the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The installation commander shall consider the adverse impacts  that the grouping of commercial activities into a single solicitation  may have on small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Commercial  activities being performed wholly by small or small disadvantaged  businesses will not be incorporated into a cost comparison unless  consolidation is necessary to meet   mission requirements. Actions must be taken to ensure that such  contractors are not displaced merely to accomplish consolidation.  Similarly, care must be taken so that nonincumbent small and small  disadvantaged business contractors are not handicapped or prejudiced  unduly from competing effectively at the prime contractor level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In developing solicitations for commercial activities, the  procurement plan should reflect an analysis of the advantages and  disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than  one award. The decision to group commercial activities should reflect an  analysis of all relevant factors including the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The effect on competition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The duplicative management functions and costs to be eliminated  through grouping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The economies of administering multifunction vs. single function  contracts, including cost risks associated with the pricing structure of  each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The feasibility of separating unrelated functional tasks or  groupings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The effect grouping will have on the performance of the  functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When the solicitation package includes totally independent  functions which are clearly divisible, severable, limited in number, and  not price interrelated, they shall be solicited on the basis of an ``any  or all'' bid or offer. Commerical bidders or offerors shall be permitted  to submit bids or offers on one or any combination of the functions  being solicited. These bids or offers shall be evaluated to determine  the lowest aggregate contract cost to the Government. This lowest  aggregate contract cost then will be compared to the in-house cost  estimate based on the MEO for performance of the functions in the single  solicitation. The procedures in part IV of the Supplement to OMB  Circular No. A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> There are instances when this approach to contracting for CAs  may not apply; such as, situations when physical limitations of site  (where the activities are to be performed) preclude allowing more than  one contractor to perform, when the function cannot be divided for  purposes of performance accountability, or for other national security  considerations. However, if an ``all or none'' solicitation is issued,  the decision to do so must include a cost analysis to reflect that the  ``all or none'' solicitation is less costly to the Government or an  analysis indicating it is otherwise in the best interest of the  Government, all factors considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> It is recognized that in some cases, decisions will result in  the elimination of prime contracting opportunities for small business.  In such cases special measures shall be taken. At a minimum, small and  small disadvantaged business concerns shall be given preferential  consideration by all competing prime contractors in the award of  subcontracts. For negotiated procurements the degree to which this is  accomplished will be a weighted factor in the evaluation and source  selection process leading to contract award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The contract files shall be documented fully to demonstrate  compliance with these procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If no bids or proposals, or no responsive or responsible bids or  proposals are received in response to a solicitation, the in-house cost  estimate shall remain unopened. The contracting officer shall examine  the solicitation to ascertain why no responses were received. Depending  on the results of this review, the contracting officer shall consider  restructuring the requirement, if feasible and reissue it under  restricted or unrestricted solicitation procedures, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Continuation of an in-house CA for lack of a satisfactory  commercial source will not be based upon lack of response to a  restricted solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The guidance of subparagraph E.3.f. applies to sumplified cost  comparisons and direct conversions of military personnel CAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> To ensure that bonds and/or insurance requirements are being  used in the best interest of the Government, as a general rule,  requirements (for other than construction related services) above the  levels established in the FAR and DFARS should not be included in  acquisitions.
