                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart E establishes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum qualifying criteria for national banks or Federal savings associations using institution-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Methodologies for such national banks or Federal savings associations to calculate their total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) This subpart applies to a national bank or Federal savings association that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart applies to a national bank or Federal savings association that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has consolidated total assets, as reported on its most recent year-end Call Report equal to $250 billion or more;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure on its most recent year-end Call Report equal to $10 billion or more (where total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total cross-border claims less claims with a head office or guarantor located in another country plus redistributed guaranteed amounts to the country of head office or guarantor plus local country claims on local residents plus revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products, calculated in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Country Exposure Report);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to subpart E of 12 CFR part 3 (OCC), 12 CFR part 217 (Board), or 12 CFR part 325 (FDIC) to calculate its total risk-weighted assets;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its total risk-weighted assets; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Elects to use this subpart to calculate its total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A national bank or Federal savings association that is subject to this subpart shall remain subject to this subpart unless the OCC determines in writing that application of this subpart is not appropriate in light of the national bank's or Federal savings association's asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or scope of operations. In making a determination under this paragraph (b), the OCC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 3.404.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A market risk national bank or Federal savings association must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Principle of conservatism. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to

apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the OCC that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association notifies the OCC in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the national bank or Federal savings association.</p>
