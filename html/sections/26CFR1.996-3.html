For purposes of sections 991 through 997, the earnings and profits of a DISC, or former DISC, shall be treated as composed of the following three divisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accumulated DISC income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Previously taxed income (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other earnings and profits (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accumulated DISC income defined.

For example, the earnings and profits of a DISC for a taxable year include any amounts includible in such DISC's gross income pursuant to section 951(a) (relating to controlled foreign corporations).

R Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X Corporation is its sole shareholder. At the beginning of 1974, R has a deficit in earnings and profits of $60 all of which is composed of ``other earnings and profits''. For 1974, R has earnings and profits of $80 before reduction for any distributions and taxable income of $70. On June 15, 1974, R makes a cash distribution to X of $60, with respect to its stock, to which section 301 applies. On August 15, 1974, R makes a cash distribution to X of $30 designated as a distribution to meet qualification requirements pursuant to Sec. 1.992-3. Under Sec. 1.995-2(a), X is deemed to receive, on December 31, 1974, a distribution of a dividend of $35, i.e., one-half of R's taxable income of $70. The tax consequences of these facts to X and their effect on R's earnings and profits are set forth in the subsequent subparagraphs of this example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividend treatment of actual distributions. Since R had $80 of earnings and profits for 1974 and a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of 1974, only $80 of the actual distributions ($90) are treated as dividends under sections 301(c)(1) and 316(a)(2). ($10 of the actual distribution, which is not treated as a dividend is treated in the manner specified in section 301(c) (2) and (3).) Thus, under Sec. 1.316-2(b), $26.67 of the actual qualifying distribution made on August 15, 1974 ($30x $80/$90), and $53.33 of the actual distribution made on June 15, 1974 ($60x$80/$90), are considered made out of earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priority of distributions. Under Sec. 1.996-1(d), for purposes of adjusting the divisions of R's earnings and profits and determining the treatment of subsequent distributions,

the sequence in which each distribution is treated as having been made is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First, the deemed distribution of $35,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, the actual qualifying distribution of $30 made on August 15, 1974, pursuant to Sec. 1.992-3, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Finally, the actual distribution of $60 made on June 15, 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment and effect of deemed distribution. Under Sec. 1.995-2(a), on December 31, 1974, X includes the deemed distribution of $35 in its gross income as a dividend. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, R's previously taxed income is increased by $35 as shown on line (3) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section, accumulated DISC income is increased by $45 of DISC income, i.e., R's earnings and profits for 1974, $80, minus the deemed distribution of $35, as shown on line (4) of the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment and effect of actual qualifying distribution of $30. As indicated in subparagraph (2) of this example, $26.67 of the $30 qualifying distribution on August 15, 1974, is treated as made out of earnings and profits for 1974. Under Sec. 1.996-1(b)(1)(i), the entire $26.67 is treated as distributed out of accumulated DISC income. Thus, on August 15, 1974, X includes $26.67 in its gross income as a dividend. No deduction is allowable under section 243. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, R's accumulated DISC income is reduced by $26.67 as shown on line (6) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Treatment and effect of actual distribution of $60. As indicated in subparagraph (2) of this example, $53.33 of the $60 distribution on June 15, 1974, is treated as made out of earnings and profits for 1974. Under Sec. 1.996-1(a), the $53.33 is treated as distributed out of previously taxed income to the extent thereof, $35, and then out of accumulated DISC income, $18.33. Thus, on June 15, 1974, X includes $18.33 in its gross income as a dividend. Under Sec. 1.996-1(c), the distribution of $35 out of previously taxed income is excluded from gross income. No deduction is allowable under section 243 with respect to the actual distribution of $53.33. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, accumulated DISC income is reduced by $18.33 and, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, previously taxed income is reduced by $35, as shown on line (7) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Summary.

Assume the facts are the same as in example 5, except that at the beginning of 1974 R's accumulated earnings and profits amount to $60 consisting of accumulated DISC income of $20, previously taxed income of $10, and other earnings and profits of $30. In addition, on August 1, 1974, X transfers all R's stock to Y Corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) in which under section 354 X recognizes no gain or loss. Under these facts, X includes in its gross income for 1974 a dividend of $15 which is attributable to the actual distribution of $60 paid out of earnings and profits on June 15, 1974. X excludes from gross income the balance of the $60 distribution ($45) paid out of earnings and profits because, under Sec. 1.996-1(a), it is treated as paid out of previously taxed income. Y includes in its gross income for 1974 a dividend of $65 of which $35 is attributable to the deemed distribution of a dividend to Y on December 31, 1974, under Sec. 1.995-2(a) and $30 is attributable to the qualifying distribution paid out of earnings and profits to Y on August 15, 1974. The adjustments to R's earnings and profits are summarized in the following table:

In the case of a DISC having one or more corporate shareholders but less than all of its shareholders subject to the special rules of section 291(a)(4), relating to certain deferred DISC income as a corporate preference item, accumulated DISC income and previously taxed income of the DISC are divided between the corporate shareholders, as a class, and the other shareholders, as a class, in proportion to amounts of DISC income not deemed distributed and amounts deemed distributed to each class. Subsequent taxation of actual and qualifying distributions shall be based upon this division. Thus, if a DISC is owned 50 percent by corporate shareholders and 50 percent by individual shareholders and has undistributed taxable income of $2,000 for its year, the division is made as follows:
Corporate shareholders:</p><p class="depth0">Previously taxed income (57.5% of $2,000/2)............         $575</p><p class="depth0">Accumulated DISC income (42.5% of $2,000/2)............          425Individual shareholders:</p><p class="depth0">Previously taxed income (50% of $2,000/2)..............          500</p><p class="depth0">Accumulated DISC income (50% of $2,000/2)..............          500</p><p class="depth0">(Secs. 995(e)(7), (8) and (10), 995(g) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (90 Stat. 1655, 26 U.S.C. 995 (e)(7), (8) and (10); 90 Stat. 1659, 26 U.S.C. 995(g); and 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805))
