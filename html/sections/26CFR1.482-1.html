                                Sec. 1.482-1  Allocation of income and deductions among taxpayers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of section 482 is  to ensure that taxpayers clearly reflect income attributable to  controlled transactions and to prevent the avoidance of taxes with  respect to such transactions. Section 482 places a controlled taxpayer  on a tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer by determining the true  taxable income of the controlled taxpayer. This section sets forth  general principles and guidelines to be followed under section 482.  Section 1.482-2 provides rules for the determination of the true taxable  income of controlled taxpayers in specific situations, including  controlled transactions involving loans or advances or the use of  tangible property. Sections 1.482-3 through 1.482-6 provide rules for  the determination of the true taxable income of controlled taxpayers in  cases involving the transfer of property. Section 1.482-7T sets forth  the cost sharing provisions applicable to taxable years beginning on or  after January 5, 2009. Section 1.482-8 provides examples illustrating  the application of the best method rule. Finally, Sec. 1.482-9 provides  rules for the determination of the true taxable income of controlled  taxpayers in cases involving the performance of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authority to make allocations. The district director may make  allocations between or among the members of a controlled group if a  controlled taxpayer has not reported its true taxable income. In such  case, the district director may allocate income, deductions, credits,  allowances, basis, or any other item or element affecting taxable income  (referred to as allocations). The appropriate allocation may take the  form of an increase or decrease in any relevant amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayer's use of section 482. If necessary to reflect an arm's  length result, a controlled taxpayer may report on a timely filed U.S.  income tax return (including extensions) the results of its controlled  transactions based upon prices different from those actually charged.  Except as provided in this paragraph, section 482 grants no other right  to a controlled taxpayer to apply the provisions of section 482 at will  or to compel the district director to apply such provisions. Therefore,  no untimely or amended returns will be permitted to decrease taxable  income based on allocations or other adjustments with respect to  controlled transactions. See Sec. 1.6662-6T(a)(2) or successor  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Arm's length standard--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In determining the true  taxable income of a controlled taxpayer, the standard to be applied in  every case is that of a taxpayer dealing at arm's length with an  uncontrolled taxpayer. A controlled transaction meets the arm's length  standard if the results of the transaction are consistent with the  results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had  engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances (arm's  length result). However, because identical transactions can rarely be  located, whether a transaction produces an arm's length result generally  will be determined by reference to the results of comparable  transactions under comparable circumstances. See Sec. 1.482-1(d)(2)  (Standard of comparability). Evaluation of whether a controlled  transaction produces an arm's length result is made pursuant to a method  selected under the best method rule described in Sec. 1.482-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Arm's length methods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Methods. Sections 1.482-2 through  1.482-7 and 1.482-9 provide specific methods to be used to evaluate  whether transactions between or among members of the controlled group  satisfy the arm's length standard, and if they do not, to determine the  arm's length result. This section provides general principles applicable  in determining arm's length results of such controlled transactions, but  do not provide methods, for which reference must be made to those other  sections in accordance with paragraphs   (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. Section 1.482-7 provides the  specific methods to be used to evaluate whether a cost sharing  arrangement as defined in Sec. 1.482-7 produces results consistent with  an arm's length result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selection of category of method applicable to transaction. The  methods listed in Sec. 1.482-2 apply to different types of transactions,  such as transfers of property, services, loans or advances, and rentals.  Accordingly, the method or methods most appropriate to the calculation  of arm's length results for controlled transactions must be selected,  and different methods may be applied to interrelated transactions if  such transactions are most reliably evaluated on a separate basis. For  example, if services are provided in connection with the transfer of  property, it may be appropriate to separately apply the methods  applicable to services and property in order to determine an arm's  length result. But see Sec. 1.482-1(f)(2)(i) (Aggregation of  transactions). In addition, other applicable provisions of the Code may  affect the characterization of a transaction, and therefore affect the  methods applicable under section 482. See for example section 467.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Coordination of methods applicable to certain intangible  development arrangements. Section 1.482-7 provides the specific methods  to be used to determine arm's length results of controlled transactions  in connection with a cost sharing arrangement as defined in Sec. 1.482- 7. Sections 1.482-4 and 1.482-9, as appropriate, provide the specific  methods to be used to determine arm's length results of arrangements,  including partnerships, for sharing the costs and risks of developing  intangibles, other than a cost sharing arrangement covered by  Sec. 1.482-7. See also Secs. 1.482-4(g) (Coordination with rules  governing cost sharing arrangements) and 1.482-9(m)(3) (Coordination  with rules governing cost sharing arrangements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Best method rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The arm's length result of a  controlled transaction must be determined under the method that, under  the facts and circumstances, provides the most reliable measure of an  arm's length result. Thus, there is no strict priority of methods, and  no method will invariably be considered to be more reliable than others.  An arm's length result may be determined under any method without  establishing the inapplicability of another method, but if another  method subsequently is shown to produce a more reliable measure of an  arm's length result, such other method must be used. Similarly, if two  or more applications of a single method provide inconsistent results,  the arm's length result must be determined under the application that,  under the facts and circumstances, provides the most reliable measure of  an arm's length result. See Sec. 1.482-8 for examples of the application  of the best method rule. See Sec. 1.482-7 for the applicable methods in  the case of a cost sharing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>, (ii), and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Comparability. The relative reliability of a method based on the  results of transactions between unrelated parties depends on the degree  of comparability between the controlled transaction or taxpayers and the  uncontrolled comparables, taking into account the factors described in  Sec. 1.482-1(d)(3) (Factors for determining comparability), and after  making adjustments for differences, as described in Sec. 1.482-1(d)(2)  (Standard of comparability). As the degree of comparability increases,  the number and extent of potential differences that could render the  analysis inaccurate is reduced. In addition, if adjustments are   made to increase the degree of comparability, the number, magnitude, and  reliability of those adjustments will affect the reliability of the  results of the analysis. Thus, an analysis under the comparable  uncontrolled price method will generally be more reliable than analyses  obtained under other methods if the analysis is based on closely  comparable uncontrolled transactions, because such an analysis can be  expected to achieve a higher degree of comparability and be susceptible  to fewer differences than analyses under other methods. See Sec. 1.482- 3(b)(2)(ii)(A). An analysis will be relatively less reliable, however,  as the uncontrolled transactions become less comparable to the  controlled transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (A), (B), and (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Completeness and accuracy of data. The completeness and accuracy  of the data affects the ability to identify and quantify those factors  that would affect the result under any particular method. For example,  the completeness and accuracy of data will determine the extent to which  it is possible to identify differences between the controlled and  uncontrolled transactions, and the reliability of adjustments that are  made to account for such differences. An analysis will be relatively  more reliable as the completeness and accuracy of the data increases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reliability of assumptions. All methods rely on certain  assumptions. The reliability of the results derived from a method  depends on the soundness of such assumptions. Some assumptions are  relatively reliable. For example, adjustments for differences in payment  terms between controlled and uncontrolled transactions may be based on  the assumption that at arm's length such differences would lead to price  differences that reflect the time value of money. Although selection of  the appropriate interest rate to use in making such adjustments involves  some judgement, the economic analysis on which the assumption is based  is relatively sound. Other assumptions may be less reliable. For  example, the residual profit split method may be based on the assumption  that capitalized intangible development expenses reflect the relative  value of the intangible property contributed by each party. Because the  costs of developing an intangible may not be related to its market  value, the soundness of this assumption will affect the reliability of  the results derived from this method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sensitivity of results to deficiencies in data and assumptions.  Deficiencies in the data used or assumptions made may have a greater  effect on some methods than others. In particular, the reliability of  some methods is heavily dependent on the similarity of property or  services involved in the controlled and uncontrolled transaction. For  certain other methods, such as the resale price method, the analysis of  the extent to which controlled and uncontrolled taxpayers undertake the  same or similar functions, employ similar resources, and bear similar  risks is particularly important. Finally, under other methods, such as  the profit split method, defining the relevant business activity and  appropriate allocation of costs, income, and assets may be of particular  importance. Therefore, a difference between the controlled and  uncontrolled transactions for which an accurate adjustment cannot be  made may have a greater effect on the reliability of the results derived  under one method than the results derived under another method. For  example, differences in management efficiency may have a greater effect  on a comparable profits method analysis than on a comparable  uncontrolled price method analysis, while differences in product  characteristics will ordinarily have a greater effect on a comparable  uncontrolled price method analysis than on a comparable profits method  analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Confirmation of results by another method. If two or more  methods produce inconsistent results, the best   method rule will be applied to select the method that provides the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result. If the best method rule does  not clearly indicate which method should be selected, an additional  factor that may be taken into account in selecting a method is whether  any of the competing methods produce results that are consistent with  the results obtained from the appropriate application of another method.  Further, in evaluating different applications of the same method, the  fact that a second method (or another application of the first method)  produces results that are consistent with one of the competing  applications may be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Comparability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Whether a controlled transaction  produces an arm's length result is generally evaluated by comparing the  results of that transaction to results realized by uncontrolled  taxpayers engaged in comparable transactions under comparable  circumstances. For this purpose, the comparability of transactions and  circumstances must be evaluated considering all factors that could  affect prices or profits in arm's length dealings (comparability  factors). While a specific comparability factor may be of particular  importance in applying a method, each method requires analysis of all of  the factors that affect comparability under that method. Such factors  include the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Functions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contractual terms;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Risks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Economic conditions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Property or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standard of comparability. In order to be considered comparable  to a controlled transaction, an uncontrolled transaction need not be  identical to the controlled transaction, but must be sufficiently  similar that it provides a reliable measure of an arm's length result.  If there are material differences between the controlled and  uncontrolled transactions, adjustments must be made if the effect of  such differences on prices or profits can be ascertained with sufficient  accuracy to improve the reliability of the results. For purposes of this  section, a material difference is one that would materially affect the  measure of an arm's length result under the method being applied. If  adjustments for material differences cannot be made, the uncontrolled  transaction may be used as a measure of an arm's length result, but the  reliability of the analysis will be reduced. Generally, such adjustments  must be made to the results of the uncontrolled comparable and must be  based on commercial practices, economic principles, or statistical  analyses. The extent and reliability of any adjustments will affect the  relative reliability of the analysis. See Sec. 1.482-1(c)(1) (Best  method rule). In any event, unadjusted industry average returns  themselves cannot establish arm's length results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Factors for determining comparability. The comparability factors  listed in Sec. 1.482-1(d)(1) are discussed in this section. Each of  these factors must be considered in determining the degree of  comparability between transactions or taxpayers and the extent to which  comparability adjustments may be necessary. In addition, in certain  cases involving special circumstances, the rules under paragraph (d)(4)  of this section must be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Functional analysis. Determining the degree of comparability  between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison  of the functions performed, and associated resources employed, by the  taxpayers in each transaction. This comparison is based on a functional  analysis that identifies and compares the economically significant  activities undertaken, or to be undertaken, by the taxpayers in both  controlled and uncontrolled transactions. A functional analysis should  also include consideration of the resources that are employed, or to be  employed, in conjunction with the activities undertaken, including  consideration of the type of assets used, such as plant and equipment,  or the use of valuable intangibles. A functional analysis is not a  pricing method and does not itself determine the arm's length result for  the controlled transaction under review. Functions that may need to be  accounted for in determining the comparability of two transactions  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Research and development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Product design and engineering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Manufacturing, production and process engineering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Product fabrication, extraction, and assembly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Purchasing and materials management;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Marketing and distribution functions, including inventory  management, warranty administration, and advertising activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Transportation and warehousing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Managerial, legal, accounting and finance, credit and  collection, training, and personnel management services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contractual terms--(A) In general. Determining the degree of  comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions  requires a comparison of the significant contractual terms that could  affect the results of the two transactions. These terms include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The form of consideration charged or paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sales or purchase volume;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The scope and terms of warranties provided;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rights to updates, revisions or modifications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The duration of relevant license, contract or other agreements,  and termination or renegotiation rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Collateral transactions or ongoing business relationships  between the buyer and the seller, including arrangements for the  provision of ancillary or subsidiary services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Extension of credit and payment terms. Thus, for example, if the  time for payment of the amount charged in a controlled transaction  differs from the time for payment of the amount charged in an  uncontrolled transaction, an adjustment to reflect the difference in  payment terms should be made if such difference would have a material  effect on price. Such comparability adjustment is required even if no  interest would be allocated or imputed under Sec. 1.482-2(a) or other  applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identifying contractual terms--(1) Written agreement. The  contractual terms, including the consequent allocation of risks, that  are agreed to in writing before the transactions are entered into will  be respected if such terms are consistent with the economic substance of  the underlying transactions. In evaluating economic substance, greatest  weight will be given to the actual conduct of the parties, and the  respective legal rights of the parties (see, for example, Sec. 1.482- 4(f)(3) (Ownership of intangible property)). If the contractual terms  are inconsistent with the economic substance of the underlying  transaction, the district director may disregard such terms and impute  terms that are consistent with the economic substance of the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No written agreement. In the absence of a written agreement, the  district director may impute a contractual agreement between the  controlled taxpayers consistent with the economic substance of the  transaction. In determining the economic substance of the transaction,  greatest weight will be given to the actual conduct of the parties and  their respective legal rights (see, for example, Sec. 1.482-4(f)(3)  (Ownership of intangible property)). For example, if, without a written  agreement, a controlled taxpayer operates at full capacity and regularly  sells all of its output to another member of its controlled group, the  district director may impute a purchasing contract from the course of  conduct of the controlled taxpayers, and determine that the producer  bears little risk that the buyer will fail to purchase its full output.  Further, if an established industry convention or usage of trade assigns  a risk or resolves an issue, that convention or usage will be followed  if the conduct of the taxpayers is consistent with it. See UCC 1-205.  For example, unless otherwise agreed, payment generally is due at the  time and place at which the buyer is to receive goods. See UCC 2-310.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (d)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Differences in volume. USP, a United States agricultural  exporter, regularly buys transportation services from FSub, its foreign  subsidiary, to ship its products from the United States to overseas  markets. Although FSub occasionally provides transportation services to  URA, an unrelated domestic corporation, URA accounts for only 10% of the  gross revenues of FSub, and the remaining 90% of FSub's gross revenues  are attributable to FSub's transactions with   USP. In determining the degree of comparability between FSub's  uncontrolled transaction with URA and its controlled transaction with  USP, the difference in volumes involved in the two transactions and the  regularity with which these services are provided must be taken into  account if such difference would have a material effect on the price  charged. Inability to make reliable adjustments for these differences  would affect the reliability of the results derived from the  uncontrolled transaction as a measure of the arm's length result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  FS manufactures product XX and sells that product to its parent  corporation, P. FS also sells product XX to uncontrolled taxpayers at a  price of $100 per unit. Except for the volume of each transaction, the  sales to P and to uncontrolled taxpayers take place under substantially  the same economic conditions and contractual terms. In uncontrolled  transactions, FS offers a 2% discount for quantities of 20 per order,  and a 5% discount for quantities of 100 per order. If P purchases  product XX in quantities of 60 per order, in the absence of other  reliable information, it may reasonably be concluded that the arm's  length price to P would be $100, less a discount of 3.5%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If P purchases product XX in quantities of 1,000 per order, a  reliable estimate of the appropriate volume discount must be based on  proper economic or statistical analysis, not necessarily a linear  extrapolation from the 2% and 5% catalog discounts applicable to sales  of 20 and 100 units, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  FP, a foreign producer of wristwatches, is the registered holder of the  YY trademark in the United States and in other countries worldwide. In  year 1, FP enters the United States market by selling YY wristwatches to  its newly organized United States subsidiary, USSub, for distribution in  the United States market. USSub pays FP a fixed price per wristwatch.  USSub and FP undertake, without separate compensation, marketing  activities to establish the YY trademark in the United States market.  Unrelated foreign producers of trademarked wristwatches and their  authorized United States distributors respectively undertake similar  marketing activities in independent arrangements involving distribution  of trademarked wristwatches in the United States market. In years 1  through 6, USSub markets and sells YY wristwatches in the United States.  Further, in years 1 through 6, USSub undertakes incremental marketing  activities in addition to the activities similar to those observed in  the independent distribution transactions in the United States market.  FP does not directly or indirectly compensate USSub for performing these  incremental activities during years 1 through 6. Assume that, aside from  these incremental activities, and after any adjustments are made to  improve the reliability of the comparison, the price paid per wristwatch  by the independent, authorized distributors of wristwatches would  provide the most reliable measure of the arm's length price paid per YY  wristwatch by USSub.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By year 7, the wristwatches with the YY trademark generate a  premium return in the United States market, as compared to wristwatches  marketed by the independent distributors. In year 7, substantially all  the premium return from the YY trademark in the United States market is  attributed to FP, for example through an increase in the price paid per  watch by USSub, or by some other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an allocation of income is appropriate  in year 7, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the  arrangements between USSub and FP, and the parties' course of conduct  throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner  determines that it is unlikely that, ex ante, an uncontrolled taxpayer  operating at arm's length would engage in the incremental marketing  activities to develop or enhance intangible property owned by another  party unless it received contemporaneous compensation or otherwise had a  reasonable anticipation of receiving a future benefit from those  activities. In this case, USSub's undertaking the incremental marketing  activities in years 1 through 6 is a course of conduct that is  inconsistent with the parties' attribution to FP in year 7 of  substantially all the premium return from the enhanced YY trademark in  the United States market. Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or  more agreements between USSub and FP, consistent with the economic  substance of their course of conduct, which would afford USSub an  appropriate portion of the premium return from the YY trademark  wristwatches. For example, the Commissioner may impute a separate  services agreement that affords USSub contingent-payment compensation  for its incremental marketing activities in years 1 through 6, which  benefited FP by contributing to the value of the trademark owned by FP.  In the alternative, the Commissioner may impute a long-term, exclusive  agreement to exploit the YY trademark in the United States that allows  USSub to benefit from the incremental marketing activities it performed.  As another alternative, the Commissioner may require FP to compensate  USSub for terminating USSub's imputed long-term, exclusive agreement to  exploit the YY trademark in the United States, an agreement that USSub  made more valuable at its own expense and risk. The taxpayer may present  additional facts that could indicate which of these or other alternative   agreements best reflects the economic substance of the underlying  transactions, consistent with the parties' course of conduct in the  particular case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  FP, a foreign producer of athletic gear, is the registered holder of the  AA trademark in the United States and in other countries worldwide. In  year 1, FP enters into a licensing agreement that affords its newly  organized United States subsidiary, USSub, exclusive rights to certain  manufacturing and marketing intangible property (including the AA  trademark) for purposes of manufacturing and marketing athletic gear in  the United States under the AA trademark. The contractual terms of this  agreement obligate USSub to pay FP a royalty based on sales, and also  obligate both FP and USSub to undertake without separate compensation  specified types and levels of marketing activities. Unrelated foreign  businesses license independent United States businesses to manufacture  and market athletic gear in the United States, using trademarks owned by  the unrelated foreign businesses. The contractual terms of these  uncontrolled transactions require the licensees to pay royalties based  on sales of the merchandise, and obligate the licensors and licensees to  undertake without separate compensation specified types and levels of  marketing activities. In years 1 through 6, USSub manufactures and sells  athletic gear under the AA trademark in the United States. Assume that,  after adjustments are made to improve the reliability of the comparison  for any material differences relating to marketing activities,  manufacturing or marketing intangible property, and other comparability  factors, the royalties paid by independent licensees would provide the  most reliable measure of the arm's length royalty owed by USSub to FP,  apart from the additional facts in paragraph (ii) of this Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In years 1 through 6, USSub performs incremental marketing  activities with respect to the AA trademark athletic gear, in addition  to the activities required under the terms of the license agreement with  FP, that are also incremental as compared to those observed in the  comparables. FP does not directly or indirectly compensate USSub for  performing these incremental activities during years 1 through 6. By  year 7, AA trademark athletic gear generates a premium return in the  United States, as compared to similar athletic gear marketed by  independent licensees. In year 7, USSub and FP enter into a separate  services agreement under which FP agrees to compensate USSub on a cost  basis for the incremental marketing activities that USSub performed  during years 1 through 6, and to compensate USSub on a cost basis for  any incremental marketing activities it may perform in year 7 and  subsequent years. In addition, the parties revise the license agreement  executed in year 1, and increase the royalty to a level that attributes  to FP substantially all the premium return from sales of the AA  trademark athletic gear in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an allocation of income is appropriate  in year 7, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the  arrangements between USSub and FP and the parties' course of conduct  throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner  determines that it is unlikely that, ex ante, an uncontrolled taxpayer  operating at arm's length would engage in the incremental marketing  activities to develop or enhance intangible property owned by another  party unless it received contemporaneous compensation or otherwise had a  reasonable anticipation of a future benefit. In this case, USSub's  undertaking the incremental marketing activities in years 1 through 6 is  a course of conduct that is inconsistent with the parties' adoption in  year 7 of contractual terms by which FP compensates USSub on a cost  basis for the incremental marketing activities that it performed.  Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between  USSub and FP, consistent with the economic substance of their course of  conduct, which would afford USSub an appropriate portion of the premium  return from the AA trademark athletic gear. For example, the  Commissioner may impute a separate services agreement that affords USSub  contingent-payment compensation for the incremental activities it  performed during years 1 through 6, which benefited FP by contributing  to the value of the trademark owned by FP. In the alternative, the  Commissioner may impute a long-term, exclusive United States license  agreement that allows USSub to benefit from the incremental activities.  As another alternative, the Commissioner may require FP to compensate  USSub for terminating USSub's imputed long-term United States license  agreement, a license that USSub made more valuable at its own expense  and risk. The taxpayer may present additional facts that could indicate  which of these or other alternative agreements best reflects the  economic substance of the underlying transactions, consistent with the  parties' course of conduct in this particular case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of Example 4. As in Example 4, assume that, after  adjustments are made to improve the reliability of the comparison for  any material differences relating to marketing activities, manufacturing  or marketing intangible property, and other comparability factors, the  royalties paid by independent licensees would provide the most reliable  measure of the arm's length royalty owed by USSub to   FP, apart from the additional facts described in paragraph (ii) of this  Example 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In years 1 through 4, USSub performs certain incremental  marketing activities with respect to the AA trademark athletic gear, in  addition to the activities required under the terms of the basic license  agreement, that are also incremental as compared with those activities  observed in the comparables. At the start of year 1, FP enters into a  separate services agreement with USSub, which states that FP will  compensate USSub quarterly, in an amount equal to specified costs plus  X%, for these incremental marketing functions. Further, these written  agreements reflect the intent of the parties that USSub receive such  compensation from FP throughout the term of the agreement, without  regard to the success or failure of the promotional activities. During  years 1 through 4, USSub performs marketing activities pursuant to the  separate services agreement and in each year USSub receives the  specified compensation from FP on a cost of services plus basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In evaluating year 4, the Commissioner performs an analysis of  independent parties that perform promotional activities comparable to  those performed by USSub and that receive separately-stated compensation  on a current basis without contingency. The Commissioner determines that  the magnitude of the specified cost plus X% is outside the arm's length  range in each of years 1 through 4. Based on an evaluation of all the  facts and circumstances, the Commissioner makes an allocation to require  payment of compensation to USSub for the promotional activities  performed in year 4, based on the median of the interquartile range of  the arm's length markups charged by the uncontrolled comparables  described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Given that based on facts and circumstances, the terms agreed  by the controlled parties were that FP would bear all risks associated  with the promotional activities performed by USSub to promote the AA  trademark product in the United States market, and given that the  parties' conduct during the years examined was consistent with this  allocation of risk, the fact that the cost of services plus markup on  USSub's services was outside the arm's length range does not, without  more, support imputation of additional contractual terms based on  alternative views of the economic substance of the transaction, such as  terms indicating that USSub, rather than FP, bore the risk associated  with these activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Company X is a member of a controlled group that has been in operation  in the pharmaceutical sector for many years. In years 1 through 4,  Company X undertakes research and development activities. As a result of  those activities, Company X developed a compound that may be more  effective than existing medications in the treatment of certain  conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Company Y is acquired in year 4 by the controlled group that  includes Company X. Once Company Y is acquired, Company X makes  available to Company Y a large amount of technical data concerning the  new compound, which Company Y uses to register patent rights with  respect to the compound in several jurisdictions, making Company Y the  legal owner of such patents. Company Y then enters into licensing  agreements with group members that afford Company Y 100% of the premium  return attributable to use of the intangible property by its  subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an allocation is appropriate in year 4,  the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the arrangements  between Company X and Company Y, and the parties' course of conduct  throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner  determines that it is unlikely that an uncontrolled taxpayer operating  at arm's length would make available the results of its research and  development or perform services that resulted in transfer of valuable  know how to another party unless it received contemporaneous  compensation or otherwise had a reasonable anticipation of receiving a  future benefit from those activities. In this case, Company X's  undertaking the research and development activities and then providing  technical data and know-how to Company Y in year 4 is inconsistent with  the registration and subsequent exploitation of the patent by Company Y.  Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between  Company X and Company Y consistent with the economic substance of their  course of conduct, which would afford Company X an appropriate portion  of the premium return from the patent rights. For example, the  Commissioner may impute a separate services agreement that affords  Company X contingent-payment compensation for its services in year 4 for  the benefit of Company Y, consisting of making available to Company Y  technical data, know-how, and other fruits of research and development  conducted in previous years. These services benefited Company Y by  giving rise to and contributing to the value of the patent rights that  were ultimately registered by Company Y. In the alternative, the  Commissioner may impute a transfer of patentable intangible property  rights from Company X to Company Y immediately preceding the  registration of patent rights by Company Y. The taxpayer may present  additional facts that could indicate which of these or other alternative  agreements best reflects the economic substance of the underlying  transactions, consistent with the parties' course of conduct in the  particular case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Risk--(A) Comparability. Determining the degree of  comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires  a comparison of the significant risks that could affect the prices that  would be charged or paid, or the profit that would be earned, in the two  transactions. Relevant risks to consider include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Market risks, including fluctuations in cost, demand, pricing,  and inventory levels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risks associated with the success or failure of research and  development activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency  rates of exchange and interest rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Credit and collection risks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Product liability risks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> General business risks related to the ownership of property,  plant, and equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>  (Identifying contractual terms). Thus, the allocation of risks specified  or implied by the taxpayer's contractual terms will generally be  respected if it is consistent with the economic substance of the  transaction. An allocation of risk between controlled taxpayers after  the outcome of such risk is known or reasonably knowable lacks economic  substance. In considering the economic substance of the transaction, the  following facts are relevant--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the pattern of the controlled taxpayer's conduct over  time is consistent with the purported allocation of risk between the  controlled taxpayers; or where the pattern is changed, whether the  relevant contractual arrangements have been modified accordingly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether a controlled taxpayer has the financial capacity to fund  losses that might be expected to occur as the result of the assumption  of a risk, or whether, at arm's length, another party to the controlled  transaction would ultimately suffer the consequences of such losses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which each controlled taxpayer exercises  managerial or operational control over the business activities that  directly influence the amount of income or loss realized. In arm's  length dealings, parties ordinarily bear a greater share of those risks  over which they have relatively more control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (d)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FD, the wholly-owned foreign distributor of USM, a U.S.  manufacturer, buys widgets from USM under a written contract. Widgets  are a generic electronic appliance. Under the terms of the contract, FD  must buy and take title to 20,000 widgets for each of the five years of  the contract at a price of $10 per widget. The widgets will be sold  under FD's label, and FD must finance any marketing strategies to  promote sales in the foreign market. There are no rebate or buy back  provisions. FD has adequate financial capacity to fund its obligations  under the contract under any circumstances that could reasonably be  expected to arise. In Years 1, 2 and 3, FD sold only 10,000 widgets at a  price of $11 per unit. In Year 4, FD sold its entire inventory of  widgets at a price of $25 per unit. Since the contractual terms  allocating market risk were agreed to before the outcome of such risk  was known or reasonably knowable, FD had the financial capacity to bear  the market risk that it would be unable to sell all of the widgets it  purchased currently, and its conduct was consistent over time, FD will  be deemed to bear the risk.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in  Year 1 FD had only $100,000 in total capital, including loans. In  subsequent years USM makes no additional contributions to the capital of  FD, and FD is unable to obtain any capital through loans from an  unrelated party. Nonetheless, USM continues to sell 20,000 widgets  annually to FD under the terms of the contract, and USM extends credit  to FD to enable it to finance the purchase. FD does not have the  financial capacity in Years 1, 2 and 3 to finance the purchase of the  widgets given that it could not sell most of the widgets it purchased  during those years. Thus, notwithstanding the terms of the contract, USM  and not FD assumed the market risk that a substantial portion of the  widgets could not be sold, since in that event FD would not be able to  pay USM for all of the widgets it purchased.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. S, a Country X corporation, manufactures small motors  that it sells to P, its U.S. parent. P incorporates the motors into  various products and sells those products to uncontrolled customers in  the United States. The contract price for the motors is   expressed in U.S. dollars, effectively allocating the currency risk for  these transactions to S for any currency fluctuations between the time  the contract is signed and payment is made. As long as S has adequate  financial capacity to bear this currency risk (including by hedging all  or part of the risk) and the conduct of S and P is consistent with the  terms of the contract (i.e., the contract price is not adjusted to  reflect exchange rate movements), the agreement of the parties to  allocate the exchange risk to S will be respected.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. USSub is the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of FP, a  foreign manufacturer. USSub acts as a distributor of goods manufactured  by FP. FP and USSub execute an agreement providing that FP will bear any  ordinary product liability costs arising from defects in the goods  manufactured by FP. In practice, however, when ordinary product  liability claims are sustained against USSub and FP, USSub pays the  resulting damages. Therefore, the district director disregards the  contractual arrangement regarding product liability costs between FP and  USSub, and treats the risk as having been assumed by USSub.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Economic conditions. Determining the degree of comparability  between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison  of the significant economic conditions that could affect the prices that  would be charged or paid, or the profit that would be earned in each of  the transactions. These factors include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The similarity of geographic markets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The relative size of each market, and the extent of the overall  economic development in each market;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The level of the market (e.g., wholesale, retail, etc.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The relevant market shares for the products, properties, or  services transferred or provided;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The location-specific costs of the factors of production and  distribution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The extent of competition in each market with regard to the  property or services under review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The economic condition of the particular industry, including  whether the market is in contraction or expansion; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The alternatives realistically available to the buyer and  seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Property or services. Evaluating the degree of comparability  between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison  of the property or services transferred in the transactions. This  comparison may include any intangible property that is embedded in  tangible property or services being transferred (embedded intangibles).  The comparability of the embedded intangibles will be analyzed using the  factors listed in Sec. 1.482-4(c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) (comparable intangible  property). The relevance of product comparability in evaluating the  relative reliability of the results will depend on the method applied.  For guidance concerning the specific comparability considerations  applicable to transfers of tangible and intangible property and  performance of services, see Secs. 1.482-3 through 1.482-6 and  Sec. 1.482-9; see also Secs. 1.482-3(f), 1.482-4(f)(4), and 1.482-9(m),  dealing with the coordination of intangible and tangible property and  performance of services rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special circumstances--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Market share strategy. In certain  circumstances, taxpayers may adopt strategies to enter new markets or to  increase a product's share of an existing market (market share  strategy). Such a strategy would be reflected by temporarily increased  market development expenses or resale prices that are temporarily lower  than the prices charged for comparable products in the same market.  Whether or not the strategy is reflected in the transfer price depends  on which party to the controlled transaction bears the costs of the  pricing strategy. In any case, the effect of a market share strategy on  a controlled transaction will be taken into account only if it can be  shown that an uncontrolled taxpayer engaged in a comparable strategy  under comparable circumstances for a comparable period of time, and the  taxpayer provides documentation that substantiates the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The costs incurred to implement the market share strategy are  borne by the controlled taxpayer that would obtain the future profits  that result from the strategy, and there is a reasonable likelihood that  the strategy will result in future profits that reflect an appropriate  return in relation to the costs incurred to implement it;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The market share strategy is pursued only for a period of time  that is reasonable, taking into consideration   the industry and product in question; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The market share strategy, the related costs and expected  returns, and any agreement between the controlled taxpayers to share the  related costs, were established before the strategy was implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Different geographic markets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Uncontrolled  comparables ordinarily should be derived from the geographic market in  which the controlled taxpayer operates, because there may be significant  differences in economic conditions in different markets. If information  from the same market is not available, an uncontrolled comparable  derived from a different geographic market may be considered if  adjustments are made to account for differences between the two markets.  If information permitting adjustments for such differences is not  available, then information derived from uncontrolled comparables in the  most similar market for which reliable data is available may be used,  but the extent of such differences may affect the reliability of the  method for purposes of the best method rule. For this purpose, a  geographic market is any geographic area in which the economic  conditions for the relevant product or service are substantially the  same, and may include multiple countries, depending on the economic  conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (d)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. Manuco, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of P, a U.S.  corporation, manufactures products in Country Z for sale to P. No  uncontrolled transactions are located that would provide a reliable  measure of the arm's length result under the comparable uncontrolled  price method. The district director considers applying the cost plus  method or the comparable profits method. Information on uncontrolled  taxpayers performing comparable functions under comparable circumstances  in the same geographic market is not available. Therefore, adjusted data  from uncontrolled manufacturers in other markets may be considered in  order to apply the cost plus method. In this case, comparable  uncontrolled manufacturers are found in the United States. Accordingly,  data from the comparable U.S. uncontrolled manufacturers, as adjusted to  account for differences between the United States and Country Z's  geographic market, is used to test the arm's length price paid by P to  Manuco. However, the use of such data may affect the reliability of the  results for purposes of the best method rule. See Sec. 1.482-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Location savings. If an uncontrolled taxpayer operates in a  different geographic market than the controlled taxpayer, adjustments  may be necessary to account for significant differences in costs  attributable to the geographic markets. These adjustments must be based  on the effect such differences would have on the consideration charged  or paid in the controlled transaction given the relative competitive  positions of buyers and sellers in each market. Thus, for example, the  fact that the total costs of operating in a controlled manufacturer's  geographic market are less than the total costs of operating in other  markets ordinarily justifies higher profits to the manufacturer only if  the cost differences would increase the profits of comparable  uncontrolled manufacturers operating at arm's length, given the  competitive positions of buyers and sellers in that market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Example. Couture, a U.S. apparel design corporation, contracts with  Sewco, its wholly owned Country Y subsidiary, to manufacture its  clothes. Costs of operating in Country Y are significantly lower than  the operating costs in the United States. Although clothes with the  Couture label sell for a premium price, the actual production of the  clothes does not require significant specialized knowledge that could  not be acquired by actual or potential competitors to Sewco at  reasonable cost. Thus, Sewco's functions could be performed by several  actual or potential competitors to Sewco in geographic markets that are  similar to Country Y. Thus, the fact that production is less costly in  Country Y will not, in and of itself, justify additional profits derived  from lower operating costs in Country Y inuring to Sewco, because the  competitive positions of the other actual or potential producers in  similar geographic markets capable of performing the same functions at  the same low costs indicate that at arm's length such profits would not  be retained by Sewco.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transactions ordinarily not accepted as comparables--(A) In  general. Transactions ordinarily will not constitute reliable measures  of an arm's   length result for purposes of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> They are not made in the ordinary course of business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One of the principal purposes of the uncontrolled transaction  was to establish an arm's length result with respect to the controlled  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principle of  this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Not in the ordinary course of business. USP, a United  States manufacturer of computer software, sells its products to FSub,  its foreign distributor in country X. Compco, a United States competitor  of USP, also sells its products in X through unrelated distributors.  However, in the year under review, Compco is forced into bankruptcy, and  Compco liquidates its inventory by selling all of its products to  unrelated distributors in X for a liquidation price. Because the sale of  its entire inventory was not a sale in the ordinary course of business,  Compco's sale cannot be used as an uncontrolled comparable to determine  USP's arm's length result from its controlled transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Principal purpose of establishing an arm's length result.  USP, a United States manufacturer of farm machinery, sells its products  to FSub, its wholly-owned distributor in Country Y. USP, operating at  nearly full capacity, sells 95% of its inventory to FSub. To make use of  its excess capacity, and also to establish a comparable uncontrolled  price for its transfer price to FSub, USP increases its production to  full capacity. USP sells its excess inventory to Compco, an unrelated  foreign distributor in Country X. Country X has approximately the same  economic conditions as that of Country Y. Because one of the principal  purposes of selling to Compco was to establish an arm's length price for  its controlled transactions with FSub, USP's sale to Compco cannot be  used as an uncontrolled comparable to determine USP's arm's length  result from its controlled transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Arm's length range--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In some cases, application  of a pricing method will produce a single result that is the most  reliable measure of an arm's length result. In other cases, application  of a method may produce a number of results from which a range of  reliable results may be derived. A taxpayer will not be subject to  adjustment if its results fall within such range (arm's length range).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of arm's length range--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Single method. The  arm's length range is ordinarily determined by applying a single pricing  method selected under the best method rule to two or more uncontrolled  transactions of similar comparability and reliability. Use of more than  one method may be appropriate for the purposes described in paragraph  (c)(2)(iii) of this section (Best method rule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selection of comparables. Uncontrolled comparables must be  selected based upon the comparability criteria relevant to the method  applied and must be sufficiently similar to the controlled transaction  that they provide a reliable measure of an arm's length result. If  material differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled  transactions, adjustments must be made to the results of the  uncontrolled transaction if the effect of such differences on price or  profits can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to improve the  reliability of the results. See Sec. 1.482-1(d)(2) (Standard of  comparability). The arm's length range will be derived only from those  uncontrolled comparables that have, or through adjustments can be  brought to, a similar level of comparability and reliability, and  uncontrolled comparables that have a significantly lower level of  comparability and reliability will not be used in establishing the arm's  length range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comparables included in arm's length range--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  The arm's length range will consist of the results of all of the  uncontrolled comparables that meet the following conditions: the  information on the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled  comparables is sufficiently complete that it is likely that all material  differences have been identified, each such difference has a definite  and reasonably ascertainable effect on price or profit, and an  adjustment is made to eliminate the effect of each such difference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjustment of range to increase reliability. If there are no  uncontrolled comparables described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this  section, the arm's length range is derived from the results of all the  uncontrolled comparables, selected pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of  this section, that achieve a similar level of comparability and  reliability. In such cases the reliability of the   analysis must be increased, where it is possible to do so, by adjusting  the range through application of a valid statistical method to the  results of all of the uncontrolled comparables so selected. The  reliability of the analysis is increased when statistical methods are  used to establish a range of results in which the limits of the range  will be determined such that there is a 75 percent probability of a  result falling above the lower end of the range and a 75 percent  probability of a result falling below the upper end of the range. The  interquartile range ordinarily provides an acceptable measure of this  range; however a different statistical method may be applied if it  provides a more reliable measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interquartile range. For purposes of this section, the  interquartile range is the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of  the results derived from the uncontrolled comparables. For this purpose,  the 25th percentile is the lowest result derived from an uncontrolled  comparable such that at least 25 percent of the results are at or below  the value of that result. However, if exactly 25 percent of the results  are at or below a result, then the 25th percentile is equal to the  average of that result and the next higher result derived from the  uncontrolled comparables. The 75th percentile is determined analogously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustment if taxpayer's results are outside arm's length range.  If the results of a controlled transaction fall outside the arm's length  range, the district director may make allocations that adjust the  controlled taxpayer's result to any point within the arm's length range.  If the interquartile range is used to determine the arm's length range,  such adjustment will ordinarily be to the median of all the results. The  median is the 50th percentile of the results, which is determined in a  manner analogous to that described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this  section (Interquartile range). In other cases, an adjustment normally  will be made to the arithmetic mean of all the results. See Sec. 1.482- 1(f)(2)(iii)(D) for determination of an adjustment when a controlled  taxpayer's result for a multiple year period falls outside an arm's  length range consisting of the average results of uncontrolled  comparables over the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Arm's length range not prerequisite to allocation. The rules of  this paragraph (e) do not require that the district director establish  an arm's length range prior to making an allocation under section 482.  Thus, for example, the district director may properly propose an  allocation on the basis of a single comparable uncontrolled price if the  comparable uncontrolled price method, as described in Sec. 1.482-3(b),  has been properly applied. However, if the taxpayer subsequently  demonstrates that the results claimed on its income tax return are  within the range established by additional equally reliable comparable  uncontrolled prices in a manner consistent with the requirements set  forth in Sec. 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii), then no allocation will be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To evaluate the arm's  length result of a controlled transaction between USSub, the United  States taxpayer under review, and FP, its foreign parent, the district  director considers applying the resale price method. The district  director identifies ten potential uncontrolled transactions. The  distributors in all ten uncontrolled transactions purchase and resell  similar products and perform similar functions to those of USSub.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> only these  four uncontrolled comparables may be used to establish an arm's length  range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  facts are the same as in Example 1. Applying the resale price method to  the four uncontrolled comparables, and making adjustments to the  uncontrolled comparables pursuant to Sec. 1.482-1(d)(2), the district  director derives the following results:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Result</p><p class="depth0">Comparable                            (price) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1............................................................     $44.00 2............................................................      45.00 3............................................................      45.00</p><p class="depth0">4............................................................      45.50 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The district director determines that data regarding the four  uncontrolled transactions is sufficiently complete and accurate so that  it is likely that all material differences between the controlled and  uncontrolled transactions have been identified, such differences have a  definite and reasonably ascertainable effect, and appropriate  adjustments were made for such differences. Accordingly, if the resale  price method is determined to be the best method pursuant to Sec. 1.482- 1(c), the arm's length range for the controlled transaction will consist  of the results of all of the uncontrolled comparables, pursuant to  paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Thus, the arm's length range  in this case would be the range from $44 to $45.50.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  The facts are the same as in Example 2, except in this case there are  some product and functional differences between the four uncontrolled  comparables and USSub. However, the data is insufficiently complete to  determine the effect of the differences. Applying the resale price  method to the four uncontrolled comparables, and making adjustments to  the uncontrolled comparables pursuant to Sec. 1.482-1(d)(2), the  district director derives the following results:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Result</p><p class="depth0">Uncontrolled comparable                      (price) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1............................................................     $42.00 2............................................................      44.00 3............................................................      45.00 4............................................................      47.50 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It cannot be established in this case that all material  differences are likely to have been identified and reliable adjustments  made for those differences. Accordingly, if the resale price method is  determined to be the best method pursuant to Sec. 1.482-1(c), the arm's  length range for the controlled transaction must be established pursuant  to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. In this case, the district  director uses the interquartile range to determine the arm's length  range, which is the range from $43 to $46.25. If USSub's price falls  outside this range, the district director may make an allocation. In  this case that allocation would be to the median of the results, or  $44.50.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To  evaluate the arm's length result of controlled transactions between USP,  a United States manufacturing company, and FSub, its foreign subsidiary,  the district director considers applying the comparable profits method.  The district director identifies 50 uncontrolled taxpayers within the  same industry that potentially could be used to apply the method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> only the other fifteen  uncontrolled comparables may be used to establish an arm's length range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Scope of review--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The authority to determine true  taxable income extends to any case in which either by inadvertence or  design the taxable income, in whole or in part, of a controlled taxpayer  is other than it would have been had the taxpayer, in the conduct of its  affairs, been dealing at arm's length with an uncontrolled taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Intent to evade or avoid tax not a prerequisite. In making  allocations under section 482, the district director is not restricted  to the case of improper accounting, to the case of a fraudulent,  colorable, or sham transaction, or to the case of a device designed to  reduce or avoid tax by shifting or distorting income, deductions,  credits, or allowances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Realization of income not a prerequisite--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The  district director may make an allocation under section 482 even if the  income ultimately anticipated from a series of transactions has not been  or is never realized. For example, if a controlled taxpayer sells a  product at less than an   arm's length price to a related taxpayer in one taxable year and the  second controlled taxpayer resells the product to an unrelated party in  the next taxable year, the district director may make an appropriate  allocation to reflect an arm's length price for the sale of the product  in the first taxable year, even though the second controlled taxpayer  had not realized any gross income from the resale of the product in the  first year. Similarly, if a controlled taxpayer lends money to a related  taxpayer in a taxable year, the district director may make an  appropriate allocation to reflect an arm's length charge for interest  during such taxable year even if the second controlled taxpayer does not  realize income during such year. Finally, even if two controlled  taxpayers realize an overall loss that is attributable to a particular  controlled transaction, an allocation under section 482 is not  precluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. USSub is a U.S. subsidiary of FP, a foreign corporation.  Parent manufactures product X and sells it to USSub. USSub functions as  a distributor of product X to unrelated customers in the United States.  The fact that FP may incur a loss on the manufacture and sale of product  X does not by itself establish that USSub, dealing with FP at arm's  length, also would incur a loss. An independent distributor acting at  arm's length with its supplier would in many circumstances be expected  to earn a profit without regard to the level of profit earned by the  supplier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonrecognition provisions may not bar allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. If necessary to prevent the avoidance of taxes or to clearly  reflect income, the district director may make an allocation under  section 482 with respect to transactions that otherwise qualify for  nonrecognition of gain or loss under applicable provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code (such as section 351 or 1031).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (f)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1 USP, a United States corporation, bought 100  shares of UR, an unrelated corporation, for $100,000. In Year 2, when  the value of the UR stock had decreased to $40,000, USP contributed all  100 shares of UR stock to its wholly-owned subsidiary in exchange for  subsidiary's capital stock. In Year 3, the subsidiary sold all of the UR  stock for $40,000 to an unrelated buyer, and on its U.S. income tax  return, claimed a loss of $60,000 attributable to the sale of the UR  stock. USP and its subsidiary do not file a consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the true taxable income of the subsidiary, the  district director may disallow the loss of $60,000 on the ground that  the loss was incurred by USP.

Section 482 and the regulations  thereunder apply to all controlled taxpayers, whether the controlled  taxpayer files a separate or consolidated U.S. income tax return. If a  controlled taxpayer files a separate return, its true separate taxable  income will be determined. If a controlled taxpayer is a party to a  consolidated return, the true consolidated taxable income of the  affiliated group and the true separate taxable income of the controlled  taxpayer must be determined consistently with the principles of a  consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules relating to determination of true taxable income. The  following rules must be taken into account in determining the true  taxable income of a controlled taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Aggregation of transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The combined effect  of two or more separate transactions (whether before, during, or after  the taxable year under review) may be considered, if such transactions,  taken as a whole, are so interrelated that consideration of multiple  transactions is the most reliable means of determining the arm's length  consideration for the controlled transactions. Generally, transactions  will be aggregated only when they involve related products or services,  as defined in Sec. 1.6038A-3(c)(7)(vii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (f)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P enters into a license agreement with S1, its  subsidiary, that permits S1 to use a proprietary manufacturing process  and to sell the output from this process throughout a specified region.  S1 uses the manufacturing process and sells its output to S2, another  subsidiary of P, which in turn resells the output to uncontrolled  parties in the specified region. In evaluating the arm's length  character of the royalty paid by S1 to P, it may be appropriate to  consider the arm's length character of the transfer prices   charged by S1 to S2 and the aggregate profits earned by S1 and S2 from  the use of the manufacturing process and the sale to uncontrolled  parties of the products produced by S1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. S1, S2, and S3 are Country Z subsidiaries of U.S.  manufacturer P. S1 is the exclusive Country Z distributor of computers  manufactured by P. S2 provides marketing services in connection with  sales of P computers in Country Z, and in this regard uses significant  marketing intangibles provided by P. S3 administers the warranty program  with respect to P computers in Country Z, including maintenance and  repair services. In evaluating the arm's length character of the  transfer price paid by S1 to P, of the fees paid by S2 to P for the use  of P marketing intangibles, and of the service fees earned by S2 and S3,  it may be appropriate to consider the combined effects of these separate  transactions because they are so interrelated that they are most  reliably analyzed on an aggregated basis.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2. In addition, U1,  U2, and U3 are uncontrolled taxpayers that carry out functions  comparable to those of S1, S2, and S3, respectively, with respect to  computers produced by unrelated manufacturers. R1, R2, and R3 are a  controlled group of taxpayers (unrelated to the P controlled group) that  also carry out functions comparable to those of S1, S2, and S3 with  respect to computers produced by their common parent. Prices charged to  uncontrolled customers of the R group differ from the prices charged to  customers of U1, U2, and U3. In determining whether the transactions of  U1, U2, and U3, or the transactions of R1, R2, and R3 would provide a  more reliable measure of the arm's length result, it is determined that  the interrelated R group transactions are more reliable than the wholly  independent transactions of U1, U2, and U3, given the interrelationship  of the P group transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. P enters into a license agreement with S1 that permits S1  to use a propriety process for manufacturing product X and to sell  product X to uncontrolled parties throughout a specified region. P also  sells to S1 product Y which is manufactured by P in the United States,  and which is unrelated to product X. Product Y is resold by S1 to  uncontrolled parties in the specified region. In evaluating the arm's  length character of the royalty paid by S1 to P for the use of the  manufacturing process for product X, and the transfer prices charged for  unrelated product Y, it would not be appropriate to consider the  combined effects of these separate and unrelated transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation based on taxpayer's actual transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. The Commissioner will evaluate the results of a transaction as  actually structured by the taxpayer unless its structure lacks economic  substance. However, the Commissioner may consider the alternatives  available to the taxpayer in determining whether the terms of the  controlled transaction would be acceptable to an uncontrolled taxpayer  faced with the same alternatives and operating under comparable  circumstances. In such cases the Commissioner may adjust the  consideration charged in the controlled transaction based on the cost or  profit of an alternative as adjusted to account for material differences  between the alternative and the controlled transaction, but will not  restructure the transaction as if the alternative had been adopted by  the taxpayer. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section (factors for  determining comparability; contractual terms and risk); Secs. 1.482- 3(e), 1.482-4(d), and 1.482-9(h) (unspecified methods).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (f)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. P and S are controlled taxpayers. P enters into a license  agreement with S that permits S to use a proprietary process for  manufacturing product X. Using its sales and marketing employees, S  sells product X to related and unrelated customers outside the United  States. If the license agreement between P and S has economic substance,  the district director ordinarily will not restructure the taxpayer's  transaction to treat P as if it had elected to exploit directly the  manufacturing process. However, the fact that P could have manufactured  product X may be taken into account under Sec. 1.482-4(d) in determining  the arm's length consideration for the controlled transaction. For an  example of such an analysis, see Example in Sec. 1.482-4(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Multiple year data--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The results of a  controlled transaction ordinarily will be compared with the results of  uncontrolled comparables occurring in the taxable year under review. It  may be appropriate, however, to consider data relating to the  uncontrolled comparables or the controlled taxpayer for one or more  years before or after the year under review. If data relating to  uncontrolled comparables from multiple years is used, data relating to  the controlled taxpayer for the same years ordinarily must be  considered. However, if such data is not available, reliable data from  other years, as   adjusted under paragraph (d)(2) (Standard of comparability) of this  section may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Circumstances warranting consideration of multiple year data.  The extent to which it is appropriate to consider multiple year data  depends on the method being applied and the issue being addressed.  Circumstances that may warrant consideration of data from multiple years  include the extent to which complete and accurate data are available for  the taxable year under review, the effect of business cycles in the  controlled taxpayer's industry, or the effects of life cycles of the  product or intangible property being examined. Data from one or more  years before or after the taxable year under review must ordinarily be  considered for purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph  (d)(3)(iii) of this section (risk), paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section  (market share strategy), Sec. 1.482-4(f)(2) (periodic adjustments),  Sec. 1.482-5 (comparable profits method), Sec. 1.482-9(f) (comparable  profits method for services), and Sec. 1.482-9(i) (contingent-payment  contractual terms for services). On the other hand, multiple year data  ordinarily will not be considered for purposes of applying the  comparable uncontrolled price method of Sec. 1.482-3(b) or the  comparable uncontrolled services price method of Sec. 1.482-9(c) (except  to the extent that risk or market share strategy issues are present).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> is illustrated by Example 3 of  paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Applications of methods using multiple year averages. If a  comparison of a controlled taxpayer's average result over a multiple  year period with the average results of uncontrolled comparables over  the same period would reduce the effect of short-term variations that  may be unrelated to transfer pricing, it may be appropriate to establish  a range derived from the average results of uncontrolled comparables  over a multiple year period to determine if an adjustment should be  made. In such a case the district director may make an adjustment if the  controlled taxpayer's average result for the multiple year period is not  within such range. Such a range must be determined in accordance with  Sec. 1.482-1(e) (Arm's length range). An adjustment in such a case  ordinarily will be equal to the difference, if any, between the  controlled taxpayer's result for the taxable year and the mid-point of  the uncontrolled comparables' results for that year. If the  interquartile range is used to determine the range of average results  for the multiple year period, such adjustment will ordinarily be made to  the median of all the results of the uncontrolled comparables for the  taxable year. See Example 2 of Sec. 1.482-5(e). In other cases, the  adjustment normally will be made to the arithmetic mean of all the  results of the uncontrolled comparables for the taxable year. However,  an adjustment will be made only to the extent that it would move the  controlled taxpayer's multiple year average closer to the arm's length  range for the multiple year period or to any point within such range. In  determining a controlled taxpayer's average result for a multiple year  period, adjustments made under this section for prior years will be  taken into account only if such adjustments have been finally  determined, as described in Sec. 1.482-1(g)(2)(iii). See Example 3 of  Sec. 1.482-5(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Examples. The following examples, in which S and P are  controlled taxpayers, illustrate this paragraph   (f)(2)(iii). Examples 1 and 4 also illustrate the principle of the arm's  length range of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P sold product Z to S for $60 per unit in 1995. Applying  the resale price method to data from uncontrolled comparables for the  same year establishes an arm's length range of prices for the controlled  transaction from $52 to $59 per unit. Since the price charged in the  controlled transaction falls outside the range, the district director  would ordinarily make an allocation under section 482. However, in this  case there are cyclical factors that affect the results of the  uncontrolled comparables (and that of the controlled transaction) that  cannot be adequately accounted for by specific adjustments to the data  for 1995. Therefore, the district director considers results over  multiple years to account for these factors. Under these circumstances,  it is appropriate to average the results of the uncontrolled comparables  over the years 1993, 1994, and 1995 to determine an arm's length range.  The averaged results establish an arm's length range of $56 to $58 per  unit. For consistency, the results of the controlled taxpayers must also  be averaged over the same years. The average price in the controlled  transaction over the three years is $57. Because the controlled transfer  price of product Z falls within the arm's length range, the district  director makes no allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP, a Country X corporation, designs and manufactures  machinery in Country X. FP's costs are incurred in Country X currency.  USSub is the exclusive distributor of FP's machinery in the United  States. The price of the machinery sold by FP to USSub is expressed in  Country X currency. Thus, USSub bears all of the currency risk  associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate between the time the  contract is signed and the payment is made. The prices charged by FP to  USSub for 1995 are under examination. In that year, the value of the  dollar depreciated against the currency of Country X, and as a result,  USSub's gross margin was only 8%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> UD is an uncontrolled distributor of similar machinery that  performs distribution functions substantially the same as those  performed by USSub, except that UD purchases and resells machinery in  transactions where both the purchase and resale prices are denominated  in U.S. dollars. Thus, UD had no currency exchange risk. UD's gross  margin in 1995 was 10%. UD's average gross margin for the period 1990 to  1998 has been 12%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> (Risk).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. FP manufactures product X in Country M and sells it to  USSub, which distributes X in the United States. USSub realizes losses  with respect to the controlled transactions in each of five consecutive  taxable years. In each of the five consecutive years a different  uncontrolled comparable realized a loss with respect to comparable  transactions equal to or greater than USSub's loss. Pursuant to  paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the district director examines  whether the uncontrolled comparables realized similar losses over a  comparable period of time, and finds that each of the five comparables  realized losses in only one of the five years, and their average result  over the five-year period was a profit. Based on this data, the district  director may conclude that the controlled taxpayer's results are not  within the arm's length range over the five year period, since the  economic conditions that resulted in the controlled taxpayer's loss did  not have a comparable effect over a comparable period of time on the  uncontrolled comparables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USP, a U.S. corporation, manufactures product Y in  the United States and sells it to FSub, which acts as USP's exclusive  distributor of product Y in Country N. The resale price method described  in Sec. 1.482-3(c) is used to evaluate whether the transfer price  charged by USP to FSub for the 1994 taxable year for product Y was arm's  length. For the period 1992 through 1994, FSub had a gross profit margin  for each year of 13%. A, B, C and D are uncontrolled distributors of  products that compete directly with product Y in country N. After making  appropriate adjustments in accordance with Secs. 1.482-1(d)(2) and  1.482-3(c), the gross profit margins for A, B, C, and D are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1992     1993     1994   Average ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A...................................       13        3        8     8.00 B...................................       11       13        2     8.67 7C..................................        4        7       13     8.00 7D..................................        7        9        6     7.33 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applying the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1(e), the district  director determines that the arm's length range of the average gross  profit margins is between 7.33 and 8.67. The district director concludes  that FSub's average gross margin of 13% is not within the arm's length  range, despite the fact that C's gross profit margin for 1994 was also  13%, since the economic conditions that caused S's result did not have a  comparable effect over a comparable period of time on the results of C  or the other uncontrolled comparables. In this   case, the district director makes an allocation equivalent to adjusting  FSub's gross profit margin for 1994 from 13% to the mean of the  uncontrolled comparables' results for 1994 (7.25%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Product lines and statistical techniques. The methods described  in Secs. 1.482-2 through 1.482-6 are generally stated in terms of  individual transactions. However, because a taxpayer may have controlled  transactions involving many different products, or many separate  transactions involving the same product, it may be impractical to  analyze every individual transaction to determine its arm's length  price. In such cases, it is permissible to evaluate the arm's length  results by applying the appropriate methods to the overall results for  product lines or other groupings. In addition, the arm's length results  of all related party transactions entered into by a controlled taxpayer  may be evaluated by employing sampling and other valid statistical  techniques.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Allocations apply to results, not methods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. In  evaluating whether the result of a controlled transaction is arm's  length, it is not necessary for the district director to determine  whether the method or procedure that a controlled taxpayer employs to  set the terms for its controlled transactions corresponds to the method  or procedure that might have been used by a taxpayer dealing at arm's  length with an uncontrolled taxpayer. Rather, the district director will  evaluate the result achieved rather than the method the taxpayer used to  determine its prices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (f)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FS is a foreign subsidiary of P, a U.S. corporation. P  manufactures and sells household appliances. FS operates as P's  exclusive distributor in Europe. P annually establishes the price for  each of its appliances sold to FS as part of its annual budgeting,  production allocation and scheduling, and performance evaluation  processes. FS's aggregate gross margin earned in its distribution  business is 18%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ED is an uncontrolled European distributor of competing  household appliances. After adjusting for minor differences in the level  of inventory, volume of sales, and warranty programs conducted by FS and  ED, ED's aggregate gross margin is also 18%. Thus, the district director  may conclude that the aggregate prices charged by P for its appliances  sold to FS are arm's length, without determining whether the budgeting,  production, and performance evaluation processes of P are similar to  such processes used by ED.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Collateral adjustments with respect to allocations under section  482--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The district director will take into account  appropriate collateral adjustments with respect to allocations under  section 482. Appropriate collateral adjustments may include correlative  allocations, conforming adjustments, and setoffs, as described in this  paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Correlative allocations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. When the district  director makes an allocation under section 482 (referred to in this  paragraph (g)(2) as the primary allocation), appropriate correlative  allocations will also be made with respect to any other member of the  group affected by the allocation. Thus, if the district director makes  an allocation of income, the district director will not only increase  the income of one member of the group, but correspondingly decrease the  income of the other member. In addition, where appropriate, the district  director may make such further correlative allocations as may be  required by the initial correlative allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of carrying out correlative allocation. The district  director will furnish to the taxpayer with respect to which the primary  allocation is made a written statement of the amount and nature of the  correlative allocation. The correlative allocation must be reflected in  the documentation of the other member of the group that is maintained  for U.S. tax purposes, without regard to whether it affects the U.S.  income tax liability of the other member for any open year. In some  circumstances the allocation will have an immediate U.S. tax effect, by  changing the taxable income computation of the other member (or the  taxable income computation of a shareholder of the other member, for  example, under the provisions of subpart F of the Internal Revenue  Code). Alternatively, the correlative allocation may not be reflected on  any U.S. tax return until a later year, for example when a dividend is  paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Events triggering correlative allocation. For purposes of this  paragraph (g)(2), a primary allocation will not be considered to have  been made (and therefore, correlative allocations are not required to be  made) until the date of a final determination with respect to the  allocation under section 482. For this purpose, a final determination  includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assessment of tax following execution by the taxpayer of a Form  870 (Waiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency  in Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment) with respect to such  allocation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Acceptance of a Form 870-AD (Offer of Waiver of Restriction on  Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax and Acceptance of  Overassessment);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payment of the deficiency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Stipulation in the Tax Court of the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Final determination of tax liability by offer-in-compromise,  closing agreement, or final resolution (determined under the principles  of section 7481) of a judicial proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (g)(2). In each example, X and Y are members of the same group of  controlled taxpayers and each regularly computes its income on a  calendar year basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this section, is considered to have been made in 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The adjustment made to X's income under section 482 requires a  correlative allocation with respect to Y's income. The district director  notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the adjustment made  with respect to Y. Y had net operating losses in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996,  and 1997. Although a correlative adjustment will not have an effect on  Y's U.S. income tax liability for 1996, an adjustment increasing Y's net  operating loss for 1996 will be made for purposes of determining Y's  U.S. income tax liability for 1998 or a later taxable year to which the  increased net operating loss may be carried.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1995, X, a U.S. construction company, provided  engineering services to Y, a U.S. corporation, in the construction of  Y's factory. In 1997, the district director determines that the fees  paid by Y to X for its services were not arm's length and proposes to  make an adjustment to the income of X. X consents to an assessment  reflecting such adjustment by executing Form 870. An assessment of the  tax with respect to such adjustment is made in 1997. The district  director notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the  adjustment to be made with respect to Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fees paid by Y for X's engineering services properly  constitute a capital expenditure. Y does not place the factory into  service until 1998. Therefore, a correlative adjustment increasing Y's  basis in the factory does not affect Y's U.S. income tax liability for  1997. However, the correlative adjustment must be made in the books and  records maintained by Y for its U.S. income tax purposes and such  adjustment will be taken into account in computing Y's allowable  depreciation or gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the factory.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 1995, X, a U.S. corporation, makes a loan to Y, its  foreign subsidiary not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. In 1997, the  district director, upon determining that the interest charged on the  loan was not arm's length, proposes to adjust X's income to reflect an  arm's length interest rate. X consents to an assessment reflecting such  allocation by executing Form 870, and an assessment of the tax with  respect to the section 482 allocation is made in 1997. The district  director notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the  correlative allocation to be made with respect to Y. Although the  correlative adjustment does not have an effect on Y's U.S. income tax  liability, the adjustment must be reflected in the documentation of Y  that is maintained for U.S. tax purposes. Thus, the adjustment must be  reflected in the determination of the amount of Y's earnings and profits  for 1995 and subsequent years, and the adjustment must be made to the  extent it has an effect on any person's U.S. income tax liability for  any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments to conform accounts to reflect section 482  allocations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Appropriate adjustments must be made to  conform a taxpayer's accounts to reflect allocations made under section  482. Such adjustments may include the treatment of an allocated amount  as a dividend or a capital contribution (as appropriate), or, in  appropriate   cases, pursuant to such applicable revenue procedures as may be provided  by the Commissioner (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), repayment  of the allocated amount without further income tax consequences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USD, a United States  corporation, buys Product from its foreign parent, FP. In reviewing  USD's income tax return, the district director determines that the arm's  length price would have increased USD's taxable income by $5 million.  The district director accordingly adjusts USD's income to reflect its  true taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(b)</em> of this  chapter), to treat the $5 million adjustment as an account receivable  from FP, due as of the last day of the year of the transaction, with  interest accruing therefrom.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Setoffs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If an allocation is made under section  482 with respect to a transaction between controlled taxpayers, the  Commissioner will take into account the effect of any other non-arm's  length transaction between the same controlled taxpayers in the same  taxable year which will result in a setoff against the original section  482 allocation. Such setoff, however, will be taken into account only if  the requirements of paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section are satisfied.  If the effect of the setoff is to change the characterization or source  of the income or deductions, or otherwise distort taxable income, in  such a manner as to affect the U.S. tax liability of any member,  adjustments will be made to reflect the correct amount of each category  of income or deductions. For purposes of this setoff provision, the term  arm's length refers to the amount defined in paragraph (b) of this  section (arm's length standard), without regard to the rules in  Sec. 1.482-2(a) that treat certain interest rates as arm's length rates  of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements. The district director will take a setoff into  account only if the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Establishes that the transaction that is the basis of the setoff  was not at arm's length and the amount of the appropriate arm's length  charge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Documents, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, all  correlative adjustments resulting from the proposed setoff; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Notifies the district director of the basis of any claimed  setoff within 30 days after the earlier of the date of a letter by which  the district director transmits an examination report notifying the  taxpayer of proposed adjustments or the date of the issuance of the  notice of deficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (g)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P, a U.S. corporation, renders construction services to  S, its foreign subsidiary in Country Y, in connection with the  construction of S's factory. An arm's length charge for such services  determined under Sec. 1.482-9 would be $100,000. During the same taxable  year P makes available to S the use of a machine to be used in the  construction of the factory, and the arm's length rental value of the  machine is $25,000. P bills S $125,000 for the services, but does not  charge S for the use of the machine. No allocation will be made with  respect to the undercharge for the machine if P notifies the district  director of the basis of the claimed setoff within 30 days after the  date of the letter from the district director transmitting the  examination report notifying P of the proposed adjustment, establishes  that the excess amount charged for services was equal to an arm's length  charge for the use of the machine and that the taxable income and income  tax liabilities of P are not distorted, and documents the correlative  allocations resulting from the proposed setoff.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, if P  had reported $25,000 as rental income and $25,000 less as service  income, it would have been subject to the tax on personal holding  companies. Allocations will be made to reflect the correct amounts of  rental income and service income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Small taxpayer safe harbor. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of foreign legal restrictions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The  district director will take into account the effect of a foreign legal  restriction to the extent that such restriction affects the results of  transactions at arm's length. Thus, a foreign legal restriction will be  taken into account only to the extent that it is shown that the  restriction affected   an uncontrolled taxpayer under comparable circumstances for a comparable  period of time. In the absence of evidence indicating the effect of the  foreign legal restriction on uncontrolled taxpayers, the restriction  will be taken into account only to the extent provided in paragraphs  (h)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section (Deferred income method of  accounting).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (A) through (D) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The restrictions are publicly promulgated, generally applicable  to all similarly situated persons (both controlled and uncontrolled),  and not imposed as part of a commercial transaction between the taxpayer  and the foreign sovereign;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The taxpayer (or other member of the controlled group with  respect to which the restrictions apply) has exhausted all remedies  prescribed by foreign law or practice for obtaining a waiver of such  restrictions (other than remedies that would have a negligible prospect  of success if pursued);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The restrictions expressly prevented the payment or receipt, in  any form, of part or all of the arm's length amount that would otherwise  be required under section 482 (for example, a restriction that applies  only to the deductibility of an expense for tax purposes is not a  restriction on payment or receipt for this purpose); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The related parties subject to the restriction did not engage in  any arrangement with controlled or uncontrolled parties that had the  effect of circumventing the restriction, and have not otherwise violated  the restriction in any material respect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirement for electing the deferred income method of  accounting. If a foreign legal restriction prevents the payment or  receipt of part or all of the arm's length amount that is due with  respect to a controlled transaction, the restricted amount may be  treated as deferrable if the following requirements are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The controlled taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the  district director that the payment or receipt of the arm's length amount  was prevented because of a foreign legal restriction and circumstances  described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> if it satisfies the requirements of a qualified amended  return for purposes of Sec. 1.6664-2(c)(3) as set forth in those  regulations or as the Commissioner may prescribe by applicable revenue  procedures. The election statement must identify the affected  transactions, the parties to the transactions, and the applicable  foreign legal restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, deductions  (including the cost or other basis of inventory and other assets sold or  exchanged) and credits properly chargeable against any amount so  deferred, are subject to deferral under the provisions of Sec. 1.461-  1(a)(4). In addition, income is deferrable under this deferred income  method of accounting only to the extent that it exceeds the related  deductions already claimed in open taxable years to which the foreign  legal restriction applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples, in which Sub is a Country FC  subsidiary of U.S. corporation, Parent, illustrate this paragraph  (h)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Parent licenses an intangible to Sub. FC law generally  prohibits payments by any person within FC to recipients outside the  country. The FC law meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of  this section. There is no evidence of unrelated parties entering into  transactions under comparable circumstances for a comparable period of  time, and the foreign legal restrictions will not be taken into account  in determining the arm's length amount. The arm's length royalty rate  for the use of the intangible property in the absence of the foreign  restriction is 10% of Sub's sales in country FC. However, because the  requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section are satisfied,  Parent can elect the deferred income method of accounting by attaching  to its timely filed U.S. income tax return a written statement that  satisfies the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Sub, although it makes no royalty payment to Parent, arranges with an  unrelated intermediary to make payments equal to an arm's length amount  on its behalf to Parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(D)</em> of this section are not satisfied. Thus, Parent  could not validly elect the deferred income method of accounting, and  the allocation of royalty income cannot be treated as deferrable. In  appropriate circumstances, the district director may permit the amount  of the distribution to be treated as payment by Sub of the royalty  allocated to Parent, under the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1(g) (Collateral  adjustments).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  laws of FC do not prevent distributions from corporations to their  shareholders. Sub distributes an amount equal to 8% of its sales in  country FC. Because the laws of FC did not expressly prevent all forms  of payment from Sub to Parent, Parent cannot validly elect the deferred  income method of accounting with respect to any of the arm's length  royalty amount. In appropriate circumstances, the district director may  permit the 8% that was distributed to be treated as payment by Sub of  the royalty allocated to Parent, under the provisions of Sec. 1.482-1(g)  (Collateral adjustments).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Country FC law permits the payment of a royalty, but limits the amount  to 5% of sales, and Sub pays the 5% royalty to Parent. Parent  demonstrates the existence of a comparable uncontrolled transaction for  purposes of the comparable uncontrolled transaction method in which an  uncontrolled party accepted a royalty rate of 5%. Given the evidence of  the comparable uncontrolled transaction, the 5% royalty rate is  determined to be the arm's length royalty rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with section 936--(i) Cost sharing under section  936. If a possessions corporation makes an election under section  936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I), the corporation must make a section 936 cost sharing  payment that is at least equal to the payment that would be required  under section 482 if the electing corporation were a foreign  corporation. In determining the payment that would be required under  section 482 for this purpose, the provisions of Secs. 1.482-1 and 1.482- 4 will be applied, and to the extent relevant to the valuation of  intangibles, Secs. 1.482-5 and 1.482-6 will be applied. The provisions  of section 936(h)(5)(C)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(II)</em> (Effect of Election--electing corporation  treated as owner of intangible property) do not apply until the payment  that would be required under section 482 has been determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(I)</em>, is calculated using the provisions of  section 936 and the regulations thereunder, not section 482 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(10)</em> of this section apply to this section and Secs. 1.482-2  through 1.482-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Organization includes an organization of any kind, whether a  sole proprietorship, a partnership, a trust, an estate, an association,  or a corporation (as each is defined or understood in the Internal  Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder), irrespective of the place  of organization, operation, or   conduct of the trade or business, and regardless of whether it is a  domestic or foreign organization, whether it is an exempt organization,  or whether it is a member of an affiliated group that files a  consolidated U.S. income tax return, or a member of an affiliated group  that does not file a consolidated U.S. income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trade or business includes a trade or business activity of any  kind, regardless of whether or where organized, whether owned  individually or otherwise, and regardless of the place of operation.  Employment for compensation will constitute a separate trade or business  from the employing trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayer means any person, organization, trade or business,  whether or not subject to any internal revenue tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Controlled includes any kind of control, direct or indirect,  whether legally enforceable or not, and however exercisable or  exercised, including control resulting from the actions of two or more  taxpayers acting in concert or with a common goal or purpose. It is the  reality of the control that is decisive, not its form or the mode of its  exercise. A presumption of control arises if income or deductions have  been arbitrarily shifted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Controlled taxpayer means any one of two or more taxpayers owned  or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, and includes  the taxpayer that owns or controls the other taxpayers. Uncontrolled  taxpayer means any one of two or more taxpayers not owned or controlled  directly or indirectly by the same interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Group, controlled group, and group of controlled taxpayers mean  the taxpayers owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same  interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transaction means any sale, assignment, lease, license, loan,  advance, contribution, or any other transfer of any interest in or a  right to use any property (whether tangible or intangible, real or  personal) or money, however such transaction is effected, and whether or  not the terms of such transaction are formally documented. A transaction  also includes the performance of any services for the benefit of, or on  behalf of, another taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Controlled transaction or controlled transfer means any  transaction or transfer between two or more members of the same group of  controlled taxpayers. The term uncontrolled transaction means any  transaction between two or more taxpayers that are not members of the  same group of controlled taxpayers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> True taxable income means, in the case of a controlled taxpayer,  the taxable income that would have resulted had it dealt with the other  member or members of the group at arm's length. It does not mean the  taxable income resulting to the controlled taxpayer by reason of the  particular contract, transaction, or arrangement the controlled taxpayer  chose to make (even though such contract, transaction, or arrangement is  legally binding upon the parties thereto).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Uncontrolled comparable means the uncontrolled transaction or  uncontrolled taxpayer that is compared with a controlled transaction or  taxpayer under any applicable pricing methodology. Thus, for example,  under the comparable profits method, an uncontrolled comparable is any  uncontrolled taxpayer from which data is used to establish a comparable  operating profit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The regulations in this are generally  effective for taxable years beginning after October 6, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxpayers may elect to apply retroactively all of the provisions  of these regulations for any open taxable year. Such election will be  effective for the year of the election and all subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Although these regulations are generally effective for taxable  years as stated, the final sentence of section 482 (requiring that the  income with respect to transfers or licenses of intangible property be  commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible) is  generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.  For the period prior to the effective date of these regulations, the  final sentence of section 482 must be applied using any reasonable  method not inconsistent with the statute. The IRS considers a method  that applies these regulations or their general principles to be a  reasonable method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> These regulations will not apply with respect to transfers made  or licenses granted to foreign persons before November 17, 1985, or  before August 17, 1986, for transfers or licenses to others.  Nevertheless, they will apply with respect to transfers or licenses  before such dates if, with respect to property transferred pursuant to  an earlier and continuing transfer agreement, such property was not in  existence or owned by the taxpayer on such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The last sentences of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(1) of this  section and of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Sec. 1.482-5 apply for taxable  years beginning on or after August 26, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (d)(3)(ii)(C) Example 3,  Example 4, Example 5, and Example 6, (d)(3)(v), (f)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>,  (f)(2)(iii)(B), (g)(4)(i), (g)(4)(iii), and </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section are  generally applicable for taxable years beginning after July 31, 2009.
