                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sales. Although cash sales are preferred in the sale of  chattels, credit sales may be used advantageously in the sale of  chattels to eligible purchasers and to facilitate sales of high-priced  chattels. Chattel sales will be made to eligible purchasers in  accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Preference will be given  to a cash offer which is at least * percent of the highest offer  requiring credit. (*Refer to exhibit B of FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 440.1 (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) for the current  percentage.) Credit sales made to ineligible purchasers will require not  less than a 10 percent downpayment with the remaining balance amortized  over a period not to exceed 5 years. The interest rate for ineligible  purchasers will be the current ineligible interest rate for Farmer  Programs property set forth in exhibit B of FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 440.1 (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 431-2, in conjunction with  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-32,  ``Request for Statement of Debts and Collateral,'' may be used to show  financial capability. For Farmer Programs, County Supervisors, District  Directors, and State Directors are authorized to approve or disapprove  chattel sales on eligible terms in accordance with the respective loan  approval authorities in exhibit C of FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1901-A (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Applicants who have  been determined ineligible, and eligible applicants who have their  application disapproved, will be notified of the opportunity to appeal  in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of   this chapter. County Supervisors, District Directors, and State  Directors are authorized to approve or disapprove chattel sales on  ineligible terms in accordance with the respective type of program  approval authorities in exhibit E of FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1901-A (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receipt of payment. Payment will be by cashier's check,  certified check, postal or bank money order or personal check (not in  excess of $500) made payable to the agency. Cash may be accepted if it  is not possible for one of these forms of payment to be used. Third  party checks are not acceptable. If full payment is not received at the  time of sale, the offer will be documented by Form RD 1955-45 or Form RD  1955-46 where the chattel is sold jointly with real estate by regular  sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfer of title. Title will be transferred to a purchaser in  accordance with Sec. 1955.141(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting sale. Sales will be reported in accordance with Sec.  1955.142 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting and disposal of inventory property not sold. Refer to  Sec. Sec. 1955.143 and 1955.144 of this subpart for additional guidance  in disposing of problem property.
