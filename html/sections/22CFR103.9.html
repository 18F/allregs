If, following the issuance of such a letter of intent to charge, the Department of Commerce and respondent reach an agreement to settle a

case, the Department of Commerce will recommend the proposed settlement to the Secretary. If the recommended settlement is in accordance with applicable law the Secretary will approve and sign it.
