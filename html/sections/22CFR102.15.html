                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In so far as local law permits, the Foreign Service representative  should see that arrangements are made (by the airline representative  with the local authorities, if a scheduled carrier is involved) for the  protection of the wrecked aircraft and its property contents against  further damage, pilferage, and access by unauthorized persons, until the  arrival of the accident investigation personnel. The prior removal of  any of the wreckage or the contents of the aircraft should be prevented  unless such action is necessitated by very compelling reasons, such as  the need for treating the injured or for removing bodies, or when the  wreckage constitutes a public hazard. When under the latter conditions  the wreckage and contents of the aircraft must be moved or disturbed in  any way, if possible, a record should be made or photographs taken  showing the position and condition of the wreckage prior to disturbance.  In the case of a private aircraft or non-scheduled carrier, protection  should be arranged for the wrecked aircraft and its contents pending the  receipt of information from the Department as to whether the Civil  Aeronautics Board will investigate the case, and until   final disposition is made of the property. If the owner of a private  aircraft is killed in the wreck and is a United States citizen, the  aircraft constitutes part of his personal estate and should be disposed  of in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 72.15 to 72.55 of  this chapter. For rules governing the payment of expenses in connection  with the protection and preservation of wrecked United States aircraft,  see Sec. 102.11.</p>
