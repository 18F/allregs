This Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) applies to the following persons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All U.S. air carriers and U.S. commercial operators;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except such persons operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except where the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flight prohibition. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, no person described in paragraph (a) of this section may conduct flight operations in the Simferopol (UKFV) FIR or the Dnipropetrovsk (UKDV) FIR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permitted operations. This section does not prohibit persons described in paragraph (a) of this section from conducting flight operations in either or both of the Simferopol (UKFV) and the Dnipropetrovsk (UKDV) FIRs, provided that such flight operations are conducted under a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement with a department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. government (or under a subcontract between the prime contractor of the department, agency, or instrumentality, and the person subject to paragraph (a)), with the approval of the FAA, or under an exemption issued by the FAA. The FAA will process requests for approval or exemption in a timely manner, with the order of preference being: First, for those operations in support of U.S. government-sponsored activities; second, for those operations in support of government-sponsored activities of a foreign country with the support of a U.S. government department, agency, or instrumentality; and third, for all other operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency situations.

Except for U.S. air carriers and commercial operators that are subject to the requirements of 14 CFR parts 119, 121, 125, or 135, each person who deviates from this section must, within 10 days of the deviation, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays, submit to the nearest FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) a complete report of the operations of the aircraft involved in the deviation, including a description of the deviation and the reasons for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expiration. This SFAR will remain in effect until October 27, 2015. The FAA may amend, rescind, or extend this SFAR as necessary.
