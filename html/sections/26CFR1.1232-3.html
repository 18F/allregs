May 27, 1969--(i) General rule. Under section 1232(a)(2)(A), in the case of gain realized upon the sale or exchange of an obligation issued at a discount by a corporation after May 27, 1969 (other than an obligation subject to the transitional rule of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph), and held by the taxpayer for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If at the time of original issue there was no intention to call the obligation before maturity, such gain shall be considered as long-term capital gain, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If at the time of original issue there was an intention to call the obligation before maturity, such gain shall be considered ordinary income to the extent it does not exceed the excess of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An amount equal to the entire original issue discount, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An amount equal to the entire original issue discount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the number of complete months and any fractional part of a month elapsed since the date of original issue and the denominator of which is the number of complete months and any fractional part of a month from the date of original issue to the stated maturity date.
The balance, if any, of the gain shall be considered as long-term capital gain. The amount described in (2) of this subdivision (b) in effect reduces the amount of original issue discount to be treated as ordinary income under this subdivision (b) by the amounts previously includible (regardless of whether included) by all holders (computed, however, as to any holder without regard to any purchase allowance under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1232-3A and without regard to whether any holder purchased at a premium as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1232-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cross references. For definition of the terms original issue discount and intention to call before maturity, see paragraphs (b) (1) and (4) respectively of this section. For definition of the term date of original issue, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For computation of the number of complete months and any fractional portion of a month, see paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.1232-3A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of section 582(c). Gain shall not be considered to be long-term capital gain under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph if section 582(c) (relating to treatment of losses and gains on bonds of certain financial institutions) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 1970, A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases at original issue for cash of $7,600, M Corporation's 10-year, 5 percent bond which has a stated redemption price at maturity of $10,000. On January 1, 1972, A sells the bond to B, for $9,040. A has previously included $480 of the original issue discount in his gross income (see example (1) of paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1232-3A) and increased his basis in the bond by that amount to $8,080 (see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1232-3A). Thus, if at the time of original issue there was no intention to call the bond before maturity, A's gain of $960 (amount realized, $9,040, less adjusted basis, $8,080) is considered long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that at the time of original issue there was an intention to call the bond before maturity. The amount of the entire gain includible by A as ordinary income under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is determined as follows:
(1) Entire original issue discount (stated redemption price       $2,400</p><p class="depth0">at maturity, $10,000, minus issue price, $7,600)...........(2) Less: Line (1), $2,400, multiplied by months elapsed            $480</p><p class="depth0">since date of original issue, 24, divided by months from</p><p class="depth0">such date to stated maturity date, 120.....................</p><p class="depth0">-----------(3) Maximum amount includible by A as ordinary income.......      $1,920</p><p class="depth0">Since the amount in line (3) is greater than A's gain, $960, A's entire gain is includible as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On January 1, 1979, B, a calendar-year taxpayer, sells the bond to C for $10,150. Assume that B has included $120 of original issue discount in his gross income for each taxable year he held the bond (see example (2) of paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1232-3A) and therefore increased his basis by $840 (i.e., $120 each yearx7 years) to $9,880. B's gain is therefore $270 (amount realized, $10,150, less basis, $9,880). The amount of such gain includible by B as ordinary income under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is determined as follows:
(1) Entire original issue discount (as determined in part         $2,400</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this example).......................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Less: Line (1), $2,400, multiplied by months elapsed          $2,160</p><p class="depth0">since date of original issue, 108, divided by months from</p><p class="depth0">such date to stated maturity date, 120.....................</p><p class="depth0">-----------(3) Maximum amount includible by B as ordinary income.......        $240</p><p class="depth0">Since the amount in line (3) is less than B's gain, $270, only $240 of B's gain is includible as ordinary income. The remaining portion of B's gain, $30, is considered long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obligations issued by a corporation on or before May 27, 1969, and government obligations. Under section 1232(a)(2)(B), if gain is realized on the sale or exchange after December 31, 1957, of an obligation held by the taxpayer more than 6 months, and if the obligation either was issued at a discount after December 31, 1954, and on or before May 27, 1969, by a corporation or was issued at a discount after December 31, 1954, by or on behalf of the United States or a foreign country, or a political subdivision of either, then such gain shall be considered ordinary income to the extent it does not exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount equal to the entire original issue discount, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If at the time of original issue there was no intention to call the obligation before maturity, a portion of the original issue discount determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section,
And the balance, if any, of the gain shall be considered as long-term capital gain. For the definition of the terms original issue discount and intention to call before maturity, see paragraphs (b) (1) and (4) respectively of this section. See section 1037(b) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1037-1 for special rules which are applicable in applying section 1232(a)(2)(B) and this subparagraph to gain realized on the disposition or redemption of obligations of the United States which were received from the United States in an exchange upon which gain or loss is not recognized because of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transitional rule. Subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (in lieu of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) shall apply to an obligation issued by a corporation pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on May 27, 1969, and at all times thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Obligations issued after December 31, 1954, and sold or exchanged before January 1, 1958. Gain realized upon the sale or exchange before January 1, 1958, of an obligation issued at a discount after December 31, 1954, and held by the taxpayer for more than 6 months, shall be considered ordinary income to the extent it equals a specified portion of the original issue discount, and the balance, if any, of the gain shall be considered as long-term capital gain. The term original issue discount is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The computation of the amount of gain which constitutes ordinary income is illustrated in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Obligations issued before January 1, 1955. Whether gain representing original issue discount realized upon the sale or exchange of obligations issued at a discount before January 1, 1955, is capital gain or ordinary income shall be determined without reference to section 1232.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Original issue discount--(i) In general. For purposes of section 1232, the term original issue discount means the difference between the issue price and the stated redemption price at maturity. The stated redemption price is determined without regard to optional call dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Original issue discount--(i) In general. For purposes of section 1232, the term original issue discount means the difference between the issue price and the stated redemption price at maturity. The stated redemption price is determined without regard to optional call dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 1232, the term original issue discount means the difference between the issue price and the stated redemption price at maturity. The stated redemption price is determined without regard to optional call dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> De minimis rule. If the original issue discount is less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity, then the discount shall be considered to be zero. For example, a 10-year bond with a stated redemption price at maturity of $100 issued at $98 would be regarded as having an original issue discount of zero. Thus, any gain realized by the holder would be a long-term capital gain if the bond was a capital asset in the hands of the holder and held by him for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977). However, if the bond were issued at $97.50 or less, the original issue discount would not be considered zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stated redemption price at maturity--(a) Definition. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision (iii),

the term stated redemption price at maturity means the amount fixed by the last modification of the purchase agreement, including dividends, interest, and any other amounts, however designated, payable at that time. If any amount based on a fixed rate of simple or compound interest is actually payable or will be treated as constructively received under section 451 and the regulations thereunder either: (1) At fixed periodic intervals of one year or less during the entire term of an obligation, or (2) except as provided in subdivision (e) of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), at maturity in the case of an obligation with a term of one year or less, any such amount payable at maturity shall not be included in determining the stated redemption price at maturity. For purposes of subdivision (a)(2) of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the term of an obligation shall include any renewal period with respect to which, under the terms of the obligation, the holder may either take action or refrain from taking action which would prevent the actual or constructive receipt of any interest on such obligation until the expiration of any such renewal period. To illustrate this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), assume that a note which promises to pay $1,000 at the end of three years provides for additional amounts labeled as interest to be paid at the rate of $50 at the end of the first year, $50 at the end of the second year, and $120 at the end of the third year. The stated redemption price at maturity will be $1,070 since only $50 of the $120 payable at the end of the third year is based on a fixed rate of simple or compound interest. If, however, the $120 were payable at the end of the second year, so that only $50 in addition to principal would be payable at the end of the third year, then under the rule for serial obligations contained in subparagraph (2)(iv)(c) of this paragraph, the $1,000 note is treated as consisting of two series. The first series is treated as maturing at the end of the second year at a stated redemption price of $70. The second series is treated as maturing at the end of the third year at a stated redemption price of $1,000. For the calculation of issue price and the allocation of original issue discount with respect to each such series, see example (3) of subparagraph (2)(iv)(f) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules. In the case of face -amount certificates, the redemption price at maturity is the price as modified through changes such as extensions of the purchase agreement and includes any dividends which are payable at maturity. In the case of an obligation issued as part of an investment unit consisting of such obligation and an option (which is not excluded by (c) of this subdivision (iii)), security, or other property, the term stated redemption price at maturity means the amount payable on maturity in respect of the obligation, and does not include any amount payable in respect of the option, security, or other property under a repurchase agreement or option to buy or sell the option, security, or other property. For application of this subdivision to certain deposits in financial institutions, see paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1232-3A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excluded option. An option is excluded by this subdivision (c) if it is an option to which paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.61-15 applies or if it is an option, referred to in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.83-7, granted in connection with performance of services to which section 421 does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Obligation issued in installments. If an obligation is issued by a corporation under terms whereby the holder makes installment payments, then the stated redemption price for each installment payment shall be computed in a manner consistent with the rules contained in subparagraph (2)(iv) of this paragraph for computing the issue price for each series of a serial obligation. For application of this subdivision (d) to certain open account deposit arrangements, see examples (1) and (2) of paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of Sec. 1.1232-3A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Application of definition. Subdivision (a)(2) of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) shall not apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For taxable years beginning before September 19, 1979, if for the issuer's last taxable year beginning before September 19, 1978, the rules of Sec. 1.163-4 were properly applied by the issuer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an obligation with a term of six months or less held by a nonresident alien individual or foreign

corporation, but only for purposes of the appliction of sections 871 and 881.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Carryover of original issue discount. If in pursuance of a plan of reorganization an obligation is received in an exchange for another obligation, and if gain or loss is not recognized in whole or in part on such exchange of obligations by reason, for example, of section 354 or 356, then the obligation received shall be considered to have the same original issue discount as the obligation surrendered reduced by the amount of gain (if any) recognized as ordinary income upon such exchange of obligations, and by the amount of original issue discount with respect to the obligation surrendered which was included as interest income under the ratable inclusion rules of sections 1232(a)(3) and 1.1232-3A. If inclusion as interest of the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount is required under section 1232(a)(3) with respect to the obligation received, see paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of Sec. 1.1232-3A for computation of the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount. For special rules in connection with certain exchanges of U.S. obligations, see section 1037.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issue price defined--(i) In general. The term issue price in the case of obligations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission means the initial offering price to the public at which price a substantial amount of such obligations were sold. For this purpose, the term the public does not include bond houses and brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers. Ordinarily, the issue price will be the first price at which the obligations were sold to the public, and the issue price will not change if, due to market developments, part of the issue must be sold at a different price. When obligations are privately placed, the issue price of each obligation is the price paid by the first buyer of the particular obligation, irrespective of the issue price of the remainder of the issue. In the case of an obligation issued by a foreign obligor, the issue price shall be increased by the amount, if any, of interest equalization tax paid under section 4911 (and not credited, refunded, or reimbursed) on the acquisition of the obligation by the first buyer. In the case of an obligation which is convertible into stock or another obligation, the issue price includes any amount paid in respect of the conversion privilege. However, in the case of an obligation issued as part of an investment unit (as defined in subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph), the issue price of the obligation includes only that portion of the initial offering price or price paid by the first buyer properly allocable to the obligation under the rules prescribed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The terms initial offering price and price paid by the first buyer include the aggregate payments made by the purchaser under the purchase agreement, including modifications thereof. Thus, all amounts paid by the purchaser under the purchase agreement or a modification of it are included in the issue price (but in the case of an obligation issued as part of an investment unit, only to the extent allocable to such obligation under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), such as amounts paid upon face-amount certificates or installment trust certificates in which the purchaser contracts to make a series of payments which will be returnable to the holder with an increment at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term issue price in the case of obligations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission means the initial offering price to the public at which price a substantial amount of such obligations were sold. For this purpose, the term the public does not include bond houses and brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers. Ordinarily, the issue price will be the first price at which the obligations were sold to the public, and the issue price will not change if, due to market developments, part of the issue must be sold at a different price. When obligations are privately placed, the issue price of each obligation is the price paid by the first buyer of the particular obligation, irrespective of the issue price of the remainder of the issue.

In the case of an obligation which is convertible into stock or another obligation, the issue price includes any amount paid in respect of the conversion privilege. However, in the case of an obligation issued as part of an investment unit (as defined in subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph), the issue price of the obligation includes only that portion of the initial offering price or price paid by the first buyer properly allocable to the obligation under the rules prescribed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The terms initial offering price and price paid by the first buyer include the aggregate payments made by the purchaser under the purchase agreement, including modifications thereof. Thus, all amounts paid by the purchaser under the purchase agreement or a modification of it are included in the issue price (but in the case of an obligation issued as part of an investment unit, only to the extent allocable to such obligation under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), such as amounts paid upon face-amount certificates or installment trust certificates in which the purchaser contracts to make a series of payments which will be returnable to the holder with an increment at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Investment units consisting of obligations and property--(a) In general. An investment unit, within the meaning of this subdivision (ii) and for purposes of section 1232, consists of an obligation and an option, security, or other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the initial offering price of an investment unit shall be allocated to the individual elements of the unit on the basis of their respective fair market values. However, if the fair market value of the option, security, or other property is not readily ascertainable (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.421-6), then the portion of the initial offering price or price paid by the first buyer of the unit which is allocable to the obligation issued as part of such unit shall be ascertained as of the time of acquisition of such unit by reference to the assumed price at which such obligation would have been issued had it been issued apart from such unit. The assumed price of the obligation shall be ascertained by comparison to the

yields at which obligations of a similar character which are not issued as part of an investment unit are sold in arm's length transactions, and by adjusting the price of the obligation in question to this yield. The adjustment may be made by subtracting from the face amount of the obligation the total present value of the interest foregone by the purchaser as a result of purchasing the obligation at a lower yield as part of an investment unit. In most cases, assumed price may also be determined in a similar manner through the use of standard bond tables. Any reasonable method may be used in selecting an obligation for comparative purposes. Obligations of the same grade and classification shall be used to the extent possible, and proper regard shall be given, with respect to both the obligation in question and the comparative obligation, to the solvency of the issuer, the nature of the issuer's trade or business, the presence and nature of security for the obligation, the geographic area in which the loan is made, and all other factors relevant to the circumstances. An obligation which is convertible into stock or another obligation must not be used as a comparative obligation (except where the investment unit contains an obligation convertible into stock or another obligation), since such an obligation would not reflect the yield attributable solely to the obligation element of the investment unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Agreement as to assumed price. In the case of an investment unit which is privately placed, the assumed price at which the obligation would have been issued had it been issued apart from such unit may be agreed to by the issuer and the original purchaser of the investment unit in writing on or before the date of purchase. Alternatively, an agreement between the issuer and original purchaser may specify the rate of interest which would have been paid on the obligation if the transaction were one not involving the issuance of options, and an assumed issue price may be determined (in the manner described in (a) of this subdivision) from such agreed assumed rate of interest. An assumed price based upon such an agreement between the parties will generally be presumed to be the issue price of the obligation with respect to the issuer, original purchaser, and all subsequent holders: Provided, That the agreement was made in arm's length negotiations between parties having adverse interests: And, provided further, That such price does not, under the rules stated in (a) of this subdivision, appear to be clearly erroneous. An assumed issue price agreed to by the parties as provided herein will not be considered clearly erroneous if it is not less than the face value adjusted (in the manner described in (a) of this subdivision) to a yield which is one percentage point greater than the actual rate of interest payable on the obligation. Similarly, if the agreement between the parties specifies an agreed assumed rate of interest (in lieu of an agreed assumed issue price) and such agreed rate is not more than 1 percentage point greater than the actual rate payable on the obligation, an adjusted issue price based upon such agreed assumed rate of interest will not be considered clearly erroneous.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cross references. For rules relating to the deductibility by the issuing corporation of bond discount resulting from an allocation under the rule stated in (a) of this subdivision, see Sec. Sec. 1.163-3 and 1.163-4. For rules relating to the basis of obligations and options, securities, or other property acquired in investment units, see Sec. 1.1012-1(d). For rules relating to certain reporting requirements with respect to options acquired in connection with evidences of indebtedness and for the tax treatment of such options, see Sec. 1.61-15, and section 1234 and the regulations thereunder. With respect to the tax consequences to the issuing corporation upon the exercise of options issued in connection with evidences of indebtedness to which this section applies, see section 1032 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of the principles set forth in this subdivision (ii) may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that there was no intention to call the note before maturity:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M Corporation is a small manufacturer of electronic components located in the southwestern United States. On January 1, 1969, in consideration for the payment of

$41,500, M issues to X its unsecured note for $40,000 together with warrants to purchase 3,000 shares of M stock at $10 per share at any time during the term of the note. The note is payable in 4 years and provides for interest at the rate of 5 percent per year, payable semiannually. The fair market values of the note and the warrants are not readily ascertainable. Assume that companies in the same industry as M Corporation, and similarly situated both financially and geographically, are generally able to borrow money on their unsecured notes at an annual interest rate of 6 percent. Using a present value table, the calculation of the issue price of a 5 percent, 4 year, $40,000 note, discounted to yield 6 percent compounded semiannually is made as follows:

The note provides for interest of 6 percent, payable semiannually. The fair market values of the note and warrants are not readily ascertainable. The loan agreement between Y and N contains a provision, agreed to in arms-length bargaining between the parties, that a rate of 7 percent payable semiannually would have been applied to the loan if warrants were not issued as part of the consideration for the loan.

In this situation the agreed assumed issue price is presumed to be correct since it is not less than the face value adjusted (in the manner illustrated in part (1) of this example) to a yield which is one percentage point greater than the actual rate of interest payable on the obligation ($47,921).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. O Corporation is a small advertising company located in the northeastern United States. Z is a tax-exempt organization. In consideration for the payment of $60,000, O issues to Z, in a transaction not within the scope of section 503(b), its unsecured 5-year note for $60,000, together with warrants to purchase 6,000 shares of O stock at $10 per share at any time during the term of the note. The note is subject to quarterly amortization at the rate of $3,000 per quarter, and provides for interest on the outstanding unpaid balance at an annual rate of 6 percent payable quarterly (1\1/2\ percent per quarter). The fair market values of the notes and warrants are not readily ascertainable. The loan agreement between O and Z contains a recital that if the $60,000 note had been issued without the warrants only $45,000 would have been paid for it. An examination of relevant facts indicates that companies in the same industry as O Corporation, and similarly situated both financially and geographically, are able to borrow money on their unsecured notes at an annual interest cost of 8\1/2\ percent payable quarterly (2\1/8\ percent per quarter). By reference to a present value table, it is found that the present value of O's note discounted to yield 8\1/2\ percent compounded quarterly is $56,608 (rounded). The computation is as follows:

This amount ($56,608) is the assumed price at which the note would have been issued had it been issued without stock purchase warrants. The assumed price of $45,000 agreed to by the parties is not presumed to be correct since it is less than the face value adjusted to a yield which is one percentage point greater than the actual rate of interest payable on the obligation. The parties did not have adverse interests in agreeing upon an assumed price (since an excessively large amount of original issue discount would benefit O, the borrower, without adversely affecting Z, an exempt organization which would pay no tax on original issue discount income), and the price agreed to appears to be clearly erroneous when compared to the $56,608 assumed issue price determined under the principles of (a) of this subdivision. Since the maturity value of O's note is $60,000, the original issue discount on O's note is $3,392 ($60,000 minus $56,608). Under the rules in Sec. 1.163-3, O is entitled to a deduction, to be prorated or amortized over the life of the note, equal to this original issue discount on the note. The excess of the price paid for the unit over the portion of such price allocable to the note, $3,392 ($60,000 minus $56,608), is allocable to and is the basis of the stock purchase warrants acquired by Z in connection with O's note.

Except as provided in (b) of this subdivision, if an obligation or an investment unit is issued for property other than money, the issue price of such obligation shall be the stated redemption price at maturity and, therefore, no original issue discount is created as a result of the exchange. However, in such case, there may be an amount treated as interest under section 483. In the case of certain exchanges of obligations of the United States for other such obligations, see section 1037 for the determination of the amount of original issue discount on the obligation acquired in the exchange. For carryover of original issue discount in the case of certain exchanges of obligations, see subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions for original issue discount.

then the issue price of the obligation or investment unit shall be the fair market value of the property for which such obligation or investment unit is issued, as determined under (c) of this subdivision. Such issue price shall control for purposes of determining the amount realized by the person exchanging the property for the obligation or unit issued and the bases of the property acquired by the holder and issuer.
An obligation which is not traded on an established securities market and which is not part of an issue or investment unit a portion of which is so traded shall not be treated as property described in (1) of this (b) even though the obligation is convertible into property so traded. For purposes of this (b),

an obligation, investment unit, or element of an investment unit shall be treated as traded on an established securities market if it is so traded on or within 10 trading days after the date it is issued. Trading days shall mean those days on which an established securities market is open. For purposes of this subdivision (iii), the term established securities market shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (d)(4) of Sec. 1.453-3 (relating to limitations on installment method for purchaser evidences of indebtedness payable on demand or readily tradable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of fair market value in cases to which (b) of this subdivision applies. In general, for purposes of (b) of this subdivision, the fair market value of property for which an obligation or investment unit is issued shall be deemed to be the same as the fair market value of such obligation or investment unit, determined by reference to the fair market value of that portion of the issue, of which such obligation or unit is a part, which is traded on an established securities market. The fair market value of such obligation or unit shall be determined as of the first date after the date of issue (within the meaning of section 1232(b)(3)) that such obligation or unit is traded on an established securities market. If, however, the obligation or investment unit is not part of an issue a portion of which is traded on an established securities market, but the property for which the obligation or investment unit is issued is stock or securities which are traded on an established securities market, the fair market value of such property shall be the fair market value of such stock or securities on the date such obligation or unit is issued for such property. The fair market value of property for purposes of this (c) shall be determined as provided in Sec. 20.2031-2 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) but without applying the blockage and other special rules contained in paragraph (e) thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Not in reorganization.

Thus, for example, no original issue discount is created on an obligation issued in a recapitalization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(E). Similarly, no original issue discount is created on an obligation issued in an exchange, pursuant to a plan of reorganization, to which section 361 applies regardless of the income tax consequences to any person who pursuant to such plan is the ultimate recipient of the obligation.

If an issue of obligations which matures serially is issued by a corporation, and if on the basis of the facts and circumstances in such case an independent issue price for each particular maturity can be established, then the obligations with each particular maturity shall be considered a separate series, and the obligations of each such series shall be treated as a separate issue with a separate issue price, maturity date, and stated redemption price at maturity. The ratable monthly portion of original issue discount attributable to each obligation within a particular series shall be determined and ratably included as interest in gross income under the rules of Sec. 1.1232-3A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Issue price not independently established. If a separate issue price cannot be established with respect to each series of an issue of obligations which matures serially, the issue price for each obligation of each series shall be its stated redemption price at maturity minus the amount of original issue discount allocated thereto in accordance with (d) of this subdivision.

If a single corporate obligation provides for payments (other than payments which would not be included in the stated redemption price at maturity under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph) in two or more installments, the provisions of (b) of this subdivision shall be applied by treating such obligation as an issue of obligations consisting of more than one series each of which matures on the due date of each such installment payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of discount. For purposes of (b) and (c) of this subdivision, the original issue discount with respect to each series of an issue shall be the total original issue discount for the issue multiplied by a fraction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The numerator of which is the product of (i) the stated redemption price of such series and (ii) the number of complete years (and any fraction thereof) constituting the period for such series from the date of original issue (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to its stated maturity date, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The denominator of which is the sum of the products determined in (1) of this subdivision (d) with respect to each such series.

In the case of issues of obligations which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the term date of original issue means the date on which the issue was first sold to the public at the issue price.

For purposes of section 1232, the term intention to call the bond or other evidence of indebtedness before maturity means an understanding between (a) the issuing corporation (such corporation is hereinafter referred to as the issuer), and (b) the original purchaser of such obligation (or, in the case of obligations constituting part of an issue, any of the original purchasers of such obligations) that the issuer will redeem the obligation before maturity. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term original purchaser does not include persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or dealers, who purchased the obligation for resale in the ordinary course of their trade or business. It is not necessary that the issuer's intention to call the obligation before maturity be communicated directly to the original purchaser by the issuer. The understanding to call before maturity need not be unconditional; it may, for example, be dependent upon the financial condition of the issuer on the proposed early call date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Meaning of term. For purposes of section 1232, the term intention to call the bond or other evidence of indebtedness before maturity means an understanding between (a) the issuing corporation (such corporation is hereinafter referred to as the issuer), and (b) the original purchaser of such obligation (or, in the case of obligations constituting part of an issue, any of the original purchasers of such obligations) that the issuer will redeem the obligation before maturity. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term original purchaser does not include persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or dealers, who purchased the obligation for resale in the ordinary course of their trade or business. It is not necessary that the issuer's intention to call the obligation before maturity be communicated directly to the original purchaser by the issuer. The understanding to call before maturity need not be unconditional; it may, for example, be dependent upon the financial condition of the issuer on the proposed early call date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proof of intent--(a) In general. Ordinarily, the existence or non-existance of an understanding at the time of original issue that the obligation will be redeemed before maturity shall be determined by an examination of all of the circumstances under which the obligation was issued and held. The fact that the obligation is issued with provisions on its face giving the issuer the privilege of redeeming the obligation before maturity is not determinative of an intention to call before maturity; likewise, the absence of such provision is not determinative of the absence of an intention to call before maturity. However, such provision, or the absence of such provision, is one of the circumstances to be given consideration along with other factors in determining whether an understanding existed. If the obligation was part of an issue registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and was sold to the public (whether or not sold directly to the public by the obligor) without representation to the public that the obligor intends to call the obligation before maturity, there shall be a presumption that no intention to call the obligation before maturity was in existence at the time of original issue. The existence of a provision on the face of an obligation giving the issuer the privilege of redeeming the obligation before maturity shall not in and of itself overcome the presumption set forth in the preceding sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Circumstances indicating absence of understanding. Examples of circumstances which would be evidence that there was no understanding at the time of original issue to redeem the obligation before maturity are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The issue price and term of the obligation appear to be reasonable, taking into account the interest rate, if any, on the obligation, for a corporation in the financial condition of the issuer at the time of issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The original purchaser and the issuer are not related within the meaning of section 267(b) and have not engaged in transactions with each other (other than concerning the obligation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The original purchaser is not related within the meaning of section 267(b) to any of the officers or directors of the issuer, and he has not engaged in transactions with such officers or directors (other than concerning the obligation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The officers and directors of the issuer at the time of issue of the obligation are different from those in control at the time the obligation is called or the taxpayer disposes of it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gain treated as ordinary income in certain cases; computation. The amount of gain treated as ordinary income under paragraph (a) (3)(ii) or (5) of this section is computed by multiplying the original issue discount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months the obligation was held by the holder and the denominator of which is the number of full months from the date of original issue to the

date specified as the redemption date at maturity. (See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for definition of date of original issue.) The period that the obligation was held by the taxpayer shall include any period that it was held by another person if, under chapter 1 of the Code, for the purpose of determining gain or loss from a sale or exchange, the obligation has the same basis, in whole or in part, in the hands of the taxpayer as it would have in the hands of such other person. This computation is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An individual purchases a 10-year, 3-percent coupon bond for $900 on original issue on February 1, 1955, and sells it on February 20, 1960, for $940. The redemption price is $1,000. At the time of original issue, there was no intention to call the bond before maturity. The bond has been held by the taxpayer for 60 full months. (The additional days amounting to less than a full month are not taken into account.) The number of complete months from date of issue to date of maturity is 120 (10 years). The fraction \60/120\ multiplied by the discount of $100 is equal to $50, which represents the proportionate part of the original issue discount attributable to the period of ownership by the taxpayer. Accordingly, any part of the gain up to $50 will be treated as ordinary income. Therefore, in this case the entire gain of $40 is treated as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts in the preceding example, except that the selling price of the bond is $970. In this case $50 of the gain of $70 is treated as ordinary income and the balance of $20 is treated as long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the selling price of the bond is $800. In this case, the individual has a long-term capital loss of $100.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the bond is purchased by the second holder February 1, 1960, for $800. The second holder keeps it to the maturity date (February 1, 1965) when it is redeemed for $1,000. Since that holder has held the bond for 60 full months, he will, upon redemption, have $50 in ordinary income and $150 in long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to the general rule--(1) In general. Section 1232(a)(2)(C) provides that section 1232(a)(2) does not apply (i) to obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income under section 103 (relating to certain government obligations), or (ii) to any holder who purchases an obligation at a premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 1232(a)(2)(C) provides that section 1232(a)(2) does not apply (i) to obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income under section 103 (relating to certain government obligations), or (ii) to any holder who purchases an obligation at a premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Premium. For purposes of section 1232, this section, and Sec. 1.1232-3A, premium means a purchase price which exceeds the stated redemption price of an obligation at its maturity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if an obligation is acquired as part of an investment unit consisting of an option, security, or other property and an obligation, the purchase price of the obligation is that portion of the price paid or payable for the unit which is allocable to the obligation. The price paid for the unit shall be allocated to the individual elements of the unit on the basis of their respective fair market values. However, if the fair market value of the option, security, or other property is not readily ascertainable (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.421-6), then the price paid for the unit shall be allocated in accordance with the rules under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for allocating the initial offering price of an investment unit to its elements. If, under chapter 1 of the Code, the basis of an obligation in the hands of the holder is the same, in whole or in part, for the purposes of determining gain or loss from a sale or exchange, as the basis of the obligation in the hands of another person who purchased the obligation at a premium, then the holder shall be considered to have purchased the obligation at a premium. Thus, the donee of an obligation purchased at a premium by the doner will be considered a holder who purchased the obligation at a premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amounts previously includible in income. Nothing in section 1232(a)(2) shall require the inclusion of any amount previously includible in gross income. Thus, if an amount was previously includible in a taxpayer's income on account of obligations issued at a discount and redeemable for fixed amounts increasing at stated intervals, or, under section 818(b) (relating to accrual of discount on bonds and other evidences of indebtedness held by life insurance companies), such amount is not again includible in the taxpayer's gross income under section 1232(a)(2). For example, amounts includible in gross income by a cash receipts and disbursements method taxpayer who has made an election under section 454

(a) or (c) (relating to accounting rules for certain obligations issued at a discount to which section 1232(a)(3) does not apply) are not includible in gross income under section 1232(a)(2). In the case of a gain which would include, under section 1232(a)(2), an amount considered to be ordinary income and a further amount considered long-term capital gain, any amount to which this paragraph applies is first used to offset the amount considered ordinary income. For example, on January 1, 1955, A purchases a 10-year bond which is redeemable for fixed amounts increasing at stated intervals. At the time of original issue, there was no intention to call the bond before maturity. The purchase price of the bond is $75, which is also the issue price. The stated redemption price at maturity of the bond is $100. A elects to treat the annual increase in the redemption price of the bond as income pursuant to section 454(a). On January 1, 1960, A sells the bond for $90. The total stated increase in the redemption price of the bond which A has reported annually as income for the taxable years 1955 through 1959 is $7. The portion of the original issue discount of $25 attributable to this period is $12.50, computed as follows:
60 (months bond is held by A)/120 (months from date of original issue to</p><p class="depth0">redemption date)x$25 (original issue discount)

However, $7, which represents the annual stated increase taken into income, is offset against the amount of $12.50, leaving $5.50 of the gain from the sale to be treated as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. In the case of any obligation held by a taxpayer which was issued at an original issue discount after December 31, 1954, the taxpayer shall keep a record of the issue price and issue date upon or with each obligation (if known to or reasonably ascertainable by him). If the obligation held by the taxpayer is an obligation of the United States received from the United States in an exchange upon which gain or loss is not recognized because of section 1037 (a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)), the taxpayer shall keep sufficient records to determine the issue price of such obligation for purposes of applying section 1037(b) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 1.1037-1 upon the disposition or redemption of such obligation. The issuer (or in the case of obligations first sold to the public through an underwriter or wholesaler, the underwriter or wholesaler) shall mark the issue price and issue date upon every obligation which is issued at an original issue discount after September 26, 1957, but only if the period between the date of original issue (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) and the stated maturity date is more than 6 months.

Except when subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies, the term ratable monthly portion of original issue discount means an amount equal to the original issue discount divided by the sum of the number of complete months (plus any fractional part of a month) beginning on the date of original issue and ending the day before the stated maturity date of such obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduction for purchase allowance. With respect to an obligation which has been acquired by purchase (within the meaning of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph), the term ratable monthly portion of original issue discount means the lesser of the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or an amount equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The excess (if any) of the stated redemption price of the obligation at maturity over its cost to the purchaser divided by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The sum of the number of complete months (plus any fractional part of a month) beginning on the date of such purchase and ending the day before the stated maturity date of such obligation.

In any case in which there is a carryover of original issue discount under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.1232-3 from an obligation exchanged to an obligation received in such exchange, the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount in respect of the obligation received shall be computed by dividing the amount of original issue discount carried over by the sum of the number of complete months (plus any fractional part of a month) beginning on the date of the exchange and ending the day before the stated maturity date of the obligation received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cross references.

On January 1, 1970, A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases at original issue, for cash of $7,600, M Corporation's 10-year, 5-percent bond which has a stated redemption price of $10,000. The ratable monthly portion of original issue discount, as determined under section 1232(a)(3) and this section, to be included as interest in A's gross income for each month he holds such bond is $20, computed as follows:
Original issue discount (stated redemption price,      $2,400</p><p class="depth0">$10,000, minus issue price, $7,600)..............Divide by: Number of months from date of original         120     months</p><p class="depth0">issue to stated maturity date....................</p><p class="depth0">-----------Ratable monthly portion...........................        $20</p><p class="depth0">Assume that A holds the bond for all of 1970 and 1971 and includes as interest in his gross income for each such year an amount equal to the ratable monthly portion, $20, multiplied by the number of months he held the bond each such year, 12 months, or $240. Accordingly, on January 1, 1972, A's basis in the bond will have increased under paragraph (c) of this section by the amount so included, $480 (i.e., $240x2), from his cost, $7,600, to $8,080.

Since B purchased the bond, he determines under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section the amount of the ratable monthly portion he must include as interest in his gross income in order to reflect the amount of his purchase allowance (if any). B determines that his ratable monthly portion is $10, computed as follows:

Since C is now the holder of the bond (and no exception applies to him), he must include as interest in his gross income the ratable monthly portion of original issue determined

under section 1232(a)(3) and this section. Since C purchased the bond he determines under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section the amount of the ratable monthly portion he must include as interest in his gross income in order to reflect the amount of his purchase allowance (if any).

Upon maturity of the bond on January 1, 1980, C will receive $10,000 from M, which under paragraph (c) of this section will equal his adjusted basis (the sum of his cost, $9,940, plus original issue discount included as interest in his gross income, $60).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On January 1, 1968, D, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases at original issue, for cash of $8,000, P Corporation's 20-year, 6 percent bond which has a stated redemption price of $10,000 and which will mature on January 1, 1988. The original issue discount with respect to such bond is $2,000. However, the ratable inclusion rules of section 1232(a)(3) do not apply to D, since the bond was issued by P before May 28, 1969. On January 1, 1973, pursuant to a plan of reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(E), and in which no gain or loss is recognized by D under section 354, D's 20-year bond is exchanged for a 10-year, 6 percent bond which also has a stated redemption price of $10,000 but will mature on January 1, 1983. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.1232-3, the $2,000 of original issue discount is carried over to the new 10-year bond received in such exchange. Since the new bond is an obligation issued after May 27, 1969, D is required to begin ratable inclusion of the $2,000 of discount as interest in his gross income for 1973. The ratable monthly portion of original issue discount, as determined under section 1232(a)(3) to be included as interest in gross income is computed as follows:

The application of section 1232 to obligations to which this paragraph applies may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A is a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On January 1, 1971, he purchases a certificate of deposit from X Bank, a corporation, for $10,000. The certificate of deposit is not redeemable until December 31, 1975, except in an emergency as defined in, and subject to the qualifications provided by, Regulation Q of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. See 12 CFR 217.4(d). The stated redemption price at maturity is $13,382.26. The terms of the certificate do not expressly refer to any amount as interest. A's certificate of deposit is an obligation to which section 1232 and this paragraph apply. A shall include the ratable portion of original issue discount in gross income for 1971 as determined under section 1232(a)(3). Thus, if A holds the certificate of deposit for the full calendar year 1971, the amount to be included in A's gross income for 1971 is $676.45, that is, \12/60\ months, multiplied by the excess of the stated redemption price ($13,382.26) over the issue price ($10,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the certificate of deposit provides for payment upon redemption at December 31, 1975, of an amount equal to ``$10,000, plus 6 percent compound interest from January 1, 1971, to December 31, 1975.'' Thus, the total amount payable upon redemption in both example (1) and this example is $13,382.26. The certificate of deposit is an obligation to which section 1232 and this paragraph apply and, since the substance of the deposit arrangement is identical to that contained in example (1), A must include the same amount in gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the certificate provides for the payment of interest in the amount of $200 on December 31, of each year and $2,000 plus $10,000 (the original amount) payable upon redemption at December 31, 1975. Thus, if A holds the certificate of deposit for the full calendar year 1971, A must include in his gross income for 1971 the $200 interest payable on December 31, 1971, and $400 of original issue discount, that is, \12/60\ months multiplied by the excess of the stated redemption price ($12,000) over the issue price ($10,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. B is a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On January 1, 1971, B purchases a 4-year savings certificate from the Y Building and Loan Corporation for $4,000, redeemable on December 31, 1974, for $5,000. On December 31, 1973, Y redeems the certificate for $4,660. Under section 1232(a)(3), B included $250 of original issue discount in his gross income for 1971, $250 for 1972, and includes $250 in his gross income for 1973 for a total of $750. Since the excess of (i) the amount received upon the redemption, $4,660, over (ii) the issue price, $4,000, or $660, is lower than the total amount of original issue discount ($750)

included in B's gross income for the period he held the certificate by $90, the $90 will be treated under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as a deduction in computing adjusted gross income, and accordingly, will decrease the basis of his certificate by such amount. B has no gain or loss upon the redemption, as determined in accordance with the following computation:

On January 1, 1971, C, a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, opens a savings account in Z bank with a $10,000 deposit. Under the terms of the account, interest is made available semiannually at 6 percent annual interest, compounded semiannually. Since all of the interest on C's account in Z Bank is made available semiannually, the stated redemption price at maturity under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3 equals the issue price, and, therefore, no original issue discount is reportable by C under section 1232(a)(3). However, C must include the sum of $300 (i.e., \1/2\ x 6% x $10,000) plus $309 (i.e., \1/2\ x 6% x $10,300) or $609, of interest made available during 1971 in his gross income for 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D is a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On January 1, 1971, D purchases a $10,000 deferred income certificate from M Bank. Under the terms of the certificate, interest accrues at 6 percent per annum, compounded quarterly. The period of the account is 10 years. In addition, the holder is permitted to withdraw the entire amount of the purchase price at any time (but not interest prior to the expiration of the 10 year term), and upon such a withdrawal of the purchase price, no further interest accrues. If the certificate is held to maturity, the issue price plus accrued interest will aggregate $18,140.18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In respect of the certificate, the original issue discount is $8,140.18, determined by subtracting the issue price of the certificate ($10,000) from the stated redemption price at maturity ($18,140.18). Thus, under section 1232(a)(3) the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount is $67.835 (i.e., \1/20\ months, multiplied by $8,140.18). Under section 1232(a)(3), D includes $814.02 (i.e., 12 months, multiplied by $67.835) in his gross income for each calendar year the certificate remains outstanding and under section 1232(a)(3)(E) increases his basis by that amount. Thus, on December 31, 1975, D's basis for the certificate is $14,070.10 (i.e., issue price, $10,000, increased by product of $814.02x5 years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1975, D withdraws the $10,000. Under the terms of the certificate $3,468.55 cannot be withdrawn until December 31, 1980. Under the provisions of subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, the $10,000 partial redemption shall be treated as follows:

In addition, D will decrease his basis in the unredeemed portion by $601.55, the amount of such adjustment, from $4,070.10 to $3,468.55.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. E is a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On January 1, 1971, E purchases a $10,000 ``Bonus Savings Certificate'' from N Building and Loan Corporation. Under the terms of the certificate, interest is payable at 5 percent per annum, compounded quarterly, and the period of the account is 3 years. In addition, the certificate provides that if the holder makes no withdrawals of principal or interest during the term of the certificate, a bonus payment equal to 5 percent of the purchase price of the certificate will be paid to the holder of the certificate at maturity. Thus, the amount of the bonus payment is $500 (i.e., 5 percent multiplied by $10,000). Since the 5 percent annual interest is payable quarterly, the amount of such interest is not included in determining the stated redemption price at maturity under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.1232-3. However, since the bonus payment is only payable at maturity, the amount of such bonus is included as part of the stated redemption price at maturity. Thus, the stated redemption price at maturity equals $10,500 (purchase price, $10,000, plus bonus payment $500). Accordingly, the original issue discount attributable to such certificate equals $500 (stated redemption price at maturity. $10,500, minus issue price, $10,000). Therefore, E must include as interest $166.67 (i.e., \12/36\ months, multiplied by the original issue discount, $500) in his gross income for each taxable year he holds the certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Renewable certificates of deposit--(i) In general. The renewal of a certificate of deposit shall be treated as a purchase of the certificate on the date the renewal period begins regardless of any requirement pursuant to the terms of the certificate that the holder give notice of an intention to renew or not to renew. Thus, for example, in the case of a certificate of deposit for which a renewal period begins after December 31, 1970, such renewal shall be treated as a purchase after such date whether or not the initial period began before such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The renewal of a certificate of deposit shall be treated as a purchase of the certificate on the date the renewal period begins regardless of any requirement pursuant to the terms of the certificate that the holder give notice of an intention to renew or not to renew. Thus, for example, in the case of a certificate of deposit for which a renewal period begins after December 31, 1970, such renewal shall be treated as a purchase after such date whether or not the initial period began before such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation. For purposes of computing the amount of original issue discount to be ratably included as interest in gross income under section 1232(a)(3) in respect of a renewable certificate of deposit for the initial period or any renewal period, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The issue price on the date any renewal period begins is considered to be in the case of a certificate of deposit initially purchased:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After December 31, 1970, the adjusted basis of the certificate on the date such period begins,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Before January 1, 1971, the amount the adjusted basis would have been on the date such period begins had the holder included all amounts of original issue discount as interest in gross income that would have been includible if section 1232(a)(3) had applied to the certificate from the date of original purchase.
Thus, if under the terms of the certificate, no amount is forfeited upon a failure to renew, then the issue price on the date any renewal period begins is considered to be the amount which would have been received by the holder on such date had it not been renewed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The date of original issue for any renewal period shall be considered to be the date it begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date of maturity for the initial period or any renewal period shall be considered to be the date it ends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The stated redemption price at maturity for the initial period or any renewal period shall be considered to be the maximum amount which would be received at the end of any such period, without regard to any reduction resulting from withdrawal prior to maturity or failure to renew at any renewal date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of 1-year rule. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section (relating to nonapplication of section 1232(a)(3) to any obligation having a term of 1 year or less), the period between the date of original issue (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.1232-3) of a renewable certificate of deposit and its stated maturity date shall include all renewal periods with respect to which, under the terms of the certificate, the holder may either take action or refrain from taking action which would prevent the actual or constructive receipt of any interest on such certificate until the expiration of any such renewal period whether or not the original date of issue is prior to January 1, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: (a) On May 1, 1969, A purchases a 2-year renewable certificate of deposit from M bank, a corporation, for $10,000. Interest will be compounded semiannually at 6 percent on May 1 and November 1. The terms of the certificate provide that such certificate will be automatically renewed on the anniversary date every 2 years if the holder does not notify M of an intention not to renew prior to 60 days before the particular anniversary date. Thus, on May 1, 1971, and May 1, 1973, the certificate may be redeemed for $11,255.09 and $12,667.60, respectively. However, in no event shall the initial period and the renewal periods exceed 10 years. A does not notify M of an intention not to renew by March 1, 1971, and the certificate is automatically renewed for an additional 2-year period on May 1, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the May 1, 1971, renewal shall be treated as the purchase of a certificate of deposit on that date, i.e., after December 31, 1970. Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the issue price is considered to be $11,255.09 and the date of maturity is considered to be May 1, 1973. Since the stated redemption price at maturity is $12,667.60. A must include $58.85 as interest in gross income for each month he holds the certificate during the renewal period beginning May 1, 1971, computed as follows:

On December 1, 1970, F enters into a 5-year deposit open account arrangement with M Savings and Loan Corp. The terms of the arrangement provide that F will deposit $100 each month for a period of 5 years, and that interest will be compounded semiannually (on June 1 and December 1) at 6 percent, but will be paid only at maturity. Thus, assuming F makes deposits of $100 on the first of each month beginning with December 1, 1970, the account will have a stated redemption price of $6,998.20 at maturity on December 1, 1975. Since, however, section 1232 applies only to deposits made after December 31, 1970 (see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1232-1), the $34.39 of compound interest to be earned on the first deposit of $100 over the term of the arrangement will not be subject to the ratable inclusion rules of section 1232(a)(3).

If under the terms of a deposit arrangement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The holder cannot receive payment of any interest or constructively receive any interest prior to a fixed maturity date,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest is earned at a guaranteed minimum rate of compound interest,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Additional contingent interest may be earned for any year at a rate not to exceed one percentage point above such guaranteed minimum rate, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any additional contingent interest is credited at least annually to the depositor's account,
Then any contingent interest credited to the depositor shall be treated as creating a separate obligation subject to the rules of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation. For purposes of computing the original issue discount to be included as interest in the depositor's gross income under section 1232(a)(3) with respect to such separate obligation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The issue price shall be zero,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The date of original issue shall be the date on which the contingent interest is credited to the depositor's account and begins to earn interest,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date of maturity shall be the fixed maturity date of the deposit, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of the amount of such contingent interest plus any interest to be earned thereon at the guaranteed minimum rate of compound interest between such dates of original issue and maturity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Contingent interest arrangements other than those described in subparagraph (6)--(i) In general. If under the

terms of a deposit arrangement, contingent interest may be earned and credited to a depositor's account, but is neither actually or constructively received before a fixed maturity date nor treated under subparagraph (6)(i) of this paragraph as creating a separate obligation, then the redemption price shall include the amount which would be credited to such account assuming the issuer, during the term of such account, credits contingent interest at the greater of the rate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Last credited on a similar account, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Equal to the average rate credited for the preceding 5 calendar years on a similar account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments for additional interest. The rate taken into account under this subparagraph in computing the redemption price shall be treated as the guaranteed minimum rate for purposes of applying subparagraph (6) of this paragraph in the event the rate at which contingent interest is actually credited to the depositor's account exceeds such rate previously taken into account. If for any period the actual rate at which contingent interest is credited to the account exceeds by more than 1 percentage point the rate for the previous period taken into account under this subparagraph in computing the redemption price, a new computation shall be made to determine the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount to be included as interest in the gross income of the depositor over the remaining term of the account. For purposes of such computation, the date that interest is first so credited to the account shall be treated as the issue date, the adjusted basis of the account on such date shall be the issue price, and the redemption price shall equal the amount actually on deposit in the account on such date plus the amount which would be credited to such account assuming the issuer, during the remaining term of such account, continues to credit contingent interest at the new rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustment for reduced interest. If for any period the actual rate of interest at which contingent interest is credited to the depositor's account is less than the rate for the previous period taken into account under this subparagraph in computing the redemption price, the difference between the amount of interest which would have been credited to the account at the rate for such previous period and the amount actually credited shall be allowed as a deduction against the amount of original issue discount with respect to such account required to be included in the gross income of the depositor. If an account is redeemed for a price less than the adjusted basis of the account, the depositor shall be allowed as a deduction, in computing adjusted gross income, the amount of the original issue discount he included in gross income but did not receive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Application of section 1232(a)(3) to face-amount certificates--(1) In general. Under paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1232-1, the provisions of section 1232(a)(3) and this section apply in the case of a face-amount certificate issued after December 31, 1975 (other than such a certificate issued pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on such date and at all times thereafter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1232-1, the provisions of section 1232(a)(3) and this section apply in the case of a face-amount certificate issued after December 31, 1975 (other than such a certificate issued pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on such date and at all times thereafter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relationship with paragraph (e) of this section. Determinations with regard to the inclusion as interest of original issue discount on, and certain adjustments with respect to, face-amount certificates to which this section applies shall be made in a manner consistent with the rules of paragraph (e) of this section (relating to the application of section 1232 to certain deposits in financial institutions and similar arrangements). Thus, for example, if a face-amount certificate is redeemed before maturity, the holder shall be allowed a deduction in computing adjusted gross income computed in a manner consistent with the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. For a further example, if under the terms of a face-amount certificate, the issuer may grant additional credits to be paid at a fixed maturity date, computations with respect to such additional credits shall be made in a manner consistent with the rules of paragraphs (e) (6) and

(7) of this section (as applicable) relating to contingent interest arrangements.
