                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On transfer or retirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided by  this part, the enrollment of an employee or annuitant eligible to  continue enrollment continues without change when he or she moves from  one employing office to another, without a break in service of more than  3 days, whether the personnel action is designated as a transfer or not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order for an employee to continue an enrollment as an  annuitant, he or she must meet the participation requirements set forth  at 8905(b) of title 5, United States Code, for continuing an enrollment  as an annuitant as of the commencing date of his or her annuity or  monthly compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of this part, an employee is considered to have  enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee enrolled during  the first of the periods set forth in Sec. 890.301 in which he or she  was eligible to enroll or was covered at that time by the enrollment of  another employee or annuitant, or whose enrollment was effective not  later than December 31, 1964.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Enrollment or eligibility for enrollment under subparts H or K  of this part of an individual who is not an employee eligible for  coverage under other provisions of this part is not considered in  determining whether a retiring employee has met the participation  requirements of Sec. 8905(b) of title 5, U.S. Code. Coverage under  subparts H or K of this part of an individual who is an employee  eligible for coverage under other provisions of this part may be  considered in determining whether a retiring employee has met the  participation requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of enrolled employees to certain excluded positions.  Employees and annuitants enrolled under this part who move, without a  break in service or after a separation of 3 days or less, to an  employment in which they are excluded by Sec. 890.102(c), continue to  be enrolled unless excluded by paragraphs (c)(4), (5), (6), (7), or (9)  of Sec. 890.102.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On death. The enrollment of a deceased employee or annuitant who  is enrolled for self and family (as opposed to self only) is transferred  automatically to his or her eligible survivor annuitants. The enrollment  is considered to be that of (1) the survivor annuitant from whose  annuity all or the greatest portion of the withholding for health  benefits is made or (2) the surviving spouse entitled to a basic  employee death benefit. The enrollment covers members of the family of  the deceased employee or annuitant. In those instances in which the  annuity is split among surviving family members, multiple enrollments  are allowed. A remarried spouse is not a member of the family of the  deceased employee or annuitant unless annuity under section 8341   or 8442 of title 5, United States Code, continues after remarriage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Survivor annuitants. If an employee who is entitled to health  benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to enroll or to  continue to be enrolled under his eligibility as an employee, and is  thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment based  on his own service, he is entitled to reinstatement of his employee- acquired enrollment on application to his retirement office.  Reinstatement is effective immediately after termination of his  employee-acquired enrollment if the application is received by the  retirement office within 60 days of separation; otherwise reinstatement  is effective on the first day of the first pay period after receipt of  the application. The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity  that the former employee receives as a survivor annuitant, the amounts  necessary to pay his share of the cost of the enrollment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employee becomes a survivor annuitant. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an employee who is  entitled to health benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to  enroll or to continue to be enrolled under his or her eligibility as an  employee, and is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued  enrollment based on his or her own service, the employee is entitled to  reinstatement of the enrollment as a survivor annuitant on application  to the retirement office. Reinstatement as a survivor annuitant is  effective on the day after the termination date of the employee-acquired  enrollment if the application is received by the retirement office  within 60 days of separation; otherwise, reinstatement is effective on  the first day of the first pay period after receipt of the application.  The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity that the former  employee receives as a survivor annuitant the amounts necessary to pay  the health benefits premium.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the surviving spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is  enrolled as an employee with a self and family enrollment (or, if both  the decedent and the surviving spouse were enrolled in a self only  enrollment) at the time the surviving spouse becomes a survivor  annuitant and the surviving spouse is thereafter separated without  entitlement to continued enrollment as a retiree, the surviving spouse  is entitled to enroll as a survivor annuitant. The change from coverage  as an employee to coverage as a survivor annuitant must be made with 30  days of separation from service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except for an employee who meets the definition of former  spouse under 5 U.S.C. 8901(10) based on an individual's deferred annuity  under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h) or 8445(f), the employee survivor of an annuitant  receiving deferred retirement benefits is not eligible for FEHB Program  enrollment as a survivor annuitant and therefore may not enroll as a  survivor annuitant based on coverage obtained as an employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insurance interest survivor annuity. A current spouse who is an  insurable interest beneficiary under Sec. 831.606(b) or Sec.  842.605(b) of this title is eligible to continue health benefits  enrollment as an insurable interest survivor annuitant so long as he or  she was covered as a family member at the time of the annuitant's death.  This entitlement applies even if the spouse is eligible for continued  enrollment as a survivor annuitant under another section of 5 CFR parts  831 or 843. To prevent dual coverage, the spouse must be covered under  only one health benefits enrollment under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In nonpay status. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided by law, the  enrollment of an employee continues while he/she is in nonpay status for  up to 365 days. The 365 days' nonpay status may be continuous or broken  by periods of less than 4 consecutive months in pay status. If an  employee has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period  of nonpay status he/she is entitled to begin the 365 days' continuation  of enrollment anew. For the purposes of this paragraph, 4 consecutive  months in pay status means any 4-month period during which the employee  is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, in the case of an employee who is employed under an OPM  approved career-related work-study program under Schedule D of at least  one year's duration and who is expected to be in a pay status during not   less than one-third of the total period of time from the date of the  first appointment to the completion of the work-study program, his/her  enrollment continues while he/she is in nonpay status so long as he/she  is participating in the work-study program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Temporary continuation of coverage. Certain former employees who  lose coverage because of a separation from Federal service, certain  children who lose coverage because they cease to meet the requirements  for coverage as children, and certain former spouses who lose coverage  because their marriage to the enrollee ends and who are not eligible for  coverage under subpart H of this part may elect temporary continuation  of coverage under the provisions of subpart K of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Service in the uniformed services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The enrollment of an  individual who separates, enters military furlough, or is placed in  nonpay status to serve in the uniformed services under conditions that  entitle him or her to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or  similar authority, may continue for the 24-month period beginning on the  date that the employee is placed on leave without pay or separated from  service to perform active duty in the uniformed services, provided that  the individual continues to be entitled to benefits under part 353 of  this chapter, or similar authority. As provided for by 5 U.S.C. 8905(a),  the continuation of enrollment for up to 24 months applies to employees  called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation  on or after September 14, 2001. The enrollment of an employee who met  the requirements of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, on or  after December 10, 2004, may continue for the 24-month period beginning  on the date that the employee is placed on leave without pay or  separated from service to perform active duty in the uniformed services,  provided that the employee continues to be entitled to continued  coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee in nonpay status is entitled to continued coverage  under paragraph (e) of this section if the employee's entitlement to  benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority, ends  before the expiration of 365 days in nonpay status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the enrollment of an employee had terminated due to the  expiration of 365 days in nonpay status or because of the employee's  separation from service, it may be reinstated for the remainder of the  24-month period beginning on the date that the employee is placed on  leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty in  the uniformed services, provided that the employee continues to be  entitled to continued coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or  similar authority.
