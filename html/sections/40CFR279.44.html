                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To ensure that used oil is not a hazardous waste under the  rebuttable   presumption of Sec.  279.10(b)(1)(ii), the used oil transporter must  determine whether the total halogen content of used oil being  transported or stored at a transfer facility is above or below 1,000  ppm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transporter must make this determination by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testing the used oil; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in  light of the materials or processes used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm  total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has  been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part  261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by  demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for  example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant  concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix  VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/ fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through  a tolling arrangement as described in Sec.  279.24(c), to reclaim  metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking  oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or  disposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils  contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration  units if the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable  presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have  been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record retention. Records of analyses conducted or information  used to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be  maintained by the transporter for at least 3 years.
