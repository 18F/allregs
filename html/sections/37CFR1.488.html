In case of any doubt as to which invention is the main invention, the invention first mentioned in the claims and previously searched by an International

Searching Authority shall be considered the main invention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lack of unity of invention may be directly evident before considering the claims in relation to any prior art, or after taking the prior art into consideration, as where a document discovered during the search shows the invention claimed in a generic or linking claim lacks novelty or is clearly obvious, leaving two or more claims joined thereby without a common inventive concept. In such a case the International Preliminary Examining Authority may raise the objection of lack of unity of invention.
