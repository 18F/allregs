                                Sec. 25.2513-1  Gifts by husband or wife to third party considered as
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A gift made by one spouse to a person other than his (or her) spouse may, for the purpose of the gift tax, be considered as made one-half by his spouse, but only if at the time of the gift each spouse was a citizen or resident of the United States. For purposes of this section, an individual is to be considered as the spouse of another individual only if he was married to such individual at the time of the gift and does not remarry during the remainder of the ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this section will apply to gifts made during a particular ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)) only if both spouses signify their consent to treat all gifts made to third parties during that calendar period by both spouses while married to each other as having been made one-half by each spouse. As to the manner and time for signifying consent, see Sec. 25.2513-2. Such consent, if signified with respect to any calendar period, is effective with respect to all gifts made to third parties during such calendar period except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the consenting spouses were not married to each other during a portion of the calendar period, the consent is not effective with respect to any gifts

made during such portion of the calendar period. Where the consent is signified by an executor or administrator of a deceased spouse, the consent is not effective with respect to gifts made by the surviving spouse during the portion of the calendar period that his spouse was deceased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If either spouse was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States during any portion of the calendar period, the consent is not effective with respect to any gift made during that portion of the calendar period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The consent is not effective with respect to a gift by one spouse of a property interest over which he created in his spouse a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2514(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If one spouse transferred property in part to his spouse and in part to third parties, the consent is effective with respect to the interest transferred to third parties only insofar as such interest is ascertainable at the time of the gift and hence severable from the interest transferred to his spouse. See Sec. 25.2512-5 for the principles to be applied in the valuation of annuities, life estates, terms for years, remainders and reversions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The consent applies alike to gifts made by one spouse alone and to gifts made partly by each spouse, provided such gifts were to third parties and do not fall within any of the exceptions set forth in subparagraphs (1) through (4) of this paragraph. The consent may not be applied only to a portion of the property interest constituting such gifts. For example, a wife may not treat gifts made by her spouse from his separate property to third parties as having been made one-half by her if her spouse does not consent to treat gifts made by her to third parties during the same calendar period as having been made one-half by him. If the consent is effectively signified on either the husband's return or the wife's return, all gifts made by the spouses to third parties (except as described in subparagraphs (1) through (4) of this paragraph), during the calendar period will be treated as having been made one-half by each spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a husband and wife consent to have the gifts made to third party donees considered as made one-half by each spouse, and only one spouse makes gifts during the ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the other spouse is not required to file a gift tax return provided: (1) The total value of the gifts made to each third party donee since the beginning of the calendar year is not in excess of $20,000 ($6,000 for calendar years prior to 1982), and (2) no portion of the property transferred constitutes a gift of a future interest. If a transfer made by either spouse during the calendar period to a third-party represents a gift of a future interest in property and the spouses consent to have the gifts considered as made one-half by each, a gift tax return for such calendar period must be filed by each spouse regardless of the value of the transfer. (See Sec. 25.2503-3 for the definition of a future interest.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of this section relating to the requirements for the filing of a return, assuming that a consent was effectively signified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A husband made gifts valued at $7,000 during the second quarter of 1971 to a third party and his wife made no gifts during this time. Each spouse is required to file a return for the second calendar quarter of 1971.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A husband made gifts valued at $5,000 to each of two third parties during the year 1970 and his wife made no gifts. Only the husband is required to file a return. (See Sec. 25.6019-2.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the third quarter of 1971, a husband made gifts valued at $5,000 to a third party, and his wife made gifts valued at $2,000 to the same third party. Each spouse is required to file a return for the third calendar quarter of 1971.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A husband made gifts valued at $5,000 to a third party and his wife made gifts valued at $3,000 to another third party during the year 1970. Only the husband is required to file a return for the calendar year 1970. (See Sec. 25.6019-2.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A husband made gifts valued at $2,000 during the first quarter of 1971 to third parties which represented gifts of future interests in property (see Sec. 25.2503-3), and his wife made no gifts during such calendar quarter. Each

spouse is required to file a return for the first calendar quarter of 1971.
