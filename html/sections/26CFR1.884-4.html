Foreign  corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer that is not a corporation  described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section (relating to banks),  has $120 of interest allocated or apportioned to ECI under Sec. 1.882-5  for 1997. A's branch interest (as defined in paragraph (b) of this  section) for 1997 is as follows: $55 of portfolio interest (as defined  in section 871(h)(2)) to B, a nonresident alien; $25 of interest to  foreign corporation C, which owns 15 percent of the combined voting  power of A's stock, with respect to bonds issued by A; and $20 to D, a  domestic corporation. B and C are not engaged in the conduct of a trade  or business in the United States. A, B and C are residents of countries  with which the United States does not have an income tax treaty. The  interest payments made to B and D are not subject to tax under section  871(a) or 881 and are not subject to withholding under section 1441 or  1442. The payment to C, which does not qualify as portfolio interest  because C owns at least 10 percent of the combined voting power of A's  stock, is subject to withholding of $7.50 ($25x30%). In addition,  because A's interest allocated or apportioned to ECI under Sec. 1.882-5  ($120) exceeds its branch interest ($100), A has excess interest of $20,  which is subject to a tax of $6 ($20x30%) under section 881. The tax on  A's excess interest must be reported on A's income tax return for 1997.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxation of excess interest of a bank. Foreign  corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer, is a corporation described in  paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section (relating to banks) and is a  resident of a country with which the United States does not have an  income tax treaty. A has excess interest of $100 for 1997. At the close  of 1997, A has $10,000 of interest-bearing liabilities (including  liabilities that give rise to branch interest), of which $8,700 are  interest-bearing deposits.   For purposes of computing the tax on A's excess interest, $87 of the  excess interest ($100 excess interest x ($8,700 interest-bearing  deposits/$10,000 interest-bearing liabilities)) is treated as interest  on deposits. Thus, $87 of A's excess interest is exempt from tax under  section 881(a) and the remaining $13 of excess interest is subject to a  tax of $3.90 ($13 x 30%) under section 881(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Branch interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of branch interest.

A liability described in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section is identified as a liability of a U.S. trade  or business only if the liability is shown on the records of the U.S.  trade or business, or is identified as a liability of the U.S. trade or  business on other records of the foreign corporation or on a schedule  established for the purpose of identifying the liabilities of the U.S.  trade or business. Each such liability must be identified with  sufficient specificity so that the amount of branch interest  attributable to the liability, and the name and address of the  recipient, can be readily identified from such records or schedule.  However, with respect to liabilities that give rise to portfolio  interest (as defined in sections 871(h) and 881(c)) or that are payable  183 days or less from the date of original issue, and form part of a  larger debt issue, such liabilities may be identified by reference to  the issue and maturity date, principal amount and interest payable with  respect to the entire debt issue. Records or schedules described in this  paragraph that identify liabilities that give rise to branch interest  must be maintained in the United States by the foreign corporation or an  agent of the foreign corporation for the entire period commencing with  the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return for the  taxable year to which the records or schedules relate and ending with  the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of tax for  such taxable year. A foreign corporation that is subject to this section  may identify a liability under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section  whether or not it is actually engaged in the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section shall not be treated  as branch interest unless the foreign corporation paying the interest  either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Makes a return, pursuant to section 6049, with respect to the  interest payment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sends a notice to the person who receives such interest in a  confirmation of the transaction, a statement of account, or a separate  notice, within two months of the end of the calendar year in which the  interest was paid,   stating that the interest paid with respect to the liability is from  sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> (and interest with respect to the liability may  not be treated as branch interest of a foreign corporation by reason of  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The liability is directly incurred in the ordinary course of the  profit-making activities of a trade or business of the foreign  corporation conducted outside the United States, as, for example, an  account or note payable arising from the purchase of inventory or  receipt of services by such trade or business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The liability is secured (during more than half the days during  the portion of the taxable year in which the interest accrues)  predominantly by property that is not a U.S. asset (as defined in Sec.  1.884-1(d)) unless such liability is secured by substantially all the  property of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> and that is  not paid with respect to a liability described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)  of this section (relating to liabilities incurred in the ordinary course  of a foreign business or secured by non-U.S. assets) shall be treated as  branch interest.

The application of this paragraph (b)(5) is  illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Application of 80 percent test. Foreign corporation A, a  calendar year taxpayer, has $90 of interest allocated or apportioned to  ECI under Sec. 1.882-5 for 1993. Before application of this paragraph  (b)(5), A has $40 of branch interest in 1993. A pays $60 of other  interest during 1993, none of which is attributable to a liability  described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of a foreign business and  liabilities predominantly secured by foreign assets). As of the close of  1993, A has an amount of U.S. assets that exceeds 80 percent of the  money and E&P; bases of all A's property. Before application of this  paragraph (b)(5), A would have $50 of excess interest (i.e., the $90  interest allocated or apportioned to its ECI under Sec. 1.882-5 less  $40 of branch interest). Under this paragraph (b)(5), the $60 of  additional interest paid by A is also treated as branch interest.  However, to the extent that treating the $60 of additional interest as  branch interest would create an amount of branch interest that would  exceed the amount of branch interest permitted under paragraph (b)(6) of  this section (relating to branch interest that exceeds a foreign  corporation's interest allocated or apportioned to ECI under Sec.  1.882-5) the amount of the additional branch interest is reduced under  paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, which generally allows a foreign  corporation to specify certain liabilities that do not give rise to  branch interest or paragraph (b) (6) (ii) of this section, which  generally specifies liabilities that do not give rise to branch interest  beginning with the most-recently incurred liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule where branch interest exceeds interest allocated or  apportioned to ECI of a foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If the  amount of branch interest that is both paid and accrued by a foreign  corporation during the taxable year (including interest that the foreign  corporation elects under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to treat as  paid during the taxable year) exceeds the amount of interest allocated  or apportioned to ECI of a foreign corporation under Sec. 1.882-5 for  the taxable year,   then the amount of the foreign corporation's branch interest shall be  reduced by the amount of such excess as provided in paragraphs  (b)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable. The rules of  paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section shall also apply where  the amount of branch interest with respect to liabilities identified  under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds the maximum amount  that may be treated as branch interest under that paragraph. This  paragraph (b)(6) shall apply whether or not a reduction in the amount of  branch interest occurs as a result of adjustments made during the  examination of the foreign corporation's income tax return, such as a  reduction in the amount of interest allocated or apportioned to ECI of  the foreign corporation under Sec. 1.882-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> shall  not be treated as paid by a domestic corporation and thus shall not be  subject to tax under section 871(a) or 881(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> shall not be treated as  paid by a domestic corporation and thus shall not be subject to tax  under section 871 (a) or 881 (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (b)(6) is  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Branch interest exceeds interest apportioned to ECI with  no election in effect. Foreign corporation A, a calendar year, accrual  method taxpayer, has interest expense apportioned to ECI under Sec.  1.882-5 of $230 for 1997. A's branch interest for 1997 is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $130 paid to B, a domestic corporation, with respect to a note  issued on March 10, 1997, and secured by real property located in the  United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $60 paid to C, an individual resident of country X who is  entitled to a 10 percent rate of withholding on interest payments under  the income tax treaty between the United States and X, with respect to a  note issued on October 15, 1996, which gives rise to interest subject to  tax under section 871(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> $80 paid to D, an individual resident of country Y who is  entitled to a 15 percent rate of withholding on interest payments under  the income tax treaty between the United States and Y, with respect to a  note issued on February 15, 1997, which gives rise to interest subject  to tax under section 871(a); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this example. A has not  made an election under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section to specify  liabilities that do not give rise to branch interest. The amount of A's  branch interest in 1997 is limited under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this  section to $230, the amount of the interest apportioned to A's ECI for  1997. The amount of A's branch interest must thus be reduced by $110  ($340-$230) under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The reduction is  first made with respect to interest attributable to liabilities  described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (i.e., liabilities  identified as giving rise to branch interest) and, within the group of  liabilities described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, is first  made with respect to the latest-incurred liability. Thus, the $70 of  interest paid to E with respect to the bond issued on March 1, 1997, and  $40 of the $80 of interest paid to D with respect to the note issued on  February 15, 1997, are not treated as branch interest. The interest paid  to D is no longer subject to tax under section 871(a), and D may claim a  refund of amounts withheld with respect to the interest payments. There  is no change in the tax consequences to E because the interest received  by E was portfolio interest and was not subject to tax when it was  treated as branch interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Effect of election to specify liabilities. Assume the  same facts as in Example 1 except that A makes an election under  paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section to specify which liabilities are  not to be treated as giving rise to branch interest. A specifies the  liability to D, who would be taxable at a rate of 15 percent on interest  paid with respect to the liability, as a liability that does not give  rise to branch interest, and D is therefore not subject to tax under  section 871 (a) and is entitled to a refund of amounts withheld with  respect to the interest payments. A also specifies the liability to C as  a liability that gives rise to branch interest only in part. As a  result, $30 of the $60 of interest paid to C is not treated as branch  interest, and C is entitled to a refund with respect to the $30 of  interest that is not treated as branch interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Effect of election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to  treat interest as if paid in year of accrual. If a foreign corporation  accrues an interest expense in a taxable year earlier than the taxable  year of payment and elects under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to  compute its excess interest as if the interest expense were branch  interest paid in the year of accrual, the interest expense shall be  treated as branch interest that is paid at the close of such year (and  not in the actual year of payment) for all purposes of this section.  Such interest shall thus be subject to tax under section 871(a) or  881(a) and withholding under section 1441 or section 1442, as if paid on  the last day of the taxable year of accrual. Interest that is treated  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section as paid in a later year for  purposes of   computing excess interest shall be treated as paid only in the actual  year of payment for all purposes of this section other than paragraphs  (a)(2) and (c)(1) of this section (relating to excess interest).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Effect of treaties--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payor's treaty. In the case of a foreign  corporation's branch interest, relief shall be available under an  article of an income tax treaty between the United States and the  foreign corporation's country of residence relating to interest paid by  the foreign corporation only if, for the taxable year in which the  branch interest is paid (or if the branch interest is treated as paid in  an earlier taxable year under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, for the  earlier taxable year)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The foreign corporation meets the requirements of the limitation  on benefits provision, if any, in the treaty, and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The corporation is a qualified resident (as defined in Sec.  1.884-5(a)) of that foreign country in such year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The corporation meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(8)(iii)  of this section in such year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The limitation on benefits provision, or an amendment to that  provision, entered into force after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recipient's treaty. A foreign person (other than a foreign  corporation) that derives branch interest is entitled to claim benefits  under provisions of an income tax treaty between the United States and  its country of residence relating to interest derived by the foreign  person. A foreign corporation may claim such benefits if it meets, with  respect to the branch interest, the requirements of the limitation on  benefits provision, if any, in the treaty and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> or (B) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of interest paid in a taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1988, with respect to an obligation with a maturity not  exceeding one year, each foreign corporation that beneficially owned the  obligation prior to maturity was a qualified resident (for the period  specified in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section) of a foreign country  with which the United States has an income tax treaty or met the  requirements of the limitation on benefits provision in a treaty with  respect to the interest payment and such provision entered into force  after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Presumption that a foreign corporation continues to be a  qualified resident. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(8), a foreign  corporation that was a qualified resident for the prior taxable year  because it fulfills the requirements of Sec. 1.884-5 shall be  considered a qualified resident with respect to branch interest that is  paid or received during the current taxable year if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a foreign corporation that met the stock  ownership and base erosion tests in Sec. 1.884-5(b) and (c) for the  preceding taxable year, the foreign corporation does not know, or have  reason to know, that either 50 percent of its stock (by value) is not  beneficially owned (or treated as beneficially owned by reason of Sec.  1.884-5(b)(2)) by qualifying shareholders at any time during the portion  of the taxable year that ends with the date on which the interest is  paid, or that the base erosion test is not met during the portion of the  taxable year that ends with the date on which the interest is paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a foreign corporation that met the requirements  of Sec. 1.884-5(d) (relating to publicly-traded corporations) for the  preceding taxable year, the foreign corporation is listed on an  established securities exchange in the United States or its country of  residence at all times during the portion of the taxable year that ends  with the date on which the interest is paid and does not fail the  requirements of Sec. 1.884-5(d)(4)(iii) (relating to certain closely- held corporations) at any time during such period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a foreign corporation that met the requirements  of Sec. 1.884-5(e) (relating to the active trade or business test) for  the preceding taxable year, the foreign corporation continues to operate  (other than in a nominal degree), at all times during the portion of the  taxable year that ends with the date on which the interest is paid, the  same business in the U.S. and its country of residence that   caused it to meet such requirements for the preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treaties other than income tax treaties. A treaty that is not  an income tax treaty does not provide any benefits with respect to  branch interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effect of income tax treaties on interest paid by a partnership.  If a foreign corporation is a partner (directly or indirectly) in a  partnership that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States  and owns an interest of 10 percent or more (as determined under the  attribution rules of section 318) in the capital, profits, or losses of  the partnership at any time during the partner's taxable year, the  relief that may be claimed under an income tax treaty with respect to  the foreign corporation distributive share of interest paid or treated  as paid by the partnership shall not exceed the relief that would be  available under paragraphs (b)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section if such  interest were branch interest of the foreign corporation. See paragraph  (c)(2) of this section for the effect on a foreign corporation's excess  interest of interest paid by a partnership of which the foreign  corporation is a partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Payor's treaty. The income tax treaty between the United  States and country X provides that the United States may not impose a  tax on interest paid by a corporation that is a resident of that country  (and that is not a domestic corporation) if the recipient of the  interest is a nonresident alien or a foreign corporation. Corp A is a  qualified resident of country X and meets the limitation on benefits  provision in the treaty. A's branch interest is not subject to tax under  section 871(a) or 881(a) regardless of whether the recipient is entitled  to benefits under an income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Recipient's treaty and interest received from a  partnership. A, a foreign corporation, and B, a nonresident alien, are  partners in a partnership that owns and operates U.S. real estate and  each has a distributive share of partnership interest deductions equal  to 50 percent of the interest deductions of the partnership. There is no  income tax treaty between the United States and the countries of  residence of A and B. The partnership pays $1,000 of interest to a bank  that is a resident of a foreign country, Y, and that qualifies under an  income tax treaty in effect with the United States for a 5 percent rate  of tax on U.S. source interest paid to a resident of country Y. However,  the bank is not a qualified resident of country Y and the limitation on  benefits provision of the treaty has not been amended since December 31,  1986. The partnership is required to withhold at a rate of 30 percent on  $500 of the interest paid to the bank (i.e., A's 50 percent distributive  share of interest paid by the partnership) because the bank cannot,  under paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, claim greater treaty  benefits by lending money to the partnership than it could claim, if it  lent money to A directly and the $500 were branch interest of A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> shall apply to all branch  interest that is paid or accrued during that year. See paragraph (b)(7)  of this section for the effect of an election under this paragraph  (c)(1) on branch interest that accrues in a taxable year after the year  of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election not to apply in certain cases. An election under this  paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to an interest expense that accrued in  a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, and shall not apply to  an interest expense that was paid in a taxable year beginning before  such date unless the interest was income from sources within the United  States. An election under this paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to  branch interest that accrues during the taxable year and is paid in an  earlier taxable year if the branch interest reduced excess interest in  such earlier year. However, a foreign corporation may amend its income  tax return for such earlier taxable year so that the   branch interest does not reduce excess interest in such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirements for election. A foreign corporation that elects  to apply this paragraph (c)(1) shall attach to its income tax return (or  to an amended income tax return) a statement that it elects to have the  provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) apply, or shall provide written  notice to the Commissioner during an examination that it elects to apply  this paragraph (c)(1). The election shall be effective for the taxable  year to which the return relates and for all subsequent taxable years  unless the Commissioner consents to revocation of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Interest accrued before paid. Foreign corporation A, a  calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, has $100 of interest allocated  or apportioned to ECI under Sec. 1.882-5 for 1997. A has $60 of branch  interest in 1997 before application of this paragraph (c)(1). A has an  interest expense of $20 that properly accrues for tax purposes in 1997  but is not paid until 1998. When the interest is paid in 1998 it will  meet the requirements for branch interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. A makes a timely election under this paragraph (c)(1) to treat  the accrued interest as if it were paid in 1997. A will be treated as  having branch interest of $80 for 1997 and excess interest of $20 in  1997. The $20 of interest treated as branch interest of A in 1997 will  not again be treated as branch interest in 1998.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Interest paid before accrued. Foreign corporation A, a  calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, has $60 of branch interest in  1997. The interest expense does not accrue until 1994 and the amount of  interest allocated or apportioned to A's ECI under Sec. 1.882-5 is zero  for 1997 and $60 for 1998. A makes an election under this paragraph  (c)(1) with respect to 1997. As a result of the election, A's $60 of  branch interest in 1997 reduces the amount of A's excess interest for  1994 rather than in 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (ii) of this section, if  a foreign corporation is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in  trade or business in the United States, the amount of the foreign  corporation's distributive share of interest paid or accrued by the  partnership shall reduce (but not below zero) the amount of the foreign  corporation's excess interest for the year to the extent such interest  is taken into account by the foreign corporation in that year for  purposes of calculating the interest allocated or apportioned to the ECI  of the foreign corporation under Sec. 1.882-5. A foreign corporation's  excess interest shall not be reduced by its distributive share of  partnership interest that is attributable to a liability described in  paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to interest on  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of a foreign business or  secured predominantly by assets that are not U.S. assets) or would be  described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section if entered on the  partner's books. See paragraph (b)(8)(v) of this section for the effect  of income tax treaties on interest paid by a partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for interest that is paid and accrued in different  years. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply to any  portion of a foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership  interest that is paid and accrued in different taxable years unless the  foreign corporation has an election in effect under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section that is effective with respect to such interest and any tax  due under section 871(a) or 881(a) with respect to such interest has  been deducted and withheld at source in the earlier of the taxable year  of payment or accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of treaties--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The rate of tax imposed on  the excess interest of a foreign corporation that is a resident of a  country with which the United States has an income tax treaty shall not  exceed the rate provided under such treaty that would apply with respect  to interest paid by a domestic corporation to that foreign corporation  if the foreign corporation meets, with respect to the excess interest,  the requirements of the limitation on benefits provision, if any, in the  treaty and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The corporation is a qualified resident (as defined in Sec.  1.884-5(a)) of that foreign country for the taxable year in which the  excess interest is subject to tax; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The limitation on benefits provision, or an amendment to that  provision, entered into force after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provisions relating to interest paid by a foreign corporation.  Any provision in an income tax treaty that exempts or reduces the rate  of tax on interest paid by a foreign corporation does not prevent  imposition of the tax on excess interest or reduce the rate of such tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The application of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this  section is illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Interest paid by a partnership. Foreign corporation A, a  calendar year taxpayer, is not a resident of a foreign country with  which the United States has an income tax treaty. A is engaged in the  conduct of a trade or business both in the United States and in foreign  countries, and owns a 50 percent interest in X, a calendar year  partnership engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States. For 1997, all of X's liabilities are of a type described in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section (relating to liabilities on U.S. books)  and none are described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section  (relating to liabilities that may not give rise to branch interest). A's  distributive share of interest paid by X in 1997 is $20. For 1997, A has  $150 of interest allocated or apportioned to its ECI under Sec. 1.882- 5, $120 of which is attributable to branch interest. Thus, the amount of  A's excess interest for 1997, before application of paragraph (c)(2)(i)  of this section, is $30. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, A's  $30 of excess interest is reduced by $20, representing A's share of  interest paid by X. Thus, the amount of A's excess interest for 1997 is  reduced to $10. A is subject to a tax of 30 percent on its $10 of excess  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Stapled entities. A foreign corporation that is treated as a  domestic corporation by reason of section 269B (relating to stapled  entities) shall continue to be treated as a foreign corporation for  purposes of section 884 (f) and this section, notwithstanding section  269B and the regulations thereunder. Interest paid by such foreign  corporation shall be treated as paid by a domestic corporation and shall  be subject to the tax imposed by section 871 (a) or 881 (a), and to  withholding under section 1441 and 1442, as applicable, to the extent  such interest is not subject to tax by reason of section 884(f) and this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section, this section is effective for taxable  years beginning October 13, 1992, and for payments of interest described  in section 884(f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> made (or treated as made under paragraph (b)(7)  of this section) during taxable years of the payor beginning after such  date. With respect to taxable years beginning before October 13, 1992,  and after December 31, 1986, a foreign corporation may elect to apply  this section in lieu of Sec. 1.884-4T of the temporary regulations (as  contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1992) as they  applied to the foreign corporation after issuance of Notice 89-80, 1989- 2 C.B. 394, but only if the foreign corporation has made an election  under Sec. 1.884-1 (i) to apply Sec. 1.884-1 in lieu of Sec. 1.884-1T  (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1992) for that  year, and the statute of limitations for assessment of a deficiency has  not expired for that taxable year. Once an election has been made, an  election under this section shall apply to all subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this  section are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 6,  1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Transition rules--(1) Election under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section. If a foreign corporation has made an election described in  Sec. 1.884-4T(b)(7) (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of  April 1, 1992) with respect to interest that has accrued and been paid  in different taxable years, such election shall be effective for  purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section as if the corporation had  made the election under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section of these  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Waiver of notification requirement for non-banks under Notice  89-80. If a foreign corporation that is not a bank has made an election  under Notice 89-80 to apply the rules in part 2 of section I of the  Notice in lieu of the rules in Sec. 1.884-4T(b) (as contained in the  CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1992) to determine the amount of its  interest paid and excess interest in taxable years beginning prior to  1990, the requirement that the foreign corporation satisfy the  notification requirements described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this  section is waived with respect to interest paid in taxable years ending  on or before the date the Notice was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver of legending requirement for certain debt issued prior to  January 3, 1989. For purposes of sections 871(h), 881(c), and this  section, branch interest of a foreign corporation that would be treated  as portfolio interest under section 871(h) or 881(c) but for the fact  that it fails to meet the requirements of section 163(f)(2)(B)(ii)(II)  (relating to the legend requirement), shall nevertheless be treated as  portfolio interest provided the interest arises with respect to a  liability incurred by the foreign corporation before January 3, 1989,  and interest with respect to the liability was treated as branch  interest in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1990.
