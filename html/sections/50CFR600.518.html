                                Sec. 600.518  Fee schedule for foreign fishing.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Permit application fees. Each vessel permit application  submitted under Sec. 600.501 must be accompanied by a fee. The amount of  the fee will be determined in accordance with the procedures for  determining administrative costs of each special product or service  contained in the NOAA Finance Handbook, which is available upon request  from the Office of International Affairs (see address at  Sec. 600.501(d)(1)). The fee is specified with the application form. At  the time the application is submitted, a check for the fees, drawn on a  U.S. bank, payable to the order of ``Department of Commerce, NOAA,''  must be sent to the Assistant Administrator. The permit fee payment must  be accompanied by a list of the vessels for which the payment is made.  In the case of applications for permits authorizing activity code 10,  the permit application fee will be waived if the applicant provides  satisfactory documentary proof to the Assistant Administrator that the  foreign nation under which the vessel is registered does not collect a  fee from a vessel of the United States engaged in similar activities in  the waters of such foreign nation. The documentation presented (e.g.,  copy of foreign fishing regulations applicable to vessels of the United  States) must clearly exempt vessels of the United States from such a  fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Poundage fees--(1) Rates. If a Nation chooses to accept an  allocation, poundage fees must be paid at the rate specified in the  following table.</p><p class="depth0">Table--Species and Poundage Fees</p><p class="depth0">[Dollars per metric ton] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Poundage</p><p class="depth0">Species                                fees ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Northwest Atlantic Ocean fisheries:</p><p class="depth0">1. Butterfish..............................................     277.96</p><p class="depth0">2. Herring, Atlantic.......................................      25.75</p><p class="depth0">3.

Squid, Loligo...........................................     321.68 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of payment of poundage fees and observer fees. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a  Nation chooses to accept an allocation, a revolving letter of credit (L/ C) must be established and maintained to cover the poundage fees for at  least 25 percent of the previous year's total allocation at the rate in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or as determined by the Assistant  Administrator, plus the observer fees required by paragraph (c) of this  section. The L/C must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Be with a bank subscribing to ICC Pub. 290.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Designate ``Department of Commerce, NOAA'' as beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Allow partial withdrawals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Be confirmed by a U.S. bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The customer must pay all commissions, transmission, and  service charges. No fishing will be allowed   until the L/C is established, and authorized written notice of its  issuance is provided to the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assessment of poundage fees. Poundage fees will be assessed  quarterly for the actual catch during January through March, April  through June, July through September, and October through December. The  appropriate Regional Administrator will reconcile catch figures with  each country following the procedures of Sec. 600.511(d). When the catch  figures are agreed upon, NOAA will present a bill for collection as the  documentary demand for payment to the confirming bank. If, after 45 days  from the end of the quarter, catches have not been reconciled, the  estimate of the Regional Administrator will stand and a bill will be  issued for that amount. If necessary, the catch figures may be refined  by the Regional Administrator during the next 60 days, and any  modifications will be reflected in the next quarter's bill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Observer fees. The Assistant Administrator will notify the  owners or operators of FFV's of the estimated annual costs of placing  observers aboard their vessels. The owners or operators of any such  vessel must provide for repayment of those costs by including one-fourth  of the estimated annual observer fee as determined by the Assistant  Administrator in a L/C as prescribed in Sec. 600.518(b)(2). During the  fiscal year, payment will be withdrawn from the L/C as required to cover  anticipated observer coverage for the upcoming fishery. The Assistant  Administrator will reconcile any differences between the estimated cost  and actual costs of observer coverage within 90 days after the end of  the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Financial assurances. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A foreign nation, or the owners and  operators of certain vessels of that foreign nation, may be required by  the Assistant Administrator to provide financial assurances. Such  assurances may be required if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Civil and criminal penalties assessed against fishing vessels of  the Nation have not effectively deterred violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels of that Nation have engaged in fishing in the EEZ  without proper authorization to conduct such activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Nation's vessel owners have refused to answer  administrative charges or summons to appear in court; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Enforcement of Magnuson-Stevens Act civil or criminal judgments  in the courts of a foreign nation is unattainable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The level of financial assurances will be guided by the level of  penalties assessed and costs to the U.S. Government.
