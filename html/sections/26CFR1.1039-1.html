                                Sec. 1.1039-1  Certain sales of low-income housing projects.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonrecognition of gain. Section 1039 provides rules under which the taxpayer may elect not to recognize gain in certain cases where a qualified housing project is sold or disposed of after October 9, 1969, in an approved disposition and another such qualified housing project or projects (referred to as the replacement project) is acquired, constructed, or reconstructed within a specified reinvestment period. If the requirements of section 1039 are met, and if the taxpayer makes an election in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, then the gain realized upon the sale or disposition is recognized only to the extent that the net amount realized on such sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the replacement project. However, notwithstanding section 1039, gain may be recognized by reason of the application of section 1245 or 1250 to the sale or disposition. (See Sec. 1.1245-6(b) and Sec. 1.1250-3(h). The terms qualified housing project, approved disposition, reinvestment period, and net amount realized are defined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules of application--(1) In general. The election under section 1039(a) may be made only by the taxpayer owning the qualified housing project disposed of. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a partnership, the partnership must make the election. (See section 703(b).) Similarly, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a corporation or trust, the corporation or trust must make the election. In addition, the reinvestment of the taxpayer must be in such a manner that the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction for depreciation on the replacement project. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by individual A, the purchase by A of stock in a corporation owning or constructing such a project or of an interest in a partnership owning or constructing such a project will not be considered as the purchase or construction by A of such a project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The election under section 1039(a) may be made only by the taxpayer owning the qualified housing project disposed of. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a partnership, the partnership must make the election. (See section 703(b).) Similarly, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a corporation or trust, the corporation or trust must make the election. In addition, the reinvestment of the taxpayer must be in such a manner that the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction for depreciation on the replacement project. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by individual A, the purchase by A of stock in a corporation owning or constructing such a project or of an interest in a partnership owning or constructing such a project will not be considered as the purchase or construction by A of such a project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. (i) The cost of a replacement project acquired before the approved disposition of a qualified housing project shall be taken into account under section 1039 only if such property is held by the taxpayer on the date of the approved disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cost of a replacement project acquired before the approved disposition of a qualified housing project shall be taken into account under section 1039 only if such property is held by the taxpayer on the date of the approved disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in section 1039 (d), no property acquired by the taxpayer shall be taken into account for purposes of section 1039(a)(2) unless the unadjusted basis of such property is its cost within the meaning of section

1012. For example, if a qualified housing project is acquired in an exchange under section 1031, relating to exchange of property held for productive use or investment, such property will not be taken into account under section 1039(a)(2) because its basis is determined by reference to the basis of the property exchanged. (See section 1031(d).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cost of replacement project. The taxpayer's cost for the replacement project includes only amounts properly treated as capital expenditures by the taxpayer that are attributable to acquisition, construction, or reconstruction made within the reinvestment period (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). See section 263 for rules as to what constitutes capital expenditures. Thus, assume that a calendar year taxpayer realizes gain in 1970 upon the approved disposition of a qualified housing project occurring on January 1, 1970. If the taxpayer had begun construction of another qualified housing project on January 1, 1969, and completes such construction on June 1, 1972, only that portion of the cost attributable to the period before January 1, 1972, constitutes the cost of the replacement project for purposes of section 1039. For purposes of determining the cost of a replacement project attributable to a particular period, the total cost of the project may be allocated to such period on the basis of the portion of the total project actually constructed during such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election. (i) An election not to recognize the gain realized upon an approved disposition of a qualified housing project to the extent provided in section 1039(a) may be made by attaching a statement to the income tax return filed for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain on such disposition is realized. Such a statement shall contain the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If the taxpayer does not file such a statement for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain is realized, but fails to report a portion of the gain realized upon the approved disposition as income for such year or for any subsequent taxable year, then an election shall be deemed to be made under section 1039 (a) with respect to that portion of the gain not reported as income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An election not to recognize the gain realized upon an approved disposition of a qualified housing project to the extent provided in section 1039(a) may be made by attaching a statement to the income tax return filed for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain on such disposition is realized. Such a statement shall contain the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If the taxpayer does not file such a statement for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain is realized, but fails to report a portion of the gain realized upon the approved disposition as income for such year or for any subsequent taxable year, then an election shall be deemed to be made under section 1039 (a) with respect to that portion of the gain not reported as income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election may be made under section 1039(a) even though the replacement project has not been acquired or constructed at the time of election. However, if an election has been made and (a) a replacement project is not constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, (b) the cost of the replacement project is lower than the net amount realized from the approved disposition, or (c) a decision is made not to construct, reconstruct, or acquire a replacement project, then the tax liability for the year or years for which the election was made shall be recomputed and an amended return filed. An election may be made even though the taxpayer has filed his return and recognized gain upon the disposition provided that the period of limitation on filing claims for credit or refund prescribed by section 6511 has not expired. In such case, a statement containing the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph should be filed together with a claim for credit or refund for the taxable year or years in which gain was recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The statement referred to in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The date of the approved disposition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a replacement project has been acquired, the date of acquisition and cost of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a replacement project has been constructed or reconstructed by or for the taxpayer, the date construction was begun, the date construction was completed, and the percentage of construction completed within the reinvestment period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If no replacement project has been constructed, reconstructed, or acquired prior to the time of filing of the statement, the estimated cost of such construction, reconstruction, or acquisition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The adjusted basis of the project disposed of; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The amount realized upon the approved disposition and a description of the expenses directly connected with the disposition and the taxes (other

than income taxes) attributable to the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--(1) General. The definitions contained in subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph shall apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The definitions contained in subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph shall apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified housing project. The term qualified housing project means a rental or cooperative housing project for lower income families that has been constructed, reconstructed, or rehabilitated pursuant to a mortgage which is insured under section 221(d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act, provided that with respect to the housing project disposed of and the replacement project constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, the owner of the project at the time of the approved disposition and prior to the close of the reinvestment period is, under such sections or regulations issued thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limited as to rate of return on his investment in the project, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limited as to rentals or occupancy charges for units in the project.
If the owner of the project is organized and operated as a nonprofit cooperative or other nonprofit organization, then such owner shall be considered to meet the requirement of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approved disposition. The term approved disposition means a sale or other disposition of a qualified housing project to the tenants or occupants of units in such project, or to a nonprofit cooperative or other nonprofit organization formed and operated solely for the benefit of such tenants or occupants, provided that it is approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate under section 221 (d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act or regulations issued under such sections. Evidence of such approval should be attached to the tax return or statement in which the election under section 1039 is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reinvestment period. (i) The term reinvestment period means the period beginning 1 year before the date of the disposition and ending 1 year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, or at such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application made by the taxpayer. Such application shall be made before the expiration of one year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, unless the taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the district director that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reasonable cause exists for not having filed the application within the required period, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The filing of such application was made within a reasonable time after the expiration of the required period.
The application shall contain all the information required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section and shall be made to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return is filed for the first taxable year in which any of the gain from the approved disposition is realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ordinarily, requests for extension of the reinvestment period will not be granted until near the end of such period and any extension will usually be limited to a period not exceeding one year. Although granting of an extension depends upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case, if a predominant portion of the construction of the replacement project has been completed or is reasonably expected to be completed within the reinvestment period (determined without regard to any extension thereof), an extension of the reinvestment period will ordinarily be granted. The fact that there is a scarcity of replacement property for acquisition will not be considered sufficient grounds for granting an extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Net amount realized. (i) The net amount realized from the approved disposition of a qualified housing project is the amount realized from such disposition, reduced by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are directly connected with the approved disposition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of taxes (other than income taxes) paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are attributable to the approved disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of expenses directly connected with an approved disposition of a qualified housing project include amounts paid for sales or other commissions, advertising, and for the preparation of a deed or other legal services

in connection with the disposition. An amount paid for a repair to the building will be considered as an expense directly connected with the approved disposition under subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph only if such repair is required as a condition of sale, or is required by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate as a condition of approval of the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples of taxes that are attributable to the approved disposition include local property transfer taxes and stamp taxes. A local real property tax is not so attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Basis and holding period of replacement project--(1) Basis. If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1039, the basis of the replacement housing project shall be its cost (including costs incurred subsequent to the reinvestment period) reduced by the amount of gain not recognized under section 1039 (a). If the replacement consists of more than one housing project, the basis determined under this subparagraph shall be allocated to the properties in proportion to their respective costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Basis. If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1039, the basis of the replacement housing project shall be its cost (including costs incurred subsequent to the reinvestment period) reduced by the amount of gain not recognized under section 1039 (a). If the replacement consists of more than one housing project, the basis determined under this subparagraph shall be allocated to the properties in proportion to their respective costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Holding period. The holding period of the replacement housing project shall begin on the date the taxpayer acquires such project, that is, on the date the taxpayer first acquires possession or control of such project and bears the burdens and enjoys the benefits of ownership of the replacement project. (For special rule regarding the holding period of property for purposes of section 1250, see section 1250(e)(4).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assessment of deficiencies--(1) Deficiency attributable to gain. If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1039(a) with respect to an approved disposition, any deficiency attributable to the gain on such disposition, for any taxable year in which any part of such gain is realized, may be assessed at any time before the expiration of 3 years after the date the district director or director of the regional service center with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the acquisition or the completion of construction or reconstruction of the replacement qualified housing project or of the failure to acquire, construct, or reconstruct a replacement qualified housing project, as the case may be. Such a deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain the information required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Such notification shall be attached to the return filed for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or in which the period for the replacement expires, and a copy of such notification shall be filed with the district director or director of regional service center with whom the election under section 1039(a) was required to be filed, if the return is not filed with such director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deficiency attributable to gain. If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1039(a) with respect to an approved disposition, any deficiency attributable to the gain on such disposition, for any taxable year in which any part of such gain is realized, may be assessed at any time before the expiration of 3 years after the date the district director or director of the regional service center with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the acquisition or the completion of construction or reconstruction of the replacement qualified housing project or of the failure to acquire, construct, or reconstruct a replacement qualified housing project, as the case may be. Such a deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain the information required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Such notification shall be attached to the return filed for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or in which the period for the replacement expires, and a copy of such notification shall be filed with the district director or director of regional service center with whom the election under section 1039(a) was required to be filed, if the return is not filed with such director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deficiency attributable to election. If gain upon an approved disposition is realized in two (or more) taxable years, and the replacement qualified housing project was acquired, constructed, or reconstructed before the beginning of the last such year, any deficiency, for any taxable year before such last year, which is attributable to an election by the taxpayer under section 1039(a) may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such last taxable year may be assessed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. Thus, if gain upon an approved disposition is realized in 1971 and 1975, and if a replacement project is purchased in 1971, any deficiency for 1971 may be assessed within the period for assessing a deficiency for 1975.
[T.D. 7191, 37 FR 12951, June 30, 1972; 37 FR 14385, July 20, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7400, 41 FR 5101, Feb. 4, 1976]


Sec. 1.1041-1T  Treatment of transfer of property between spousesor incident to divorce (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: How is the transfer of property between spouses treated under section 1041?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Generally, no gain or loss is recognized on a transfer of property from an individual to (or in trust for the benefit of) a spouse or, if the transfer is incident to a divorce, a former spouse.

The following questions and answers describe more fully the scope, tax consequences and other rules which apply to transfers of property under section 1041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope of section 1041 in general.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Does section 1041 apply only to transfers of property incident to divorce?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: No. Section 1041 is not limited to transfers of property incident to divorce. Section 1041 applies to any transfer of property between spouses regardless of whether the transfer is a gift or is a sale or exchange between spouses acting at arm's length (including a transfer in exchange for the relinquishment of property or marital rights or an exchange otherwise governed by another nonrecognition provision of the Code). A divorce or legal separation need not be contemplated between the spouses at the time of the transfer nor must a divorce or legal separation ever occur.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A and B are married and file a joint return. A is the sole owner of a condominium unit. A sale or gift of the condominium from A to B is a transfer which is subject to the rules of section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A and B are married and file separate returns. A is the owner of an independent sole proprietorship, X Company. In the ordinary course of business, X Company makes a sale of property to B. This sale is a transfer of property between spouses and is subject to the rules of section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that X Company is a corporation wholly owned by A. This sale is not a sale between spouses subject to the rules of section 1041. However, in appropriate circumstances, general tax principles, including the step-transaction doctrine, may be applicable in recharacterizing the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Do the rules of section 1041 apply to a transfer between spouses if the transferee spouse is a nonresident alien?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: No. Gain or loss (if any) is recognized (assuming no other nonrecognition provision applies) at the time of a transfer of property if the property is transferred to a spouse who is a nonresident alien.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What kinds of transfers are governed by section 1041?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Only transfers of property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) are governed by section 1041. Transfers of services are not subject to the rules of section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Must the property transferred to a former spouse have been owned by the transferor spouse during the marriage?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. A transfer of property acquired after the marriage ceases may be governed by section 1041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transfer incident to the divorce.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: When is a transfer of property incident to the divorce?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: A transfer of property is incident to the divorce in either of the following 2 circumstances--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The transfer occurs not more than one year after the date on which the marriage ceases, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transfer is related to the cessation of the marriage.
Thus, a transfer of property occurring not more than one year after the date on which the marriage ceases need not be related to the cessation of the marriage to qualify for section 1041 treatment. (See A-7 for transfers occurring more than one year after the cessation of the marriage.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: When is a transfer of property related to the cessation of the marriage?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: A transfer of property is treated as related to the cessation of the marriage if the transfer is pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument, as defined in section 71(b)(2), and the transfer occurs not more than 6 years after the date on which the marriage ceases. A divorce or separation instrument includes a modification or amendment to such decree or instrument. Any transfer not pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument and any transfer occurring more than 6 years after the cessation of the marriage is presumed to be not related to the cessation of the marriage. This presumption may be rebutted only by showing that the transfer was made to effect the division of property owned by the former spouses at the time of the cessation of the marriage. For example, the presumption may be rebutted by showing that (a) the transfer was not made within the one- and six-year periods described above because of factors which hampered an earlier transfer of the property, such as legal or business impediments to transfer or disputes concerning the value of the property

owned at the time of the cessation of the marriage, and (b) the transfer is effected promptly after the impediment to transfer is removed.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: Do annulments and the cessations of marriages that are void ab initio due to violations of state law constitute divorces for purposes of section 1041?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: Yes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfers on behalf of a spouse.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: May transfers of property to third parties on behalf of a spouse (or former spouse) qualify under section 1041?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Yes. There are three situations in which a transfer of property to a third party on behalf of a spouse (or former spouse) will qualify under section 1041, provided all other requirements of the section are satisfied. The first situation is where the transfer to the third party is required by a divorce or separation instrument. The second situation is where the transfer to the third party is pursuant to the written request of the other spouse (or former spouse). The third situation is where the transferor receives from the other spouse (or former spouse) a written consent or ratification of the transfer to the third party. Such consent or ratification must state that the parties intend the transfer to be treated as a transfer to the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) subject to the rules of section 1041 and must be received by the transferor prior to the date of filing of the transferor's first return of tax for the taxable year in which the transfer was made. In the three situations described above, the transfer of property will be treated as made directly to the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) and the nontransferring spouse will be treated as immediately transferring the property to the third party. The deemed transfer from the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) to the third party is not a transaction that qualifies for nonrecognition of gain under section 1041. This A-9 shall not apply to transfers to which Sec. 1.1041-2 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tax consequences of transfers subject to section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: How is the transferor of property under section 1041 treated for income tax purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: The transferor of property under section 1041 recognizes no gain or loss on the transfer even if the transfer was in exchange for the release of marital rights or other consideration. This rule applies regardless of whether the transfer is of property separately owned by the transferor or is a division (equal or unequal) of community property. Thus, the result under section 1041 differs from the result in United States v. Davis, 370 U.S. 65 (1962).</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: How is the transferee of property under section 1041 treated for income tax purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: The transferee of property under section 1041 recognizes no gain or loss upon receipt of the transferred property. In all cases, the basis of the transferred property in the hands of the transferee is the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer. Even if the transfer is a bona fide sale, the transferee does not acquire a basis in the transferred property equal to the transferee's cost (the fair market value). This carryover basis rule applies whether the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of transfer (or the value of any consideration provided by the transferee) and applies for purposes of determining loss as well as gain upon the subsequent disposition of the property by the transferee. Thus, this rule is different from the rule applied in section 1015(a) for determining the basis of property acquired by gift.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Do the rules described in A-10 and A-11 apply even if the transferred property is subject to liabilities which exceed the adjusted basis of the property?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: Yes. For example, assume A owns property having a fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted basis of $1,000. In contemplation of making a transfer of this property incident to a divorce from B, A borrows $5,000 from a bank, using the property as security for the borrowing. A then transfers the property to B and B assumes, or takes the property subject to, the liability to pay the $5,000 debt. Under section 1041, A recognizes no gain or loss upon the

transfer of the property, and the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of B is $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: Will a transfer under section 1041 result in a recapture of investment tax credits with respect to the property transferred?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: In general, no. Property transferred under section 1041 will not be treated as being disposed of by, or ceasing to be section 38 property with respect to, the transferor. However, the transferee will be subject to investment tax credit recapture if, upon or after the transfer, the property is disposed of by, or ceases to be section 38 property with respect to, the transferee. For example, as part of a divorce property settlement, B receives a car from A that has been used in A's business for two years and for which an investment tax credit was taken by A. No part of A's business is transferred to B and B's use of the car is solely personal. B is subject to recapture of the investment tax credit previously taken by A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice and recordkeeping requirement with respect to transactions under section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: Does the trasnsferor of property in a transaction described in section 1041 have to supply, at the time of the transfer, the transferee with records sufficient to determine the adjusted basis and holding period of the property at the time of the transfer and (if applicable) with notice that the property transferred under section 1041 is potentially subject to recapture of the investment tax credit?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: Yes. A transferor of property under section 1041 must, at the time of the transfer, supply the transferee with records sufficient to determine the adjusted basis and holding period of the property as of the date of the transfer. In addition, in the case of a transfer of property which carries with it a potential liability for investment tax credit recapture, the transferor must, at the time of the transfer, supply the transferee with records sufficient to determine the amount and period of such potential liability. Such records must be preserved and kept accessible by the transferee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Property settlements--effective dates, transitional periods and elections.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: When does section 1041 become effective?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: Generally, section 1041 applies to all transfers after July 18, 1984. However, it does not apply to transfers after July 18, 1984 pursuant to instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984. (See A-16 with respect to exceptions to the general rule.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Are there any exceptions to the general rule stated in A-15 above?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: Yes. Two transitional rules provide exceptions to the general rule stated in A-15. First, section 1041 will apply to transfers after July 18, 1984 under instruments that were in effect on or before July 18, 1984 if both spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply to such transfers. Second, section 1041 will apply to all transfers after December 31, 1983 (including transfers under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984) if both spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply. (See A-18 relating to the time and manner of making the elections under the first or second transitional rule.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: Can an election be made to have section 1041 apply to some, but not all, transfers made after December 31, 1983, or some but not all, transfers made after July 18, 1984 under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: No. Partial elections are not allowed. An election under either of the two elective transitional rules applies to all transfers governed by that election whether before or after the election is made, and is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Property settlements--time and manner of making the elections under section 1041.</p><p class="depth0">Q-18: How do spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply to transfers after December 31, 1983, or to transfers after July 18, 1984 under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-18: In order to make an election under section 1041 for property transfers after December 31, 1983, or property transfers under instruments that were in effect on or before July 18, 1984, both spouses (or former spouses) must elect the application of the rules of section 1041 by attaching to the transferor's first filed income tax return for

the taxable year in which the first transfer occurs, a statement signed by both spouses (or former spouses) which includes each spouse's social security number and is in substantially the form set forth at the end of this answer.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the transferor must attach a copy of such statement to his or her return for each subsequent taxable year in which a transfer is made that is governed by the transitional election. A copy of the signed statment must be kept by both parties.</p><p class="depth0">The election statements shall be in substantially the following form:</p><p class="depth0">In the case of an election regarding transfers after 1983:</p><p class="depth0">Section 1041 Election</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned hereby elect to have the provisions of section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to all qualifying transfers of property after December 31, 1983. The undersigned understand that section 1041 applies to all property transferred between spouses, or former spouses incident to divorce. The parties further understand that the effects for Federal income tax purposes of having section 1041 apply are that (1) no gain or loss is recognized by the transferor spouse or former spouse as a result of this transfer; and (2) the basis of the transferred property in the hands of the transferee is the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, whether or not the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of the transfer. The undersigned understand that if the transferee spouse or former spouse disposes of the property in a transaction in which gain is recognized, the amount of gain which is taxable may be larger than it would have been if this election had not been made.</p><p class="depth0">In the case of an election regarding preexisting decrees:</p><p class="depth0">Section 1041 Election</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned hereby elect to have the provisions of section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to all qualifying transfers of property after July 18, 1984 under any instrument in effect on or before July 18, 1984.
