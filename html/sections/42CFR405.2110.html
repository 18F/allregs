The designation of networks does not require an ESRD patient to seek care only through the facilities in the designated network where the patient resides, nor does the designation of networks limit patient choice of physicians or facilities, or preclude patient referral by physicians to a facility in another designated network.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Redesignation of networks. CMS will redesignate networks, as needed, to ensure that the designations are consistent with ESRD program experience, consistent with ESRD program

objectives specified in Sec. 405.2101, and compatible with efficient program administration.
