                            <p class="depth0">This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports for international nuclear safeguards; U.S. government agencies or personnel; agencies of cooperating governments; international inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and the International Space Station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> International safeguards--(1) Scope. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an international organization that establishes and administers safeguards, including Additional Protocols, designed to ensure that special nuclear materials and other related nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not diverted from peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes. European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) is an international organization of European countries with headquarters in Luxembourg. Euratom establishes and administers safeguards designed to ensure that special nuclear materials and other related nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not diverted from peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes. This paragraph (a) authorizes exports and reexports of commodities or software to the IAEA and Euratom, and reexports by IAEA and Euratom for official international safeguard use, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commodities or software consigned to the IAEA at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria or its field offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada or in Tokyo, Japan for official international safeguards use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commodities or software consigned to the Euratom Safeguards Directorate in Luxembourg, Luxembourg for official international safeguards use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commodities or software consigned to IAEA or Euratom may be reexported to any country for IAEA or Euratom international safeguards use provided that IAEA or Euratom maintains control of or otherwise safeguards the commodities or software and returns the commodities or software to the locations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section when they become obsolete, are no longer required, or are replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Commodity or software shipments may be made by persons under direct contract with IAEA or Euratom, or by Department of Energy National Laboratories as directed by the Department of State or the Department of Energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The monitoring functions of IAEA and Euratom are not subject to the restrictions on prohibited safeguarded nuclear activities described in Sec. 744.2(a)(3) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When commodities or software originally consigned to IAEA or Euratom are no longer in IAEA or Euratom official safeguards use, such commodities may be disposed of by destruction or by reexport or transfer in accordance with the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions. (i) Items on the Sensitive List (see supplement no. 6 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a), except to the countries listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items on the Very Sensitive List (see supplement no. 7 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, or 5E002 may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a).

The ISS is a research facility in a low-Earth orbit approximately 190 miles (350 km) above the surface of the Earth. The ISS is a joint project among the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Europe and Italy. This paragraph (e) authorizes exports and reexports required on short notice of certain commodities subject to the EAR that are classified under ECCN 9A004 to launch sites for supply missions to the ISS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible commodities. Any commodity subject to the EAR that is classified under ECCN 9A004 and that is required for use on the ISS on short notice.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1 to paragraph (e)(2): This license exception is not available for the export or reexport of ``parts,'' ``components,'' ``accessories,'' and ``attachments'' to overseas manufacturers for the purpose of incorporation into other items destined for the ISS.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2 to paragraph (e)(2): For purposes of this paragraph (e), `short notice' means the exporter is required to have a commodity manifested and at the scheduled launch site for hatch-closure (final stowage) no more than forty-five (45) days from the time the exporter or reexporter received complete documentation. `Complete documentation' means the exporter or reexporter received the technical description of the commodity and purpose for use of the commodity on the ISS. `Hatch-closure (final stowage)' means the final date specified by a launch provider by which items must be at a specified location in a launch country in order to be included on a mission to the ISS. The exporter or reexporter must receive the notification to supply the commodity for use on the ISS in writing. That notification must be kept in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) of this section and the Recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Eligible destinations. Eligible destinations are France, Japan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. To be eligible, a destination needs to have a launch for a supply mission to the ISS scheduled by a country participating in the ISS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirement for commodities to be launched on an eligible space launch vehicle (SLV). Only commodities that will be delivered to the ISS using United States, Russian, ESA (French), or Japanese space launch vehicles (SLVs) are eligible under this authorization. Commodities to be delivered to the ISS using SLVs from any other countries are excluded from this authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Authorizations--(i) Authorization to retain commodity at or near launch site for up to six months. If there are unexpected delays in a launch schedule for reasons such as mechanical failures in a launch vehicle or weather, commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) may be retained at or near the launch site for a period of six (6) months from the time of initial export or reexport before the commodities must be destroyed, returned to the exporter or reexporter, or be the subject of an individually validated license request submitted to BIS to authorize further disposition of the commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authorization to retain commodity abroad at launch country beyond six months. If, after the commodity is exported or reexported under this authorization, a delay occurs in the launch schedule that would exceed the 6-month deadline in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the exporter or reexporter or the person in control of the commodities in the launch country may request a one-time 6-month extension by submitting written notification to BIS requesting a 6-month extension and noting the reason for the delay. If the requestor is not contacted by BIS within 30 days from the date of the postmark of the written notification and if the notification meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the request is deemed granted. The request must be sent to BIS at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR and should include the name and address of the exporter or reexporter, the name and address of the person who has control of the commodity, the date the commodities were exported or reexported, a brief product description, and the justification for the extension. To retain a commodity abroad beyond the 6-month extension period, the exporter, reexporter or person in control of the commodity must request authorization by submitting a license application in accordance with Sec. Sec. 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR to BIS 90 days prior to the expiration of the 6-month extension period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Items not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch. If the commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) of this section are not delivered to the ISS because a failed launch causes the destruction of the commodity prior to its being delivered, exporters and reexporters must make note of the destruction of the commodities in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section and part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reexports to an alternate launch country. If a mechanical or weather related issue causes a change from the scheduled launch country to another foreign country after a commodity was exported or reexported, then that commodity may be subsequently reexported to the new scheduled launch country, provided all of the terms and conditions of paragraph (e) of this section are met, along with any other applicable EAR provisions. In such instances, the 6-month time limitation

described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section would start over again at the time of the subsequent reexport transaction. Note that if the subsequent reexport may be made under the designation No License Required (NLR) or pursuant to an authorization under the EAR, a reexporter does not need to rely on the provisions contained in this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Eligible recipients. Only persons involved in the launch of commodities to the ISS may receive and have access to commodities exported or reexported pursuant to this paragraph (e), except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No commodities may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under paragraph (e) to any national of an E:1 country (see Supplement No. 1 to this part), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No person may receive commodities authorized under paragraph (e) of this section who is subject to an end-user or end-use control described in part 744 of the EAR, including the entity list in supplement no. 4 to part 744.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. Exporters and reexporters must maintain records regarding exports or reexports made using this paragraph (e) of this section as well as any other applicable recordkeeping requirements under part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exporters and reexporters must retain a record of the initial written notification they received requesting these commodities be supplied on short notice for a supply mission to the ISS, including the date the exporter or reexporter received complete documentation (i.e., the day on which the 45-day clock begins).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exporters and reexporters must maintain records of the date of any exports or reexports made using this paragraph (e) and the date on which the commodities were launched into space for delivery to the ISS. If the commodities are not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch whereby the item is destroyed prior to being delivered to the ISS, this must be noted for recordkeeping purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The return or destruction of defective or worn out parts or components is not required. However, if defective or worn out parts or components originally exported or reexported pursuant to this paragraph (e) are returned from the ISS, then those parts and components may be either: returned to the original country of export or reexport; destroyed; or reexported or transferred (in-country) to a destination that has been designated by NASA for conducting a review and analysis of the defective or worn part or component. Documentation for this activity must be kept for recordkeeping purposes. No commodities that are subject to the EAR may be returned, under the provisions of this paragraph, to a country listed in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) or to any person if that person is subject to an end-user or end-use control described in part 744 of the EAR. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a `defective or worn out' part or component is a part or component that no longer performs its intended function.
