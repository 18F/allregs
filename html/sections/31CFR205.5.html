                                Sec. 205.5  What are the thresholds for major Federal assistance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Table A of this section defines major Federal assistance  programs based on the dollar amount of an individual Federal assistance  program and the dollar amount of all Federal assistance being received  by a State for all Federal assistance programs including non-cash  programs. A State must locate the appropriate row in Column A based upon  the total amount of Federal assistance received. In that same row, a  State must apply the percentage from Column B to the dollar value of all  its Federal assistance programs to determine the State's threshold for  major Federal assistance programs. For example, if the total amount  received by a State for all Federal assistance programs is $50 million,  then that State's threshold for major Federal assistance programs is 6%  of $50 million or $3 million. A State which receives more than $10  billion under Federal assistance programs will have a minimum default  threshold of $60 million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To ensure adequate coverage of all State programs, a State must,  on an annual basis, compare its program coverage using the percentage  obtained from Table A to the program coverage which would result using a  percentage which is half of the percentage obtained from Table A. For  example, a State receiving $1 billion in Federal Assistance would use  Table A to learn that its threshold level would be .60 percent of $1  billion. A State would compare program coverage at .60 percent of $1  billion to program coverage at .30 percent of $1 billion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the comparison conducted under paragraph (b) of this section  results in a reduction of program coverage that is greater than 10%, a  State must lower its threshold, or add programs, until the difference is  less than or equal to 10%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with Sec. 205.3(b), a State may lower its  threshold to include additional programs. All of a State's programs that  meet this lower threshold would be subject to this subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless specified otherwise, major Federal assistance programs  must be determined from the most recent Single Audit data available.</p><p class="depth2">Table A to Sec. 205.5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Column B Major Federal</p><p class="depth2">Column A Total amount of Federal       Assistance Program means any</p><p class="depth2">Assistance for all programs per State:  Federal assistance program that</p><p class="depth2">exceed these levels: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Between zero and $100 million inclusive  6.00 percent of the total</p><p class="depth2">amount of Federal assistance.
