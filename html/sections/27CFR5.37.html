The alcohol content for  distilled spirits shall be stated in percent-alcohol-by-volume. Products  such as ``Rock and Rye. or similar products containing a significant  amount of solid material shall state the alcohol content at the time of  bottling as follows: ``Bottled at ------ percent-alcohol-by-volume.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Optional statement. In addition, the label may also state the  alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information appears in  direct conjunction (i.e., with no intervening material) with the  statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume. If both forms of  alcohol content are shown, the optional statement in degrees of proof  shall be placed in parentheses, in brackets, or otherwise distinguished  from the mandatory statement in percent-alcohol-by-by-volume to  emphasize the fact that both expressions of alcohol content mean the  same thing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tolerances. The following tolerances shall be allowed (without  affecting the labeled statement of alcohol content) for losses of  alcohol content occurring during bottling:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not to exceed 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for spirits  containing solids in excess of 600 mg per 100 ml; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not to exceed 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for any spirits  product bottled in 50 or 100 ml size bottles; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not to exceed 0.15 percent alcohol by volume for all other  spirits.
