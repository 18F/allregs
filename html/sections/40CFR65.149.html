(1) Owners or operators using boilers and process heaters to meet the 98 weight-percent emission reduction or 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration requirement as specified in Sec. 65.63(a)(2), or 40 CFR 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(B) for process vents, or Sec. 65.83(a)(1) for high-throughput transfer racks, as applicable, shall meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners or operators using boilers and process heaters to meet the 98 weight-percent emission reduction or 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration requirement as specified in Sec. 65.63(a)(2), or 40 CFR 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(B) for process vents, or Sec. 65.83(a)(1) for high-throughput transfer racks, as applicable, shall meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Boilers and process heaters used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions are vented to them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Boiler and process heater performance test requirements. (1) Unless an initial performance test was previously conducted and submitted under the referencing subpart, and except as specified in Sec. 65.157(b) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test of any boiler or process heater used to comply with the provisions of this subpart according to the procedures in Sec. Sec. 65.157 and 65.158. Performance test records shall be kept as specified in Sec. 65.160(a) and (b), and a performance test report shall be submitted as specified in Sec. 65.164. As provided in Sec. 65.145(b)(1), a performance test may be used as an alternative to the design evaluation for storage vessels and low-throughput transfer rack controls.

Upon implementing the change, a boiler or process heater performance test shall be performed using the methods specified in Sec. Sec. 65.157 and 65.158 within 180 days if required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The performance test report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days of completing the determination as provided in Sec. 65.164(b)(2). If an owner or operator elects to use a boiler or process heater to replace an existing recovery device that is used on a Group 2A process vent, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 65.63(e) and 65.67(b) and submit the notification specified in Sec. 65.167(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boiler and process heater monitoring requirements. (1) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts (150 million British thermal units per hour) design heat input capacity is used and the regulated vent stream is not introduced as or with the primary fuel, a temperature monitoring device in the fire box capable of providing a continuous record is required. Any boiler or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced with primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from monitoring. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 65.161. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec. 65.156.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts (150 million British thermal units per hour) design heat input capacity is used and the regulated vent stream is not introduced as or with the primary fuel, a temperature monitoring device in the fire box capable of providing a continuous record is required.

In order to establish the range, the information required in Sec. 65.165(c) shall be submitted in the Initial Compliance Status Report or the operating permit application or amendment. The range may be based upon a prior performance test meeting the specifications of Sec. 65.157(b)(1) or upon existing ranges or limits established under a referencing subpart.</p>
