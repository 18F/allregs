You may file a written request for the  expedited appeals process at one of our offices, the Veterans  Administration Regional Office in the Philippines, or an office of the  Railroad Retirement Board if you have 10 or more years of service in the  railroad industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension of time to request expedited appeals process. If you  want to use the expedited appeals process but do not request it within  the stated time period, you may ask for more time to submit your  request. Your request for an extension of time must be in writing and  must give the reasons why the request for the expedited appeals process  was not filed within the stated time period. If you show that you had  good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended.  To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained  in Sec. 404.911.</p>
