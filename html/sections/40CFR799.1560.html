Control males shall be cohabited with control females, and males and  females administered the high dose shall be cohabited. Endpoints to be  evaluated shall include percent mated; percent pregnant; length of  gestation; litter size; viability at birth, on Day 4, and weaning, on  Day 21; sex of the offspring; and litter weights at birth and Days 4, 7,  14, and 21. Litters shall be standardized on day 4 in accordance with  the reproductive and fertility effects guideline, Sec.  798.4700(c)(6)(iv) of this chapter. Gross examinations shall be made at  least once each day and physical or behavioral anomalies in the dam or  offspring shall be recorded. At weaning, dams shall be sacrificed and  examined for resorption sites indicative of post-implantation loss. An  additional 20 males and 40 females will have to be added to the  subchronic study for this test. If the animals in the high dose group  exhibit marked toxicity (e.g. greater than 20 percent   weight loss), then the fertility tests shall be conducted in the next  highest dose group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cage-side observations shall include, but not be limited to,  changes in skin and fur; eyes and mucous membranes; respiratory,  circulatory autonomic, and central nervous systems; somatomotor  activity; and behavior pattern. In addition a daily examination for  hematuria shall be done.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least  three times during the test period: Just prior to initiation of dosing  (baseline data), after approximately 30 days on test, and just prior to  terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Hematology  determinations which are appropriate to all studies: Hematocrit,  hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, total and differential  leucocyte count, mean corpuscular volume, and a platelet count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Urinalyses shall be done at least three times during the test  period: Just prior to initiation of dosing (baseline data), after  approximately 30 days into the test, and just prior to terminal  sacrifice at the end of the test period. The animals shall be kept in  metabolism cages, and the urine shall be examined microscopically for  the presence of erythrocytes and renal tubular cells, in addition to  measurement of urine volume, specific gravity, glucose, protein/albumin,  and blood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The liver, kidney, adrenals, brain, gonads, prostate gland,  epididymides, seminal vesicles, and pituitary gland shall be weighed  wet, as soon as possible after dissection, to avoid drying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The following organs and tissues, or representative samples  thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future  histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs--which should be  removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure  that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is  considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues;  brain--including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and  cerebral cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart;  sternum with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys;  adrenals; pancreas; gonads; uterus; oviducts; vagina; vas deferens;  accessory genital organs (epididymis, prostate, and, if present, seminal  vesicles); aorta; (skin); gall bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach;  duodenum; jejunum; ileum; cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder;  representative lymph node; (mammary gland); (thigh musculature);  peripheral nerve; (eyes); (femur--including articular surface); (spinal  cord at three levels--cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal  and exorbital lachrymal glands).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> (i) Full histopathology on normal and treated skin and on organs  and tissues listed in paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)(6)</em> of this section, as well  as the accessory genital organs (epididymides, prostate, seminal  vesicles) and the vagina, of all animals in the control and high dose  groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The integrity of the various cell stages of spermatogenesis  shall be determined, with particular attention directed toward achieving  optimal quality in the fixation and embedding; preparations of  testicular and associated reproductive organ samples for histology  should follow the recommendations of Lamb and Chapin (1985) under  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or an equivalent procedure.  Histological analyses shall include evaluations of the spermatogenic  cycle, i.e., the presence and integrity of the 14 cell stages. These  evaluations should follow the guidance provided by Clermont and Perey  (1957) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Information shall also be  provided regarding the nature and level of lesions observed in control  animals for comparative purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Data on female cyclicity shall be obtained by performing  vaginal cytology over the last 2 weeks of dosing; the cell staging  technique of Sadleir (1978) and the vaginal smear method in Hafez (1970)  under paragraphs (d) (3) and (7) of this section or equivalent methods  should be used. Data should be provided on whether the animal is cycling  and the cycle length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The ovary shall be serially sectioned with a sufficient number  of sections examined to adequately detail oocyte and follicular  morphology. The methods of Mattison and Thorgiersson (1979) and Pederson  and Peters (1968) under paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this   section may provide guidance. The strategy for sectioning and evaluation  is left to the discretion of the investigator, but shall be described in  detail in the study plan and final report. The nature and background  level of lesions in control tissue shall also be noted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The subchronic test shall be  completed and the final report submitted to EPA within 15 months of the  effective date of the final test rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Progress reports shall be submitted to EPA every 6 months,  beginning 6 months from the effective date of the final rule until  submission of the final report to EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Neurotoxicity/behavioral effects--(i) Required testing--(A) (1)  Functional observational battery. A functional observational battery  shall be performed in the rat by dermal application of DGBE for a period  of 90 days according to Sec. 798.6050 of this chapter except for the  provisions in paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(4)(ii), (5), and (8)(ii)(E) of  Sec. 798.6050.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. Neurotoxicity is any adverse acute and/or lasting  effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral  nervous system related to exposure to a chemical substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either  graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested  including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any  dose tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed  for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sensory function. A simple assessment of sensory function  (vision, audition, pain perception) shall be made. Marshall et al.  (1971) in Sec. 798.6050(f)(8) of this chapter have described a  neurologic exam for this purpose; these procedures are also discussed by  Deuel (1977), under Sec. 798.6050(f)(4) of this chapter. Irwin (1968)  under Sec. 798.6050(f)(7) of this chapter described a number of reflex  tests intended to detect gross sensory deficits. Many procedures have  been developed for assessing pain perception (e.g., Ankier (1974) under  Sec. 798.6050(f)(1); D'Amour and Smith (1941) under Sec.  798.6050(f)(3); and Evans (1971) under Sec. 798.6050(f)(6) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Motor activity. A motor activity test shall be conducted in  the rat by dermal application of DGBE for a period of 90 days according  to Sec. 798.6200 of this chapter except for the provisions in  paragraphs (c), (d)(3)(ii), (4)(ii), (5), (8)(i), and (iii) of Sec.  798.6200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered  to several groups of experimental animals, one dose being used per  group. Measurements of motor activity are made. Where possible, the  exposure levels at which significant changes in motor activity are  produced are compared to those levels which produce toxic effects not  originating in the central and/or peripheral nervous system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Positive control data. Positive control data are required to  document the sensitivity of the activity measuring device and testing  procedure. These data should demonstrate the ability to detect increases  or decreases in activity and to generate a dose-effect curve or its  equivalent using three values of the dose or equivalent independent  variable. A single administration of the dose (or equivalent) is  sufficient. It is recommended that chemical exposure be used to collect  positive control data. Positive control data shall be collected at the  time of the test study unless the laboratory can demonstrate the  adequacy of historical data for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either  graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested  including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any  dose tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed  for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> General. Motor activity shall be monitored by an automated  activity recording apparatus. The device used shall be capable of  detecting both increases and decreases in activity, i.e. baseline  activity as measured by the   device shall not be so low as to preclude decreases nor so high as to  preclude increases. Each device shall be tested by a standard procedure  to ensure, to the extent possible, reliability of operation across  devices and across days for any one device. In addition, treatment  groups shall be balanced across devices. Each animal shall be tested  individually. The test session shall be long enough for motor activity  to approach asymptotic levels by the last 20 percent of the session for  most treatments and for the session control animals. All sessions should  be of the same duration. Treatment groups shall be counter-balanced  across test times. Effort should be made to ensure that variations in  the test conditions are minimal and are not systematically related to  treatment. Among the variables which can affect motor activity are sound  level, size and shape of the test cage, temperature, relative humidity,  lighting conditions, odors, use of home cage or novel test cage, and  environmental distractions. Tests shall be executed by an appropriately  trained individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Subchronic. All animals shall be tested prior to initiation of  exposure and at 30 4, 60 4,  and 90 4 days during the exposure period. Testing  shall occur prior to the daily exposure. Animals shall be weighed on  each test day and at least once weekly during the exposure period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, and (E)(2) of Sec. 798.6400.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either  graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested  including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any  dose tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed  for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Clearing and embedding. After dehydration, tissue specimens  shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast  except for the sural nerve which should be embedded in plastic. Multiple  tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded together in  one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be labeled to  provide unequivocal identification. A method for plastic embedding is  described by Spencer et al. in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special stains. Based on the results of the general staining,  selected sites and cellular components shall be further evaluated by the  use of specific techniques. If hematoxylin and eosin screening does not  provide such information, a battery of stains shall be used to assess  the following components in all appropriate required samples: Neuronal  body (e.g., Einarson's gallocyanin), axon (e.g., Bodian), myelin sheath  (e.g., Kluver's Luxol Fast Blue), and neurofibrils (e.g., Bielchosky).  In addition, peripheral nerve fiber teasing may be used. Detailed  staining methodology is available in standard histotechnological manuals  such as Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) (1968) under Sec.  798.6400(f)(1), Ralis et al. (1973) under Sec. 798.6400(f)(5), and  Chang (1979) under Sec. 798.6400(f)(2) of this chapter. The nerve fiber  teasing technique is discussed in Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under  Sec. 798.6400(f)(6) of this chapter. A section of normal tissue shall  be included in each staining to assure that adequate staining has  occurred. Any changes shall be noted and representative photographs  shall be taken. If a lesion(s) is observed, the special techniques shall  be repeated in the next lower treatment group until no further lesion is  detectable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The neurotoxicity/behavioral tests  required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be completed and  the final reports submitted to EPA within 17 months of the effective  date of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interim progress reports shall be submitted to EPA at 6-month  intervals, beginning 6 months from the effective date of the final rule  until submission of the applicable final report to EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Developmental neurotoxicity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required testing. A  developmental neurotoxicity test of DGBE shall be   conducted after a public program review of the Tier I data from the  functional observational battery, motor activity, and neuropathology  tests in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the reproductive tests in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and if EPA issues a Federal Register  notice or sends a certified letter to the test sponsor specifying that  the testing shall be initiated. The test shall be performed in rats in  accordance with Sec. 795.250 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The developmental neurotoxicity  test shall be completed and the final report submitted to EPA within 15  months of EPA's notification of the test sponsor by certified letter or  Federal Register notice under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section that  the testing shall be initiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Progress reports shall be submitted to EPA every 6 months,  beginning 6 months after the date of notification that the testing shall  be initiated, until submission of the final report to EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pharmacokinetics--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required testing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pharmacokinetics  testing of DGBE and DGBA will be conducted in rats by the dermal route  of administration in accordance with Sec. 795.225 of this chapter,  except for the provisions in paragraphs (b) (1)(ii) and (3)(i) of Sec.  795.225.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Animals. Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats shall be  used. The rats shall be 7 to 8 weeks old and weigh 180 to 220 grams.  Prior to testing, the animals shall be selected at random for each  group. Animals showing signs of ill health shall not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iv)</em> of Sec. 795.225 shall be  determined at 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing, and if  necessary, daily thereafter until at least 90 percent of the dose has  been excreted or until 7 days after dosing (whichever occurs first).  Four animals per sex per dose group shall be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The pharmacokinetics tests shall be  completed and the final reports submitted to EPA within 8 months of the  effective date of the final amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A progress report shall be submitted to EPA 6 months from the  effective date of the final amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> References.
