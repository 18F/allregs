                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General of the  United States issued regulations for collecting debts owed the United  States under the authority contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(d)(2). The  regulations in this part prescribe standards for the General Services  Administration (GSA) use in the administrative collection, offset,  compromise, and the suspension or termination of collection activity for  civil claims for money, funds, or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C.  3701(b), unless specific GSA statutes or regulations apply to such  activities or, as provided for by Title 11 of the United States Code,  when the claims involve bankruptcy. The regulations in this part also  prescribe standards for referring debts to the Department of Justice for  litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office of Management  and Budget's Circular A-129 (Revised), ``Policies for Federal Credit  Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,'' the Department of the Treasury's  ``Managing Federal Receivables,'' and other publications concerning debt  collection and debt management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> GSA is not limited to the remedies contained in this part and  will use all authorized remedies, including alternative dispute  resolution and arbitration, to collect civil claims, to the extent such  remedies are not inconsistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act, as  amended, Chapter 37 of Title 31, United States Code; the Debt Collection  Act of 1982, 5 U.S.C. 5514; the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996,  31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq., or other relevant statutes. The regulations in  this part are not intended to impair GSA's common law rights to collect  debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards and policies regarding the classification of debt for  accounting purposes (for example, write off of uncollectible debt) are  contained in the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-129  (Revised), ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax  Receivables.''</p>
