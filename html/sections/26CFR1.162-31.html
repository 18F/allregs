                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth rules regarding the deduction limitation under section 162(m)(6), which provides that a covered health insurance provider's deduction for applicable individual remuneration (AIR) and deferred deduction remuneration (DDR) attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year is limited to $500,000. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth definitions of the terms used in this section. Paragraph (c) of this section explains the general limitation on deductions under section 162(m)(6). Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the methods that must be used to attribute AIR and DDR to services performed in one or more taxable years of a covered health insurance provider. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth rules on how the deduction limit applies to AIR and DDR that is otherwise deductible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) but for the deduction limitation under section 162(m)(6) (referred to in this section as remuneration that is otherwise deductible). Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth additional rules for persons participating in certain corporate transactions. Paragraph (g) of this section explains the interaction of section 162(m)(6) with sections 162(m)(1) and 280G. Paragraph (h) of this section sets forth rules for determining the amounts of remuneration that are not subject to the deduction limitation under section 162(m)(6) due to the statutory effective date (referred to in this section as grandfathered amounts). Paragraph (i) of this section sets forth transition rules for DDR that is attributable to services performed in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2013. Paragraph (j) of this section sets forth the effective and applicability dates of the rules in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Health insurance issuer. For purposes of this section, a health insurance issuer is a health insurance issuer as defined in section 9832(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Health insurance issuer. For purposes of this section, a health insurance issuer is a health insurance issuer as defined in section 9832(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aggregated group. For purposes of this section, an aggregated group is a health insurance issuer and each other person that is treated as a single employer with the health insurance issuer at any time during the taxable year of the health insurance issuer under sections 414(b) (controlled groups of corporations), 414(c) (partnerships, proprietorships, etc. under common control), 414(m) (affiliated service groups), or 414(o), except that the rules in section 1563(a)(2) and (3) (with respect to corporations) and Sec. 1.414(c)-2(c) and (d) (with respect to trades or businesses under common control) for brother-sister groups and combined groups are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parent entity--(i) In general.

For purposes of this section, a parent entity is either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 414(b)) or a parent-subsidiary group of trades or businesses under common control (within the meaning of section 414(c)) that includes a health insurance issuer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> the health insurance issuer in an aggregated group that is an affiliated service group (within the meaning of section 414(m)) or a group described in section 414(o).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain aggregated groups with multiple health insurance issuers--(A) In general. If two or more health insurance issuers are members of an aggregated group that is an affiliated service group (within the meaning of section 414(m)) or group described in section 414(o), the parent entity is the health insurance issuer in the aggregated group that is designated in writing by the other members of the aggregated group to act as the parent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If two or more health insurance issuers are members of an aggregated group that is an affiliated service group (within the meaning of section 414(m)) or group described in section 414(o), the parent entity is the health insurance issuer in the aggregated group that is designated in writing by the other members of the aggregated group to act as the parent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Successor parent entities. If a health insurance issuer that is the parent entity of an aggregated group pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section (a predecessor parent entity) ceases to be a member of the aggregated group (for example, as a result of a corporate transaction) and, after the predecessor parent entity ceases to be a member of the aggregated group, two or more health insurance issuers are members of the aggregated group, the

new parent entity (the successor parent entity) is another member of the aggregated group designated in writing by the remaining members of the aggregated group. The successor parent entity must be a health insurance issuer in the aggregated group that has the same taxable year as the predecessor parent entity; provided, however, that if no health insurance issuer in the aggregated group has the same taxable year as the predecessor parent entity, the members of the aggregated group may designate in writing any other health insurance issuer in the aggregated group to be the parent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Failure to designate a parent entity. If the members of an aggregated group that includes two or more health insurance issuers and that is an affiliated service group (within the meaning of section 414(m)) or a group described in section 414(o) fail to designate in writing a health insurance issuer to act as the parent entity of the aggregated group, the parent entity of the aggregated group for all taxable years is deemed to be an entity with a taxable year that is the calendar year (without regard to whether the aggregated group includes or has ever included an entity with a calendar year taxable year) for all purposes under this section for which a parent entity's taxable year is relevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Covered health insurance provider--(i) In general. For purposes of this section and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(4), a covered health insurance provider is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(4), a covered health insurance provider is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A health insurance issuer for any of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012 in which at least 25 percent of the gross premiums it receives from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) are from providing minimum essential coverage (as defined in section 5000A(f)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> a health insurance issuer for any of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2013 in which it receives premiums from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> the parent entity of an aggregated group of which one or more health insurance issuers described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section are members for the taxable year of the parent entity with which, or in which, ends the taxable year of any such health insurance issuer; however, if the parent entity of an aggregated group is a health insurance issuer described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, that health insurance issuer is a covered health insurance provider for any taxable year that it is otherwise a covered health insurance provider, without regard to whether the taxable year of any other health insurance issuer described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section ends with or within its taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> each other member of an aggregated group of which one or more health insurance issuers described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section are members for the taxable year of the other member ending with, or within, the parent entity's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Parent entities with short taxable years. If for any reason a parent entity has a taxable year that is less than 12 months (for example, because the taxable year of a predecessor parent entity ends when it ceases to be a member of an aggregated group), then, for purposes of determining whether the parent entity and each other member of the aggregated group is a covered health insurance provider with respect to the parent entity's short taxable year (that is, for purposes of determining whether the taxable year of a health insurance issuer described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section ends with or within the short taxable year of the parent entity and for purposes of determining whether another member of the aggregated group has a taxable year ending with or within the short taxable year of the parent entity), the taxable year of the parent entity is treated as the 12-month period ending on the last day of the short taxable year. Accordingly, a parent entity is a covered health insurance provider for its short taxable year if it is a health insurance issuer described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section or if the taxable year of a health insurance issuer described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section in an

aggregated group with the parent entity ends with or within the 12-month period ending on the last day of the parent entity's short taxable year. Similarly, each other member of the parent entity's aggregated group is a covered health insurance provider for its taxable year ending with or within the 12-month period ending on the last day of the parent entity's short taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Predecessor and successor parent entities. If the parent entity of an aggregated group changes, the members of the aggregated group may be covered health insurance providers based on their relationship to either or both parent entities with respect to the taxable years of the parent entities in which the change occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Self-insured plans. For purposes of this section, a person is not a covered health insurance provider solely because it maintains a self-insured medical reimbursement plan. For this purpose, a self-insured medical reimbursement plan is a separate written plan for the benefit of employees (including former employees) that provides for reimbursement of medical expenses referred to in section 105(b) and does not provide for reimbursement under an individual or group policy of accident or health insurance issued by a licensed insurance company or under an arrangement in the nature of a prepaid health care plan that is regulated under federal or state law in a manner similar to the regulation of insurance companies, and may include a plan maintained by an employee organization described in section 501(c)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> De minimis exception--(A) In general. A health insurance issuer and any member of its aggregated group that would otherwise be a covered health insurance provider under paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2012 is not a covered health insurance provider under this section for that taxable year if the premiums received by the health insurance issuer and any other health insurance issuers in its aggregated group from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) that constitutes minimum essential coverage (as defined in section 5000A(f)) are less than two percent of the gross revenues of the health insurance issuer and all other members of its aggregated group for that taxable year. A health insurance issuer and any member of its aggregated group that would otherwise be a covered health insurance provider under paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2013 is not a covered health insurance provider for purposes of this section for that taxable year if the premiums received by the health insurance issuer and any other health insurance issuers in its aggregated group from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) are less than two percent of the gross revenues of the health insurance issuer and all other members of its aggregated group for that taxable year. In determining whether premiums constitute less than two percent of gross revenues, the amount of gross revenues must be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For the definition of the term premiums, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section. A person that would be a covered health insurance provider for a taxable year in an aggregated group with a predecessor parent entity and that would also be a covered health insurance provider for that taxable year in an aggregated group with a successor parent entity is not a covered health insurance provider under the de minimis exception only if the aggregated groups of which the person is a member meet the requirements of the de minimis exception based on both the taxable year of the predecessor parent entity and the taxable year of the successor parent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A health insurance issuer and any member of its aggregated group that would otherwise be a covered health insurance provider under paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2012 is not a covered health insurance provider under this section for that taxable year if the premiums received by the health insurance issuer and any other health insurance issuers in its aggregated group from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) that constitutes minimum essential coverage (as defined in section 5000A(f)) are less than two percent of the gross revenues of the health insurance issuer and all other members of its aggregated group for that taxable year. A health insurance issuer and any member of its aggregated group that would otherwise be a covered health insurance provider under paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2013 is not a covered health insurance provider for purposes of this section for that taxable year if the premiums received by the health insurance issuer and any other health insurance issuers in its aggregated group from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) are less than two percent of the gross revenues of the health insurance issuer and all other members of its aggregated group for that taxable year. In determining whether premiums constitute less than two percent of gross revenues, the amount of gross revenues must be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For the definition of the term premiums, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section. A person that would be a covered health insurance provider for a taxable year in an aggregated group with a predecessor parent entity and that would also be a covered health insurance provider for that taxable year in an aggregated group with a successor parent entity is not a covered health insurance provider under the de minimis exception only if the aggregated groups of which the person is a member meet the requirements of the de minimis exception based on both the taxable year of the predecessor parent entity and the taxable year of the successor parent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One-year de minimis exception transition period. If a health insurance issuer or a member of an aggregated group is not a covered health insurance provider for a taxable year solely by reason of the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, but fails to meet the requirements of the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section for the immediately following taxable year, that health insurance issuer or member of an aggregated

group will not be a covered health insurance provider for that immediately following taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b)(4). For purposes of these examples, each corporation has a taxable year that is the calendar year, unless the example provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporations Y and Z are members of an aggregated group under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Y is a health insurance issuer that is a covered health insurance provider pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section and receives premiums from providing health insurance coverage that is minimum essential coverage during its 2015 taxable year in an amount that is less than two percent of the combined gross revenues of Y and Z for their 2015 taxable years. Z is not a health insurance issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Y and Z are not covered health insurance providers under paragraph (b)(4) of this section for their 2015 taxable years because they meet the requirements of the de minimis exception under paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporations V, W, and X are members of an aggregated group under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. V is a health insurance issuer that is a covered health insurance provider pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, but neither W nor X is a health insurance issuer. W is the parent entity of the aggregated group. V's taxable year ends on December 31, W's taxable year ends on June 30, and X's taxable year ends on September 30. For its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, V receives $3x of premiums from providing minimum essential coverage and has no other revenue. For its taxable year ending June 30, 2017, W has $100x in gross revenue. For its taxable year ending September 30, 2016, X has $60x in gross revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> But for the de minimis exception, V (the health insurance issuer) would be a covered health insurance provider for its taxable year ending December 31, 2016; W (the parent entity) would be a covered health insurance provider for its taxable year ending June 30, 2017 (its taxable year with which, or within which, ends the taxable year of the health insurance issuer); and X (the other member of the aggregated group) would be a covered health insurance provider for its taxable year ending on September 30, 2016 (its taxable year ending with, or within, the taxable year of the parent entity). However, the premiums received by V (the health insurance issuer) from providing minimum essential coverage during the taxable year that it would otherwise be a covered health insurance provider under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section are less than two percent of the combined gross revenues of V, W, and X for the related taxable years that they would otherwise be covered health insurance providers under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section ($3x is less than $3.26x (two percent of $163x)). Therefore, the de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section applies, and V, W, and X are not covered health insurance providers for these taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 2, except that V receives $4x of premiums for providing minimum essential coverage for its taxable year ending December 31, 2016. In addition, the members of the VWX aggregated group were not covered health insurance providers for their taxable years ending December 31, 2015, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively (their immediately preceding taxable years) solely by reason of the de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the premiums received by the members of the aggregated group from providing minimum essential coverage are more than two percent of the gross revenues of the aggregated group for the taxable years during which the members would otherwise be treated as covered health insurance providers under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section ($4x is greater than $3.28x (two percent of $164x)), they were not covered health insurance providers for their immediately preceding taxable years solely because of the de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section. Therefore, V, W, and X are not covered health insurance providers for their taxable years ending on December 31, 2016, June 30, 2017, and September 30, 2016, respectively, because of the one-year transition period under paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) of this section. However, the members of the VWX aggregated group will be covered health insurance providers for their subsequent taxable years if they would otherwise be covered health insurance providers for those taxable years under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporations W, X, Y, and Z are members of a controlled group described in section 414(b)) that is an aggregated group under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. W and X are health insurance issuers. Y and Z are not health insurance issuers. W is the parent entity of the aggregated group. W's and Y's taxable years end on December 31; X's taxable year ends on March 31; and Z's taxable year ends on June 30. As a result of a corporate transaction, W is no longer a member of the WXYZ aggregated group as of September 30, 2016, and W's taxable year ends on that date. Following the corporate transaction, X becomes the parent entity of the XYZ aggregated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because W's taxable year is treated as the 12-month period ending on September 30,

2016, W is the parent entity for X's taxable year ending March 31, 2016, Z's taxable year ending June 30, 2016, and Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2015. Because X's taxable year begins on April 1, 2016 and ends on March 31, 2017, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, X is the parent entity for Z's taxable year ending June 30, 2016, Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2016, and W's taxable year ending September 30, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 4. In addition, W receives $4x of premiums for providing minimum essential coverage and no other revenue for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2016 and ending September 30, 2016. X receives $2x of premiums for providing minimum essential coverage and has no other revenue for its taxable year ending March 31, 2016. X receives $1x of premiums for providing minimum essential coverage and no other revenue for its taxable year ending March 31, 2017. For its taxable year ending December 31, 2015, Y has $100x in gross revenue. For its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, Y has $200x in gross revenue. For its taxable year ending June 30, 2016, Z has $120x in gross revenue (none of which constitute premiums for providing health insurance coverage that constitutes minimum essential coverage (as defined in section 5000A(f)). W, X, Y, and Z did not qualify for the de minimis exception in any prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For its taxable year ending June 30, 2016, Z does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A). Even though Z meets the requirements for the de minimis exception with respect to the taxable year of parent entity X ending March 31, 2017 ($5x is less than two percent of $325x), Z does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception based on the premiums and gross revenues of the taxable years of its aggregated group members ending with or within the deemed 12-month taxable year of parent entity W ending September 30, 2016 ($6x is more than two percent of $226x). Therefore, Z is a covered health insurance provider for its June 30, 2016 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For its taxable year ending December 31, 2015, Y does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) ($6x is more than two percent of $226x). For its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, Y meets the requirements for the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) ($5x is less than two percent of $325x). Therefore, Y is a covered health insurance provider for its December 31, 2015 taxable year, but is not a covered health insurance provider for its December 31, 2016 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For its taxable year ending September 30, 2016, W does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A). Even though W meets the requirements for the de minimis exception with respect to X's taxable year ending March 31, 2017 ($5x is less than two percent of $325x), W does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception with respect its taxable year ending September 30, 2016 ($6x is more than two percent of $226x). Therefore, W is a covered health insurance provider for its September 30, 2016 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For its taxable year ending March 31, 2016, X does not meet the requirements for the de minimis exception ($6x is more than two percent of $226x). For its taxable year ending March, 31 2017, X meets the requirements for the de minimis exception ($5x is less than two percent of $325x). Therefore, X is a covered health insurance provider for its March 31, 2016 taxable year, but is not a covered health insurance provider for its March 31, 2017 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Premiums--(i) For purposes of this section, the term premiums means premiums written (including premiums written for assumption reinsurance, but reduced by assumption reinsurance ceded (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section), excluding indemnity reinsurance written (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section) and direct service payments (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section), but without reduction for ceding commissions or medical loss ratio rebates, determined in a manner consistent with the requirements for reporting under the Supplemental Health Care Exhibit published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the MLR Annual Reporting Form filed with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (or any successor or replacement exhibits or forms).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section, the term premiums means premiums written (including premiums written for assumption reinsurance, but reduced by assumption reinsurance ceded (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section), excluding indemnity reinsurance written (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section) and direct service payments (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section), but without reduction for ceding commissions or medical loss ratio rebates, determined in a manner consistent with the requirements for reporting under the Supplemental Health Care Exhibit published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the MLR Annual Reporting Form filed with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (or any successor or replacement exhibits or forms).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assumption reinsurance.

For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), the term indemnity reinsurance means reinsurance provided pursuant to an agreement between a health insurance issuer and a reinsuring company under which the reinsuring company agrees to indemnify the health insurance issuer for all or part of the risk of loss under

policies specified in the agreement, and the health insurance issuer retains its liability to provide health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) to, and its contractual relationship with, the insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Direct service payments. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), the term direct service payment means a capitated, prepaid, periodic, or other payment made by a health insurance issuer or another entity that receives premiums from providing health insurance coverage (as defined in section 9832(b)(1)) to another organization as compensation for providing, managing, or arranging for the provision of healthcare services by physicians, hospitals, or other healthcare providers, regardless of whether the organization that receives the compensation is subject to healthcare provider, health insurance, health plan licensing, financial solvency, or other similar regulatory requirements under state insurance law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disqualified taxable year.

For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, the term remuneration has the same meaning as the term applicable employee remuneration, as defined in section 162(m)(4), but without regard to the exceptions under section 162(m)(4)(B) (remuneration payable on a commission basis), section 162(m)(4)(C) (performance-based compensation), and section 162(m)(4)(D) (existing binding contracts), and the regulations under those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

For purposes of this section, the term applicable individual remuneration or AIR means, with respect to any applicable individual for any disqualified taxable year, the aggregate amount allowable as a deduction under this chapter for that taxable year (determined without regard to section 162(m)) for remuneration for services performed by that applicable individual (whether or not in that taxable year). AIR does not include any DDR with respect to services performed during any taxable year. AIR for a disqualified taxable year may include remuneration for services performed in a taxable year before the taxable year in which the deduction for the remuneration is allowable. For example, a discretionary bonus granted and paid to an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year in recognition of services performed in prior taxable years is AIR for the disqualified taxable year in which the bonus is granted and paid. In addition, a grant of restricted stock in a disqualified taxable year with respect to which an applicable individual makes an election under section 83(b) is AIR for the disqualified taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in which the grant of the restricted stock is made. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for certain remuneration that is not treated as AIR for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Deferred Deduction Remuneration or DDR. For purposes of this section, the term deferred deduction remuneration or DDR means remuneration that would be AIR for services performed in a disqualified taxable year but for the fact that the deduction (determined without regard to section 162(m)(6)) for the remuneration is allowable in a subsequent taxable year. Whether remuneration is DDR is determined without regard to when the remuneration is paid, except to the extent that the timing of the payment affects the taxable year in which the remuneration is otherwise deductible. For example, payments that are otherwise deductible by a covered health insurance provider in an initial taxable year, but are paid to an applicable individual by the 15th day of the third month of the immediately subsequent taxable year of the covered health insurance provider (as described in Sec. 1.404(b)-1T, Q&A-2;(b)(1)), are AIR for the initial taxable year (and not DDR) because the deduction for the payments is allowable in the initial taxable year, and not a subsequent taxable year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section (regarding transition rules for certain DDR attributable to services performed in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013), DDR that is attributable to services performed in a disqualified taxable year of a covered health insurance provider is subject to the section 162(m)(6) deduction limitation even if the taxable year in which the remuneration is otherwise deductible is not a disqualified taxable year. Similarly, DDR is subject to the section 162(m)(6) deduction limitation regardless of whether an applicable individual is a service provider of the covered health insurance provider in the taxable year in which the DDR is otherwise deductible. However, remuneration that is attributable to services performed in a taxable year that is not a disqualified taxable year is not DDR even if the remuneration is otherwise deductible in a disqualified taxable year. See also paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for certain remuneration that is not treated as DDR for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of this section, the term substantial risk of forfeiture has the same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.409A-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> In-service payment. An in-service payment is any amount that is paid with respect to an applicable individual from an account balance plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) or a nonaccount balance plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C) in a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider during which at any time the applicable individual is a service provider (including amounts that became otherwise deductible, but were not paid, in a previous taxable year of a covered health insurance provider). Amounts that are paid in the last year that an applicable individual is a service provider (for example, amounts paid at separation from service) are in-service payments if the applicable individual is a service provider at any time during the taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in which the payment is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Payment year.

Paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) through (v) of this section, and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, set forth rules of general applicability for attributing remuneration to services performed by an applicable individual in a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider. Paragraph (d)(3) sets forth two methods for attributing remuneration provided under an account balance plan--the account balance ratio method (described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) and the principal additions method (described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section). Paragraph (d)(4) of this section sets forth two methods for attributing remuneration provided under a nonaccount balance plan--the present value ratio method (described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section) and the

formula benefit ratio method (described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section). Paragraph (d)(5) of this section sets forth rules for attributing remuneration resulting from equity-based remuneration (such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units). Paragraph (d)(6) of this section sets forth rules for attributing remuneration that is involuntary separation pay. Paragraph (d)(7) of this section sets forth rules for attributing remuneration that is received under a reimbursement arrangement, and paragraph (d)(8) of this section sets forth rules for attributing remuneration that results from a split-dollar life insurance arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No attribution to taxable years during which no services are performed or before a legally binding right arises--(A) In general. For purposes of this section, remuneration is not attributable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider ending before the later of the date the applicable individual begins providing services to the covered health insurance provider (or any member of its aggregated group) and the date the applicable individual obtains a legally binding right to the remuneration, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To any other taxable year of a covered health insurance provider during which the applicable individual is not a service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Attribution of remuneration before the commencement of services or a legally binding right arises. To the extent that remuneration would otherwise be attributable in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) through (11) of this section to a taxable year ending before the later of the date an applicable individual begins providing services to a covered health insurance provider (or any member of its aggregated group) and the date the applicable individual obtains a legally binding right to the remuneration, the remuneration is attributed to services performed in the taxable year in which the later of these dates occurs. For example, if an applicable individual obtains a contractual right to remuneration in a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider and the remuneration would otherwise be attributable to that taxable year pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, but the applicable individual does not begin providing services to the covered health insurance provider until the next taxable year, the remuneration is attributable to the taxable year in which the applicable individual begins providing services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Attribution to 12-month periods. To the extent that a covered health insurance provider is required to attribute remuneration on a daily pro rata basis under this paragraph (d), it may treat any 12-month period as having 365 days (and so may ignore the extra day in leap years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Remuneration subject to nonlapse restriction or similar formula. For purposes of this section, if stock or other property is subject to a nonlapse restriction (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(h)), or if the remuneration payable to an applicable individual is determined under a formula that, if applied to stock or other property, would be a nonlapse restriction, the amount of the remuneration and the attribution of that remuneration to taxable years must be determined based upon application of the nonlapse restriction or formula. For example, if the earnings or losses on an account under an account balance plan are determined based upon the performance of company stock, the valuation of which is based on a formula that if applied to the stock would be a nonlapse restriction, then that formula must be used consistently for purposes of determining the amount of the remuneration credited to that account balance in taxable years and the attribution of that remuneration to taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legally binding right. Unless attributable to services performed in a different taxable year pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3) through (11) of this section, remuneration is attributable to services performed in the taxable year of a covered health insurance provider in which an applicable individual obtains a legally binding right to the remuneration. An applicable individual does not have a legally binding right to remuneration if the remuneration may be reduced unilaterally or eliminated by a covered health insurance provider or other person after the services creating the right to the remuneration

have been performed. However, if the facts and circumstances indicate that the discretion to reduce or eliminate the remuneration is available or exercisable only upon a condition, or the discretion to reduce or eliminate the remuneration lacks substantive significance, an applicable individual will be considered to have a legally binding right to the remuneration. For this purpose, remuneration is not considered to be subject to unilateral reduction or elimination merely because it may be reduced or eliminated by operation of the objective terms of a plan, such as the application of a nondiscretionary, objective provision creating a substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Account balance plans--(i) In general. When remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider becomes otherwise deductible (for example, because the amount was paid or made available during that taxable year) from a plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) (an account balance plan), that remuneration must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in accordance with an attribution method described in either paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section. However, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(D) and (f)(3) of this section, the covered health insurance provider and all members of its aggregated group must apply the same attribution method under this paragraph (d)(3) consistently for all taxable years beginning after September 23, 2014 for all amounts that become otherwise deductible under all account balance plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. When remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider becomes otherwise deductible (for example, because the amount was paid or made available during that taxable year) from a plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) (an account balance plan), that remuneration must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in accordance with an attribution method described in either paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section. However, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(D) and (f)(3) of this section, the covered health insurance provider and all members of its aggregated group must apply the same attribution method under this paragraph (d)(3) consistently for all taxable years beginning after September 23, 2014 for all amounts that become otherwise deductible under all account balance plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Account balance ratio method--(A) In general. Under this method, remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider that becomes otherwise deductible under an account balance plan must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in each taxable year of the covered health insurance provider ending with or before the payment year during which the applicable individual was a service provider and for which the account balance of the applicable individual increased (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section). The amount attributed to each such taxable year is equal to the amount of remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the applicable individual's account balance under the plan for the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum of all such increases for all taxable years during which the applicable individual was a service provider. Thus, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under a plan is attributed to a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in proportion to the increase in the applicable individual's account balance for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Under this method, remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider that becomes otherwise deductible under an account balance plan must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in each taxable year of the covered health insurance provider ending with or before the payment year during which the applicable individual was a service provider and for which the account balance of the applicable individual increased (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section). The amount attributed to each such taxable year is equal to the amount of remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the applicable individual's account balance under the plan for the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum of all such increases for all taxable years during which the applicable individual was a service provider. Thus, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under a plan is attributed to a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in proportion to the increase in the applicable individual's account balance for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Increase in the account balance. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii), an increase in an account balance under an account balance plan occurs for a taxable year if the account balance as of the measurement date in that taxable year is greater than the account balance as of the measurement date in every earlier taxable year. In that case, the amount of the increase for that taxable year is equal to the excess of the applicable individual's account balance as of the measurement date for that taxable year over the greatest of the applicable individual's account balances under the plan as of the measurement date in every earlier taxable year. If the applicable individual's account balance as of the measurement date in a taxable year is less than or equal to the applicable individual's account balance as of the measurement date in any earlier taxable year, there is no increase in the account balance for that later taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certain account balance adjustments. For purposes of determining the account balance on a measurement date under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the account balance is adjusted as provided in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In-service payments. If an in-service payment is made from the account of an applicable individual under an account balance plan in any taxable year of a covered health insurance provider,

then the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C)(1) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solely for purposes of determining the increase in the applicable individual's account balance as of the measurement date in the payment year (and not for purposes of attributing any amount that becomes otherwise deductible in any later taxable year), the account balance as of the measurement date for that taxable year is increased by the amount of all in-service payments made from the plan during that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of attributing any amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan in any taxable year after the payment year of the in-service payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> the account balance as of the measurement date in each taxable year that ends before the taxable year to which the in-service payment is attributed pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) is reduced by the sum of the amount of the in-service payment that is attributed to that taxable year and the amount of the in-service payment that is attributed to each taxable year that ends before that taxable year, if any, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> to the extent that the in-service payment includes an amount that was deductible by the covered health insurance provider in a previous taxable year and, therefore, was previously attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in one or more taxable years of the covered health insurance provider (for example, because the amount was made available in a previous taxable year but was not paid at that time), the account balance as of the measurement date for each taxable year that ends before the taxable year to which the in-service payment is attributed pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) is reduced by the sum of the amount of the in-service payment previously attributable to that taxable year and the amount of the in-service payment previously attributable to each taxable year that ends before that taxable year, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain increases after ceasing to be a service provider. Any addition (other than income or earnings) to an account balance plan made in a taxable year that begins after an applicable individual ceases to be a service provider (and that ends before the applicable individual becomes a service provider again, if applicable) is added to the account balance of the applicable individual as of the measurement date of the first preceding taxable year in which the applicable individual was a service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Account balance adjustments for grandfathered amounts. If a covered health insurance provider uses the principal additions method for determining grandfathered amounts for an applicable individual under paragraph (h) of this section, then, for purposes of determining the increase in the applicable individual's account balance, the account balance as of any measurement date is reduced by the amount of any grandfathered amounts otherwise included in the account balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Transition rule for amounts attributed before the applicability date of the final regulations. Amounts that become otherwise deductible in taxable years beginning before September 23, 2014 may be attributed to services performed in taxable years of a covered health insurance provider under the rules set forth in the proposed regulations. If a covered health insurance provider attributes an amount paid to an applicable individual pursuant to a method permitted under the proposed regulations and then chooses to use the account balance ratio method to attribute amounts that subsequently become otherwise deductible with respect to that applicable individual, then, for purposes of applying the account balance ratio method to attribute any amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan after the taxable year in which the last payment was made that was attributed pursuant to the proposed regulations, the account balance as of the measurement date for each taxable year that ends before the taxable year in which the last payment that was attributed pursuant to the proposed regulations is reduced by the sum of the amount previously attributed to that taxable year under the proposed regulations and the amount previously attributable to each taxable year that ends prior to that taxable year under the proposed regulations, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Principal additions method--(A) In general. Under this method, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under an account balance plan during a payment year must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in the taxable year of the covered health insurance provider during which the applicable individual was a service provider and in which the principal addition to which the amount relates is credited under the plan (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section). An amount relates to a principal addition if the amount is a payment of the principal addition or earnings on the principal addition, based on a separate accounting of these amounts. The principal additions method described in this paragraph may be used to attribute amounts that become otherwise deductible under an account balance plan only if the covered health insurance provider separately accounts for each principal addition to the plan (and any earnings thereon) and traces each amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan to a principal addition made in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Under this method, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under an account balance plan during a payment year must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in the taxable year of the covered health insurance provider during which the applicable individual was a service provider and in which the principal addition to which the amount relates is credited under the plan (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section). An amount relates to a principal addition if the amount is a payment of the principal addition or earnings on the principal addition, based on a separate accounting of these amounts. The principal additions method described in this paragraph may be used to attribute amounts that become otherwise deductible under an account balance plan only if the covered health insurance provider separately accounts for each principal addition to the plan (and any earnings thereon) and traces each amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan to a principal addition made in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Principal addition--(1) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii), the excess (if any) of the sum of the account balance of an applicable individual in an account balance plan as of the last day of a taxable year and any payments made during the taxable year over the account balance as of the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year, that is not due to earnings or losses (as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section), is treated as a principal addition that is credited to the plan in that taxable year if the applicable individual was a service provider during that taxable year. If the applicable individual was not a service provider during that taxable year, the excess described in the preceding sentence is treated as a principal addition that is credited to the plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Principal additions after termination of employment. Any principal addition to an account balance plan made in a taxable year that begins after an applicable individual ceases to be a service provider (and that ends before the applicable individual becomes a service provider again, if applicable) is treated as a principal addition that is credited in the first preceding taxable year in which the applicable individual was a service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Earnings. Whether remuneration constitutes earnings on a principal addition is determined under the principles defining income attributable to an amount taken into account under Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2). Therefore, for an account balance plan, earnings on an amount deferred generally include an amount credited on behalf of an applicable individual under the terms of the arrangement that reflects a rate of return that does not exceed either the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment (as defined in Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(B)), or, if the income does not reflect the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment, a rate of return that reflects a reasonable rate of interest (as defined in Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(C)). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii), the use of a rate of return that is not based on a predetermined actual investment or a reasonable rate of interest generally will result in the treatment of some or all of the remuneration as a principal addition that is attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider in accordance with this paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nonaccount balance plans--(i) In general. When remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider becomes otherwise deductible under a plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C) (a nonaccount balance plan), that remuneration must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in accordance with the attribution method described in either paragraph (d)(4)(ii) or (d)(4)(iii) of this section. However, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(D) and (d)(4)(iii)(D) and (f)(3) of this section, the covered health insurance provider and all members of its aggregated group must apply the same attribution method under

this paragraph (d)(4) consistently for all taxable years beginning after September 23, 2014 for all amounts that become deductible under all nonaccount balance plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. When remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider becomes otherwise deductible under a plan described in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C) (a nonaccount balance plan), that remuneration must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in accordance with the attribution method described in either paragraph (d)(4)(ii) or (d)(4)(iii) of this section. However, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(D) and (d)(4)(iii)(D) and (f)(3) of this section, the covered health insurance provider and all members of its aggregated group must apply the same attribution method under

Under this method, remuneration for services performed by an applicable individual for a covered health insurance provider that becomes otherwise deductible under a nonaccount balance plan must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in each taxable year of the covered health insurance provider ending with or before the payment year during which the applicable individual was a service provider for which the present value of the future payment(s) to be made to or on behalf of the applicable individual under the plan increased (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section). The amount attributed to each such taxable year is equal to the amount of remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the present value of the future payment(s) to which the applicable individual has a legally binding right under the plan for the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum of all such increases for all taxable years during which the applicable individual was a service provider.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii), for a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider, an increase in the present value of the future payment(s) to which an applicable individual has a legally binding right under a nonaccount balance plan occurs if the present value of the future payment(s) as of the measurement date in the taxable year is greater than the present value of the future payment(s) as of the measurement date in every earlier taxable year. In that case, the amount of the increase for that taxable year is equal to the excess of the present value of the future payment(s) to which the applicable individual has a legally binding right under the plan as of the measurement date for that taxable year over the greatest present value of the future payment(s) to which the applicable individual had a legally binding right under the plan as of the measurement date in every earlier taxable year. If the present value of the future payment(s) as of a measurement date in a taxable year is less than or equal to the present value of the future payment(s) as of the measurement date in any earlier taxable year, then there is no increase in the present value of the future payment(s) to which the applicable individual has a legally binding right under the plan for that later taxable year. For purposes of determining the increase (or decrease) in the present value of a future payment(s) under a nonaccount balance plan, the rules of Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(c)(2) apply (including the requirement that reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods be used).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certain present value adjustments. For purposes of determining the present value of the future payment(s) to which an applicable individual has a legally binding right to receive as of a measurement date under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the present value is adjusted as provided in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In-service payments.

Amounts that become otherwise deductible in taxable years beginning before September 23, 2014 may be attributed under the rules set forth in the proposed regulations. If a covered health insurance provider attributes an amount paid to an applicable individual pursuant to the proposed regulations and then chooses to use the present value ratio method to attribute amounts that subsequently become otherwise deductible with respect to that applicable individual, then, for purposes of applying the present value ratio method to attribute any amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan in any taxable year after the taxable year in which the last payment was made that was attributed pursuant to the proposed regulations, the present value of the future payment(s) as of the measurement date for each taxable year that ends before the taxable year in which the last payment that was attributed pursuant to the proposed regulations is reduced by the present value of each future payment to which the applicable individual had a legally binding right to be paid that was attributed pursuant to the proposed regulations (determined as of the measurement date based upon all of the applicable factors under the plan as of the measurement date, such as compensation and years of service on that date), with no adjustment for an amount that became otherwise deductible, but was not paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Formula benefit ratio method--(A) In general.

The amount attributed to each such taxable year is equal to the amount of remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan on the date of payment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the applicable individual's formula benefit under the plan for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the sum of all such increases for all taxable years during which the applicable individual was a service provider (which will generally be the amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan on the date of payment). Thus, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under a plan is attributed to a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in proportion to the increase in the applicable individual's formula benefit under the plan in that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Under this method, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under a nonaccount balance plan on a date (referred to for these purposes as the date of payment) must be attributed to services performed by the applicable individual in each taxable year of the covered health insurance provider ending with or before the payment year during which the applicable individual was a service provider and for which the formula benefit of the applicable individual under the plan increased (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B), (C) and (D) of this section). The amount attributed to each such taxable year is equal to the amount of remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan on the date of payment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the applicable individual's formula benefit under the plan for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the sum of all such increases for all taxable years during which the applicable individual was a service provider (which will generally be the amount that becomes otherwise deductible under the plan on the date of payment). Thus, remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible under a plan is attributed to a taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in proportion to the increase in the applicable individual's formula benefit under the plan in that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Formula benefit. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(iii), an applicable

individual's formula benefit as of any date is the benefit (or portion thereof) to which the applicable individual has a legally binding right under a nonaccount balance plan as of that date determined based upon all of the applicable factors under the plan (for example, compensation and years of service as of that date), disregarding any substantial risk of forfeiture and assuming that the applicable individual meets any applicable eligibility requirements for the benefit as of that date. For this purpose, the formula benefit is expressed in the form that it has become otherwise deductible. For example, if an applicable individual's benefit under a plan is paid in the form of a single lump sum, then the applicable individual's formula benefit under the plan is expressed in the form of a single lump sum for all purposes under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii). If the amount that becomes otherwise deductible is payable in more than one form of payment (for example, 50 percent of the benefit is paid in the form of a lump sum and 50 percent is paid in the form of a life annuity), then each separate form of payment is treated as a separate formula benefit to which this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) is applied separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Increase in formula benefit. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(iii), an increase in an applicable individual's formula benefit under a nonaccount balance plan occurs for a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider if the formula benefit as of the measurement date in that taxable year is greater than the formula benefit as of the measurement date in every earlier taxable year. In that case, the amount of the increase for that taxable year is equal to excess of the formula benefit as of the measurement date in that taxable year over the greatest formula benefit as of any measurement date in any earlier taxable year. If the applicable individual's formula benefit as of a measurement date in a taxable year is less than or equal to the applicable individual's formula benefit as of the measurement date in any earlier taxable year, there is no increase in the formula benefit to which the applicable individual has a legally binding right under the plan for that later taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Certain adjustments.

Solely for purposes of attributing a payment under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) (including an in-service payment), the date of payment is substituted for the measurement date in the payment year to determine whether an increase in the formula benefit occurs in the payment year and the amount of any such increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts not paid. If an amount becomes otherwise deductible under a nonaccount balance plan, but is not paid, the formula benefit for that amount must be determined using the form in which it will be paid, if that form is known, or any form in which it may be paid, if the actual form of payment is unknown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Increases in the formula benefit after ceasing to be a service provider. Any increase in the formula benefit with respect to an applicable individual resulting from a legally binding right arising in a taxable year that begins after the applicable individual ceases to be a service provider (and that ends before the applicable individual becomes a service provider again, if applicable) is added to the formula benefit with respect to the applicable individual as of the measurement date of the first preceding taxable year in which the applicable individual was a service provider. However, any increase in the formula benefit resulting from a legally binding right arising in a taxable year that begins before the applicable individual ceases to be a service provider is added to the formula benefit with respect to the applicable individual as of the measurement date of the taxable year in which the legally binding right arises, even if the increase is not reflected until after the applicable individual ceases to be a service provider (such as in the case of a cost of living adjustment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Equity-based remuneration--(i) Stock options and stock appreciation rights--(A) In general.

Alternatively, the covered health insurance provider may attribute involuntary separation pay to services performed by an applicable individual on a daily pro rata basis beginning on the date that the applicable individual obtains a legally binding right to the involuntary separation pay and ending on the date of the involuntary separation from service. Involuntary separation pay to different individuals may be attributed using different methods; however, if involuntary separation payments are made to the same individual over multiple taxable years, all the payments must be attributed using the same method. For purposes of this section, the term involuntary separation pay means remuneration to which an applicable individual has a right to payment solely as a result of the individual's involuntary separation from service (within the meaning of Sec. 1.409A-1(n)). To the extent that involuntary separation pay is attributed to services performed in two or more taxable years of a covered health insurance provider as permitted under this paragraph, any amount of involuntary separation pay that is paid or made available must be attributed to services performed in all of those taxable years in the same proportion that the

total involuntary separation pay is attributed to taxable years of the covered health insurance provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reimbursements. Remuneration that is provided in the form of a reimbursement or benefit provided in-kind (other than cash) is attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in the taxable year of a covered health insurance provider in which the applicable individual makes a payment for which the applicable individual has a right to reimbursement or receives an in-kind benefit, except that remuneration provided in the form of a reimbursement or in-kind benefit during a taxable year of a covered health insurance provider in which an applicable individual is not a service provider is attributable to services performed in the most recent preceding taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in which the applicable individual is a service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Split-dollar life insurance.

Split-dollar life insurance arrangements under which payments are treated as split-dollar loans under Sec. 1.7872-15 generally will not give rise to DDR within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section, although they may give rise to AIR.

Z credits $10,000 to J under the plan on January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2018. Earnings under the terms of the plan are based on a predetermined actual investment (as defined in Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(e)(2)(i)(B)), which results in J's account balance increasing by five percent in the 2016 taxable year, decreasing by five percent in the 2017 taxable year, and increasing again by five percent in the 2018 taxable year.

N's account balance for 2017 is treated as $100,000 ($90,000 + $10,000 payment on September 30, 2017), but, because the account balance of $100,000 is less than the account balance in an earlier year, the increase in N's account balance for 2017 is zero.

On December 31, 2016, H has an involuntary separation from service.

Alternatively, involuntary separation pay may be attributed to services performed by H on a daily pro rata basis beginning on the date H

obtains a legally binding right to the involuntary separation pay and ending on the date of the involuntary separation from service. The entire $300,000 amount, including both $150,000 payments, must be attributed using the same method. Therefore, the entire $300,000 amount (comprised of two $150,000 payments) may be attributed to services performed by H in S's 2016 taxable year, which is the taxable year in which the involuntary separation from service occurs. Alternatively, each $150,000 payment may be attributed on a daily pro rata basis to the period beginning on January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2016, so that $410.96 (($150,000 x 2)/(365 x 2)) is attributed to each day of S's 2015 and 2016 taxable years. Accordingly, $150,000 is attributed to services performed by H in each of S's 2015 and 2016 taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> I is an applicable individual of corporation R.

If remuneration is attributable in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) (legally binding right), (d)(3) (account balance plan), or (d)(4) (nonaccount balance plan) of this section to services performed in a period that includes two or more taxable years of a covered health insurance provider during which the remuneration is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, that remuneration must be attributed using a two-step process. First, the remuneration must be attributed to the taxable years of the covered health insurance provider in accordance with paragraph (d)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, as applicable. Second, the remuneration attributed to the period during which the remuneration is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (the vesting period) must be reattributed on a daily pro rata basis over that period beginning on the date that the applicable individual obtains a legally binding right to the remuneration and ending on the date that the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. If a vesting period begins on a day other than the first day of a covered health insurance provider's taxable year or ends on a day other than the last day of the covered health insurance provider's taxable year, the remuneration attributable to that taxable year under the first step of the attribution process is divided between the portion of the taxable year that includes the vesting period and the portion of the taxable year that does not include the vesting period. The amount attributed to the portion of the taxable year that includes the vesting period is equal to the total amount of remuneration that would be attributable to the taxable year under the first step of the attribution process, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year that the amount is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and the denominator of which is the number of days in such taxable year. The remaining amount is attributed to the portion of the taxable year that does not include the vesting period and, therefore, is not reattributed under the second step of the attribution process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (d)(10) of this section. For purposes of this example, the corporation has a taxable year that is the calendar year and is a covered health insurance provider for all relevant taxable years, DDR is otherwise deductible in the taxable year in which it is paid, and amounts payable under nonaccount balance plans are not forfeitable upon the death of the applicable individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> J is an applicable individual of corporation Q for all relevant taxable years.

Under the terms of the plan, Q will pay J's account balance on January 1, 2021, but only if J continues to provide substantial services to Q through December 31, 2018 (so that the amount credited to J's account is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture through that date). Q credits $10,000 to J's account annually for five years on January 1 of each year beginning on January 1, 2016. The account earns interest at a fixed rate of five percent per year, compounded annually,

which solely for the purposes of this example, is assumed to be a reasonable rate of interest. Q attributes increases in account balances under the plan using the principal additions method described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Earnings on a principal addition are attributed to the same disqualified taxable year of Q to which the principal addition is attributed; therefore, the amount initially attributable to Q's 2016 taxable year is $12,763 (the $10,000 principal addition in 2016 at five percent interest for five years); the amount initially attributable to Q's 2017 taxable year is $12,155 (the $10,000 principal addition in 2017 at five percent interest for four years); the amount initially attributable to Q's 2018 taxable year is $11,576 (the $10,000 principal addition in 2018 at five percent interest for three years); the amount attributable to Q's 2019 taxable year is $11,025 (the $10,000 principal addition in 2019 at five percent interest for two years); and the amount attributable to Q's 2020 taxable year is $10,500 (the $10,000 principal addition in 2020 at five percent interest for one year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Remuneration that is attributable to two or more taxable years of Q during which it is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture must be reattributed on a daily pro rata basis to the period beginning on the date that J obtains a legally binding right to the remuneration and ending on the date that the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. Therefore, $36,494 ($12,763 + $12,155 + $11,576) is reattributed on a daily pro rata basis over the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2018.

The $500,000 deduction limitation is applied to the aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year. The aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year that exceeds the $500,000 deduction limit is not allowed as a deduction in any taxable year. Therefore, for example, if an applicable individual has more than $500,000 of AIR attributable to services performed for a covered health insurance provider in a disqualified taxable year, the amount of that AIR that exceeds $500,000 is not deductible in any taxable year, and no DDR attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in that disqualified taxable year is deductible in any taxable year. However, if an applicable individual has AIR for a disqualified taxable year that is $500,000 or less and DDR attributable to services performed in the same disqualified taxable year that, when combined with the AIR for the year, exceeds $500,000, all of the AIR is deductible in that disqualified taxable year, but the amount of DDR attributable to that taxable year that is deductible in future taxable years is limited to an amount equal to $500,000 less the amount of the AIR for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application to aggregate amounts. The $500,000 deduction limitation is applied to the aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year. The aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year that exceeds the $500,000 deduction limit is not allowed as a deduction in any taxable year. Therefore, for example, if an applicable individual has more than $500,000 of AIR attributable to services performed for a covered health insurance provider in a disqualified taxable year, the amount of that AIR that exceeds $500,000 is not deductible in any taxable year, and no DDR attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in that disqualified taxable year is deductible in any taxable year. However, if an applicable individual has AIR for a disqualified taxable year that is $500,000 or less and DDR attributable to services performed in the same disqualified taxable year that, when combined with the AIR for the year, exceeds $500,000, all of the AIR is deductible in that disqualified taxable year, but the amount of DDR attributable to that taxable year that is deductible in future taxable years is limited to an amount equal to $500,000 less the amount of the AIR for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Order of application and calculation of deduction limitation--(i) In general. The deduction limitation with respect to any applicable individual for any disqualified taxable year is applied to AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by that applicable individual in that disqualified taxable year at the time that the remuneration becomes otherwise deductible, and each time the deduction limitation is applied to an amount that is otherwise deductible, the deduction limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount against which it is applied. Accordingly, the deduction limitation is applied first to an applicable individual's AIR attributable to services performed in a disqualified taxable year and is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the AIR to which the deduction limit is applied. If the applicable individual also has an amount of DDR attributable to services performed in that disqualified taxable year that becomes otherwise deductible in a subsequent taxable year, the deduction limit, as reduced, is applied to that amount of DDR in the first taxable in which the DDR becomes otherwise deductible. The deduction limit is then further reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the DDR to which the deduction limit is applied. If the applicable individual has an additional amount of DDR attributable to services performed in the original disqualified taxable year that becomes otherwise deductible in a subsequent taxable year, the deduction limit, as further reduced, is applied to that amount of DDR in the taxable year in which it is otherwise deductible. This process continues for future taxable years in

which DDR attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in the original disqualified taxable year is otherwise deductible. No deduction is allowed in any taxable year for any AIR or DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year for the excess of those amounts over the deduction limit (as reduced, if applicable) for that disqualified taxable year at the time the deduction limitation is applied to the remuneration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The deduction limitation with respect to any applicable individual for any disqualified taxable year is applied to AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by that applicable individual in that disqualified taxable year at the time that the remuneration becomes otherwise deductible, and each time the deduction limitation is applied to an amount that is otherwise deductible, the deduction limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount against which it is applied. Accordingly, the deduction limitation is applied first to an applicable individual's AIR attributable to services performed in a disqualified taxable year and is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the AIR to which the deduction limit is applied. If the applicable individual also has an amount of DDR attributable to services performed in that disqualified taxable year that becomes otherwise deductible in a subsequent taxable year, the deduction limit, as reduced, is applied to that amount of DDR in the first taxable in which the DDR becomes otherwise deductible. The deduction limit is then further reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the DDR to which the deduction limit is applied. If the applicable individual has an additional amount of DDR attributable to services performed in the original disqualified taxable year that becomes otherwise deductible in a subsequent taxable year, the deduction limit, as further reduced, is applied to that amount of DDR in the taxable year in which it is otherwise deductible. This process continues for future taxable years in

which DDR attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in the original disqualified taxable year is otherwise deductible. No deduction is allowed in any taxable year for any AIR or DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year for the excess of those amounts over the deduction limit (as reduced, if applicable) for that disqualified taxable year at the time the deduction limitation is applied to the remuneration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application to payments--(A) In general. Any payment of remuneration may include amounts that are attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in one or more taxable years of a covered health insurance provider pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) through (11) of this section. In that case, a separate deduction limitation applies to each portion of the payment that is attributed to services performed in a different disqualified taxable year. Any portion of a payment that is attributed to a taxable year that is a disqualified taxable year is deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed the deduction limit that applies with respect to the applicable individual for that disqualified taxable year, as reduced by the amount, if any, of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed in that disqualified taxable year that was deductible in an earlier taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. For purposes of these examples, each corporation has a taxable year that is the calendar year and is a covered health insurance provider for all relevant taxable years; DDR is otherwise deductible in the taxable year in which it is paid; and amounts payable under nonaccount balance plans are not forfeitable upon the death of the applicable individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L is an applicable individual of corporation O. During O's 2015 taxable year, O pays L $550,000 in salary, which is AIR, and grants L a right to $50,000 of DDR payable upon L's separation from service from O. L has a separation from service in 2020, at which time O pays L the $50,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by L in O's 2015 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $500,000 deduction limitation for 2015 is applied first to L's $550,000 of AIR for 2015. Because the $550,000 of AIR in 2015 is greater than the deduction limit, O may deduct only $500,000 of the AIR for 2015, and $50,000 of the $550,000 of AIR is not deductible for any taxable year. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services provided by L in O's 2015 taxable year is then reduced to zero. Because the $50,000 in DDR attributable to services performed by L in 2015 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, that $50,000 is not deductible for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> M is an applicable individual of corporation N. During N's 2016 taxable year, N pays M $300,000 in salary, which is AIR, and grants M a right to $220,000 of DDR payable on a fixed schedule beginning upon M's separation from service. The $220,000 is attributable to services provided by M in N's 2016 taxable year. M ceases providing services on December 31, 2016. In 2020, N pays M $120,000 of DDR that is attributable to services performed in N's 2016 taxable year. In 2021, N pays M the remaining $100,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by M in N's 2016 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $500,000 deduction limitation for 2016 is applied first to M's $300,000 of AIR for 2016. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, N may deduct the entire $300,000 of AIR paid in 2016. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $200,000 because the limitation is reduced by the amount of AIR ($500,000 - $300,000). The reduced deduction limit is then applied to M's $120,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by M in N's 2016 taxable year that is paid in 2020. Because the reduced deduction limit of $200,000 is greater than the $120,000 of DDR, N may deduct the entire $120,000 of DDR paid in 2020. The $200,000 deduction limit is reduced to $80,000 by the $120,000 in DDR because the limit is reduced by the amount of DDR to which the deduction limit applied ($200,000 - $120,000). The reduced deduction limit of $80,000 is then applied to the remaining $100,000 payment of DDR attributable to services performed by M in N's 2016 taxable year. Because the $100,000 payment by N for 2021 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of $80,000, N may deduct only $80,000 of the payment for the 2021 taxable year, and $20,000 of the $100,000 payment is not deductible by N for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> N is an applicable individual of corporation M for all relevant taxable years.

N's AIR from M is $425,000 for 2015, $450,000 for 2016, and $500,000 for 2017. On January 1, 2018, in accordance with the plan terms, M pays $200,000 to N, which is a payment of N's entire account balance under the plan. M uses the account balance ratio method to attribute amounts to services performed in taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine the extent to which M is entitled to a deduction for any portion of the $200,000 payment under the plan, the payment must first be attributed to services performed by N in M's taxable years in accordance with the attribution rules set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The increase in N's account balance during 2015 is $50,000 ($50,000 - zero); the increase in N's account balance for 2016 is $50,000 ($100,000 - $50,000); and the increase in N's account balance for 2017 is $100,000 ($200,000 - $100,000). The sum of all the increases is $200,000 ($50,000 + $50,000 + $100,000). Accordingly, for N's 2015 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .25 ($50,000/$200,000); for N's 2016, taxable year, the attribution fraction is .25 ($50,000/$200,000); and for N's 2017 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .50 ($100,000/$200,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to the $200,000 payment made on January 1, 2018, $50,000 ($200,000 x .25) of DDR is attributable to services performed by N in M's 2015 taxable year; $50,000 ($200,000 x .25) of DDR is attributable to services performed by N in M's 2016 taxable year; and $100,000 ($200,000 x .50) of DDR is attributable to services performed by N in M's 2017 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The $500,000 deduction limitation for 2015 is applied first to N's $425,000 of AIR for 2015. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, M may deduct the entire $425,000 of AIR paid in 2015. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $75,000 by the amount of AIR against which it is applied ($500,000 - $425,000). The reduced deduction limit is then applied to N's $50,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by N in M's 2015 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $50,000 does not exceed the reduced deduction limit of $75,000, all $50,000 of the DDR attributable to services performed by N in M's 2015 taxable year is deductible for 2018, the year of payment. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services performed by N in 2015 is then reduced to $25,000 ($75,000 - $50,000), and this reduced limit is applied to any future payment of DDR attributable to services performed by N in 2015. With respect to M's 2016 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2016 is applied first to N's $450,000 of AIR for 2016. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, M may deduct the entire $450,000 of AIR paid in 2016. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $50,000 by the AIR ($500,000 - $450,000). The reduced deduction limit is then applied to N's $50,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by N in M's 2016 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $50,000 does not exceed the reduced deduction limit of $50,000, all $50,000 of the DDR attributed to M's 2016 taxable year is deductible for 2018, the year of payment. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services performed by N in 2016 is then reduced to zero, and this reduced limit is applied to any future payment of DDR attributable to services performed by N in 2016. With respect to M's 2017 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2017 is applied first to N's $500,000 of AIR for 2017. Because the deduction limit is not greater than the AIR, M may deduct the entire $500,000 of AIR paid in 2017. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to zero by the amount of the AIR against which it is applied ($500,000 - $500,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to N's $100,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by N in M's 2017 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $100,000 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, the $100,000 of the DDR attributed to services performed by N in M's 2017 taxable year is not deductible for the year of payment (or any other taxable year). As a result, $100,000 of the $200,000 payment ($50,000 + $50,000 + $0) is deductible by M for M's 2018 taxable year, and the remaining $100,000 is not deductible by M for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> O is an applicable individual of corporation L for all relevant taxable years.

L makes contributions to O's account each year and credits earnings based on a predetermined actual investment within the meaning of Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(B). The closing balances in O's account (including contributions, earnings, and distributions made during the year) are $100,000 on December 31, 2016, $250,000 on December 31, 2017, and $50,000 on December 31, 2018. O's AIR from L is $500,000 for 2016, $300,000 for 2017, and $450,000 for 2018. On December 31, 2018, L pays O $400,000 in accordance with the plan terms. On December 31, 2019, O's account balance is $200,000, reflecting additional credits of $125,000 made during the year and earnings on the account. O's AIR from L is $200,000 for 2019. O ceases providing services to L on December 31, 2019. On January 1, 2020, L pays O $200,000 in accordance with the plan terms. L uses the account balance ratio method to attribute amounts to services performed in taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine the extent to which L is entitled to a deduction for any portion of either of the payments under the plan, O's payments under the plan must first be attributed to services performed by O in L's taxable years in accordance with the attribution rules set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of attributing the $400,000 payment made on December 31, 2018 to a taxable year, the increase in O's account balance during 2016 is $100,000 ($100,000 - zero); the increase in O's account balance for 2017 is $150,000 ($250,000 - $100,000); and the increase in O's account balance for 2018 is $200,000 ($50,000 - $250,000 + $400,000 (payment on December 31, 2018)). The sum of all the increases is $450,000 ($100,000 + $150,000 + $200,000). Thus, for L's 2016 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .2222 ($100,000/$450,000); for L's 2017 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .3333 ($150,000/$450,000); and for L's 2018 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .4444 ($200,000/$450,000). Accordingly, with respect to the $400,000 payment made on December 31, 2019, $88,889 ($400,000 x .2222) is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2016 taxable year; $133,333 ($400,000 x .3333) is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2017 taxable year; and $177,778 ($400,000 x .4444) is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2018 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The portion of the $400,000 payment attributed to services performed in a disqualified taxable year under paragraph (d) of this section that exceeds the deduction limit for that disqualified taxable year, as reduced through the date of payment, is not deductible in any taxable year. The $500,000 deduction limit for 2016 is applied first to O's $500,000 of AIR for 2016. Because the deduction limit is equal to the $500,000 of AIR, L may deduct the entire $500,000 of AIR paid in 2016. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to zero by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $500,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $88,889 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2016 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $88,889 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, the $88,889 of DDR attributed to 2016 is not deductible for L's 2018 taxable year or any other taxable year. With respect to L's 2017 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limitation for 2017 is applied first to O's $300,000 of AIR for 2017. Because the $500,000 deduction limit is greater than the $300,000 of AIR, L may deduct the entire $300,000 of AIR paid in 2017. The $500,000 deduction limit is reduced to $200,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $300,000). The reduced deduction limit is then applied to O's $133,333 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2017 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $133,333 does not exceed that reduced deduction limit of $200,000, the $133,333 is deductible for 2018. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services performed by O in 2017 is then reduced to $66,667 ($200,000 - $133,333), and this reduced limit is applied to any future payment of DDR attributable to services performed by O in 2017. With respect to L's 2018 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2018 is applied first to O's $450,000 of AIR for 2018. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, L may deduct the entire $450,000 of AIR paid in 2017. The $500,000 deduction limit is reduced to $50,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $450,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $177,778 attributable to services performed by O in L's 2018 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because the $177,778 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of $50,000, $50,000 of DDR is deductible for L's 2018 taxable year, and $127,778 of the $177,778 is not deductible for L's 2018 taxable year or any other taxable year. As a result, $183,333 of the $400,000 payment ($0 + $133,333 + $50,000) is deductible by L for L's 2018 taxable year, and the remaining $216,667 is not deductible by L for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of attributing amounts paid or made available from the plan in future taxable years, the following adjustments are made to O's account balances to reflect the in-service payment of $400,000 in 2018. O's account balance as of December 31, 2016 is reduced by the $88,889 attributable to 2016; and for 2017 is reduced by the sum of the $133,333 attributable to 2017 and the $88,889 attributable to 2016. Therefore, after attributing the $400,000 payment, O's adjusted closing account balance as of December 31, 2016, is $11,111 ($100,000 - $88,889), and as of December 31, 2017, is $27,778 ($250,000 - $133,333 - $88,889).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of attributing the $200,000 payment made on January 1, 2020, to services performed in the taxable years of S, the increase in O's account balance during 2016 is $11,111 ($11,111 - $0); the increase in O's account balance for 2017 is $16,667 ($27,778 - $11,111); the increase in O's account balance for 2018 is $22,222 ($50,000 - $27,778), and the increase in O's account balance for 2019 is $150,000 ($200,000 - $50,000). The sum of all such increases is $200,000 ($11,111 + $16,667 + $22,222 + $150,000). Thus, for O's 2016 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .0556 ($11,111/$200,000); for O's 2017, taxable year, the attribution fraction is .0833 ($16,667/$200,000); for O's 2018 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .1111 ($22,222/$200,000); for O's 2019 taxable year, the attribution fraction is .7500 ($150,000/$200,000). Accordingly, with respect to the $200,000 payment made on January 1, 2020, $11,111 ($200,000 x .0556) of DDR is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2016 taxable year; $16,667 ($200,000 x .0833) of DDR is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2017 taxable year; $22,222 ($200,000 x .1111) of DDR is attributable to services performed by O in L's 2018 taxable year; and $150,000 ($200,000 x .7500) of DDR is attributable to

For L's 2016 taxable year, the deduction limit is reduced to zero by the $500,000 of AIR for that year. Because $11,111 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, $11,111 of the DDR is not deductible for L's 2020 taxable year or any other taxable year. For L's 2017 taxable year, the deduction limit is reduced to $200,000 by the $300,000 of AIR for that year and further reduced to $66,667 by the $133,333 of DDR previously attributed to 2017. Because $16,667 does not exceed the $66,667 deduction limit, the $16,667 of DDR is deductible for L's 2020 taxable year, the year of payment. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services performed by O in 2017 is then reduced to $50,000 ($66,667 - $16,667), and this reduced limit is applied to any future payment attributable to services performed by O in 2017. For L's 2018 taxable year, the deduction limit is reduced to zero by the $450,000 of AIR for that year and the $50,000 of DDR previously attributed to 2018. Because $22,222 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero for 2018, the $22,222 of DDR is not deductible for L's 2020 taxable year or any other taxable year. For L's 2019 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2019 is applied first to O's $200,000 of AIR for 2019. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, L may deduct the entire $200,000 of AIR paid in 2019. The $500,000 deduction limit is reduced to $300,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $200,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $150,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2019 taxable year that is paid in 2020. Because $150,000 does not exceed the $300,000 limit, the $150,000 of DDR is deductible for L's 2020 taxable year, the year of payment. The deduction limit for remuneration attributable to services performed by O in 2019 is then reduced to $150,000 ($500,000 - $200,000 - $150,000), and this reduced limit is applied to any future payment attributable to services performed by O in 2019. As a result, $166,667 of the $200,000 payment ($0 + $16,667 + $0 + $150,000) is deductible by L for L's 2020 taxable year, the year of payment, and the remaining $33,333 is not deductible by L for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as set forth in Example 4, paragraph (i), except that L uses the principal additions method for attributing remuneration from an account balance plan; principal additions under the plan are $100,000 in 2016, $125,000 in 2017, $150,000 in 2018, and $125,000 in 2019; as of the December 31, 2018 initial date of payment, earnings on the 2016, 2017, and 2018 principal additions are $40,000, $30,000, and $5,000 respectively. Under the terms of the plan, the $400,000 payment made on December 31, 2018, is from principal additions in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and earnings thereon, and the $200,000 payment made on January 1, 2020, is from principal additions in 2018 and 2019, and earnings thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine the extent to which L is entitled to a deduction for any portion of either payment under the plan, the payments to O under the plan must first be attributed to services performed by O in F's taxable years in accordance with the attribution rules set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Under the rules in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the $400,000 payment on January 1, 2019, is attributed to services performed by O in the taxable year to which the payment relates under the terms of the plan. DDR including principal additions and earnings thereon are attributed to services performed by O in a taxable year of L when the $400,000 payment is made to O on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the plan, the $400,000 payment made on December 31, 2018 is attributed to services performed by O in L's 2016 taxable year in the amount of $140,000, and is attributed to services performed by O in L's 2017 taxable year in the amount of $155,000, and the remaining $105,000 ($400,000 - $140,000 - $155,000) is attributed to services performed by O in L's 2018 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The portion of the DDR attributable to services performed in a disqualified taxable year under paragraph (d) of this section that exceeds the deduction limit for that disqualified taxable year, as reduced, is not deductible for any taxable year. The $500,000 deduction limitation for 2016 is applied first to O's $500,000 of AIR for 2016. Because the deduction limit is equal to the $500,000 of AIR, L may deduct the entire $500,000 of AIR paid in 2016. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to zero by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $500,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $140,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2016 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $140,000 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, the $140,000 is not deductible for L's 2018 taxable year (the year of payment), or any other taxable year. For L's 2017 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2017 is applied first to O's $300,000 of AIR for 2017. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, L may deduct the entire $300,000 of AIR paid in 2017. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $200,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $300,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $155,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2017 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $155,000 does not exceed

the reduced deduction limit of $200,000, the $155,000 payment is deductible for 2018. For L's 2018 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limitation for 2018 is applied first to O's $450,000 of AIR for 2018. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, L may deduct the entire $450,000 of AIR paid in 2018. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $50,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $450,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $105,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2018 taxable year that is paid in 2018. Because $105,000 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of $50,000, $55,000 of the $105,000 attributable to L's 2018 taxable year is not deductible for 2018 (the year of payment), or any other taxable year. As a result, $205,000 of the $400,000 payment ($0 + $155,000 + $50,000) is deductible by L for L's 2018 taxable year (the year of payment) and the remaining $195,000 is not deductible by L for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Earnings through January 1, 2020 on the principal addition for L's 2018 taxable year ($50,000) that was not paid as part of the December 31, 2018 payment are $5,000.

Because $55,000 exceeds the reduced deduction limit of zero, the $55,000 is not deductible for 2020, the year of payment (or any other taxable year). With respect to L's 2019 taxable year, the $500,000 deduction limit for 2019 is applied first to O's $200,000 of AIR for 2019. Because the deduction limit is greater than the AIR, L may deduct the entire $200,000 of AIR paid in 2019. The $500,000 deduction limit is then reduced to $300,000 by the amount of the AIR ($500,000 - $200,000). The reduced deduction limit is applied to O's $145,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by O in L's 2019 taxable year that is paid in 2020. Because $145,000 does not exceed the $300,000 reduced limit, the $145,000 is deductible for 2020 (the year of payment).

The total combined deduction for AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year allowed for all members of an aggregated group that are covered health insurance providers for any taxable year is limited to $500,000. Therefore, if two or more members of an aggregated group that are covered health insurance providers may otherwise deduct AIR or DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year, the AIR and DDR otherwise deductible by all members of the aggregated group is combined, and the deduction limitation is applied to the total amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proration of deduction limitation. If the total amount of AIR or DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year that is otherwise deductible by two or more members of an aggregated group in any taxable year exceeds the $500,000 deduction limit (as reduced by previously deductible AIR or DDR, if applicable), the deduction limit is prorated based on the AIR or DDR otherwise deductible by the members of the aggregated group in the taxable year and allocated to each member of the aggregated group. The deduction limit allocated to each member of the aggregated group is determined by multiplying the deduction limit for the disqualified taxable year (as previously reduced, if applicable) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the AIR or DDR otherwise deductible by that member in that taxable year that is attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in the disqualified taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total AIR or DDR otherwise deductible by all members of the aggregated group in that taxable year that is attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in the disqualified taxable year. The

amount of AIR or DDR otherwise deductible by a member of the aggregated group in excess of the portion of the deduction limit allocated to that member is not deductible in any taxable year. If a covered health insurance provider is a member of more than one aggregated group, the deduction limit for that covered health insurance provider under section 162(m)(6) may in no event exceed $500,000 for AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples.

At separate times during 2016, C is an employee of, and performs services for, I, J, and K.

Further, because the aggregate AIR otherwise deductible by I, J, and K for 2016 exceeds the deduction limitation for C for that taxable year, the deduction limit is prorated and allocated to the members of the aggregated group in proportion to the AIR otherwise deductible by each member of the aggregated group for that taxable year. Therefore, the deduction limit that applies to the AIR otherwise deductible by K is $250,000 ($500,000 x ($750,000/$1,500,000)); the deduction limit that applies to the AIR otherwise deductible by J is $150,000 ($500,000 x ($450,000/$1,500,000)); and the deduction limit that applies to AIR otherwise deductible by I is $100,000 ($500,000 x ($300,000/$1,500,000)).

In addition, C becomes entitled to $60,000 of DDR attributable to services provided to K in 2016, which is payable (and paid) on April 1, 2018, and $75,000 of DDR attributable to services provided to J in 2016, which is payable (and paid) on April 1, 2019.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because C's total AIR of $400,000 for 2016 for services provided to K, J, and I do not exceed the $500,000 limitation, K, J, and I may deduct $75,000, $150,000, and $175,000, respectively, for 2016. The deduction limit is then reduced to $100,000 by the total AIR deductible by all members of the aggregated group ($500,000 - $400,000). The deduction limit, as reduced, is then applied to any DDR attributable to services provided by C in 2016 in the first subsequent taxable year that DDR becomes deductible. The first year that DDR for 2016 becomes deductible is 2018, due to the $60,000 payment made on April 1, 2018. Because the $60,000 of DDR otherwise deductible by K does not exceed the 2016 $100,000 deduction limit, K may deduct the entire $60,000 for its 2018 taxable year. The $100,000 deduction limit is then reduced by the $60,000 of DDR deductible by K for 2018, and the reduced deduction limit of $40,000 ($100,000 - $60,000) is applied to the $75,000 of DDR that is otherwise deductible for 2019. Because the DDR of $75,000 otherwise deductible by J exceeds the reduced deduction limit of $40,000, J may deduct only $40,000, and the remaining $35,000 ($75,000 - $40,000) is not deductible by J for that taxable year or any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 2, except that C's DDR of $75,000 attributable to services performed by C in J's 2016 taxable year is payable (and paid) on July 1, 2018.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The results are the same as Example 2, except that the reduced deduction limit of $100,000 is prorated between K and J in proportion to the DDR otherwise deductible by them for 2018.

Because the $60,000 of DDR otherwise deductible by K exceeds the $44,444 deduction limit applied to that remuneration, K may deduct only $44,444 of the $60,000 payment, and $15,556 may not be deducted by K for the 2018 taxable year or any other taxable year. Similarly, because the $75,000 of DDR otherwise deductible by J exceeds the $55,556 deduction limit applied to that remuneration, J may deduct only $55,556 of the $75,000 payment, and $19,444 may not be deducted by J for that taxable year or any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Corporate transactions--(1) Treatment as a covered health insurance provider in connection with a corporate

Accordingly, each member of an acquiring aggregated group that would become a covered health insurance provider solely as a result of a corporate transaction, but is not a covered health insurance provider under the transition period relief described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, is subject to the deduction limitation of section 162(m)(6) for its taxable year in which the corporate transaction occurs with respect to AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by any individual who is an applicable individual of the acquired health insurance issuer and any member of its aggregated group that would have been a covered health insurance provider in the taxable year in which the corporate transaction occurred, even if the corporate transaction had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition relief from the attribution consistency requirements--(i) In general. Paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (d)(4)(i) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section require a covered health insurance provider and all members of its aggregated group to use the same method for attributing remuneration to services performed by applicable individuals consistently for all taxable years (attribution consistency requirements). As a result of a corporate transaction, however, a covered health insurance provider that uses an attribution method for its account balance plans, nonaccount balance plans, or stock options or SARs may become a member of an aggregated group with

another covered health insurance provider that uses a different attribution method for those types of plans or arrangements. In that case, neither member of the aggregated group will be treated as violating the attribution consistency requirements merely because it uses an attribution method that is different from the attribution method used by another member of its aggregated group to attribute remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible in the taxable year in which the corporate transaction occurs. However, the attribution consistency requirements apply with respect to remuneration that becomes otherwise deductible in all subsequent taxable years. Following the date of the corporate transaction, any member of the aggregated group may change the attribution method that it used before the date of the corporate transaction to attribute remuneration under its account balance plans, nonaccount balance plans, or stock options or SARs to make its method consistent with the method used by any other member of the aggregated group.

Under the transition rule of paragraph (i)(1) of this section, no portion of the reduced deduction limit of $300,000 for the 2012 taxable year is applied against the $350,000 payment made in 2015, and accordingly, the deduction limit is not reduced by the amount of that payment. The reduced deduction limit is then applied to Q's $450,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by Q in 2012 that is paid to Q and becomes otherwise deductible in 2016. Because the reduced deduction limit of $300,000 is less than the $450,000 otherwise deductible by Z in 2016, Z may deduct only $300,000 of the DDR, and $150,000 of the $450,000 payment is not deductible by Z in that taxable year or any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> R is an applicable individual of corporation Y, which is a covered health insurance provider for all relevant taxable years. During 2010, Y pays R $400,000 in salary and grants R a right to $200,000 in DDR payable on a fixed schedule in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Pursuant to the fixed schedule, Y pays R $50,000 of DDR in 2011, $50,000 of DDR in

2012, and the remaining $100,000 of DDR in 2013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the deduction limitation for DDR under section 162(m)(6)(A)(ii) is effective for DDR that is attributable to services performed by an applicable individual during any disqualified taxable year beginning after December 31, 2009 that would otherwise be deductible in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2012, only the DDR paid by Y in 2013 is subject to the deduction limitation. However, the limitation is applied as if section 162(m)(6) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section were effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2013. Accordingly, the deduction limitation with respect to remuneration for services performed by R in 2010 is determined by reducing the $500,000 deduction limit by the $400,000 of AIR paid to R for 2010 ($500,000 -$400,000). The reduced deduction limit of $100,000 is further reduced to zero by the $50,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by R in Y's 2010 taxable year that is deductible in each of 2011 and 2012 (($100,000 - $50,000 - $50,000). Because the deduction limit is reduced to zero, none of the $100,000 of DDR attributable to services performed by R in Y's 2010 taxable year and paid to R in 2013 is deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability dates. These regulations are effective on September 23, 2014. The regulations apply to taxable years beginning on or after September 23, 2014.
