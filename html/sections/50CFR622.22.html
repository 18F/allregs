                                Sec. 622.22  Individual fishing quota (IFQ) program for Gulf groupers
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(6)</em> of  this section. Under the IFQ program, the RA initially will assign  eligible participants IFQ shares, in five share   categories. These IFQ shares are equivalent to a percentage of the  annual commercial quotas for DWG, red grouper, gag, Other SWG, and  tilefishes, based on their applicable historical landings. Shares  determine the amount of IFQ allocation for Gulf groupers and tilefishes,  in pounds gutted weight, a shareholder is initially authorized to  possess, land, or sell in a given calendar year. Shares and annual IFQ  allocation are transferable. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section  regarding a requirement for a vessel landing groupers or tilefishes  subject to this IFQ program to have an IFQ vessel account for Gulf  groupers and tilefishes. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section regarding  a requirement for a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement. Details regarding  eligibility, applicable landings history, account setup and transaction  requirements, constraints on transferability, and other provisions of  this IFQ system are provided in the following paragraphs of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section or for a person with a Gulf IFQ  dealer endorsement as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section,  these provisions apply to Gulf groupers and tilefishes regardless of  where harvested or possessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Duration. The IFQ program established by this section will  remain in effect until it is modified or terminated; however, the  program will be evaluated by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management  Council every 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Electronic system requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The administrative functions  associated with this IFQ program, e.g., registration and account setup,  landing transactions, and transfers, are designed to be accomplished  online; therefore, a participant must have access to a computer and  Internet access and must set up an appropriate IFQ account to  participate. The computer must have browser software installed, e.g.  Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox; as well as the software Adobe  Flash Player version 9.0 or greater, which may be downloaded from the  Internet for free. Assistance with online functions is available from  IFQ Customer Service by calling 1-866-425-7627 Monday through Friday  between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. eastern time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The RA will mail initial shareholders and dealers with Gulf  reef fish dealer permits information and instructions pertinent to  setting up an IFQ account. Other eligible persons who desire to become  IFQ participants by purchasing IFQ shares or allocation or by obtaining  a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement must first contact IFQ Customer Service at  1-866-425-7627 to obtain information necessary to set up the required  IFQ account. All current IFQ participants must complete and submit the  application for an IFQ Account to certify their citizenship status and  ensure their account information (e.g., mailing address, corporate  shareholdings, etc.) is up to date. See paragraph (b)(11) of this  section regarding requirements for the application for an IFQ Account.  Each IFQ participant must monitor his/her online account and all  associated messages and comply with all IFQ online reporting  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During catastrophic conditions only, the IFQ program provides  for use of paper-based components for basic required functions as a  backup. The RA will determine when catastrophic conditions exist, the  duration of the catastrophic conditions, and which participants or  geographic areas are deemed affected by the catastrophic conditions. The  RA will provide timely notice to affected participants via publication  of notification in the Federal Register, NOAA weather radio, fishery  bulletins, and other appropriate means and will authorize the affected  participants' use of paper-based components for the duration of the  catastrophic conditions. NMFS will provide each IFQ dealer the necessary  paper forms, sequentially coded, and instructions for submission of the  forms to the RA. The paper forms will also be available from the RA. The  program functions available to participants or geographic areas deemed  affected by catastrophic conditions will be limited under the paper- based system. There will be no mechanism for transfers of IFQ shares or  allocation under the paper-based   system in effect during catastrophic conditions. Assistance in complying  with the requirements of the paper-based system will be available via  IFQ Customer Service 1-866-425-7627 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m.  and 4:30 p.m. eastern time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> IFQ allocation. IFQ allocation is the amount of Gulf groupers  and tilefishes, in pounds gutted weight, an IFQ shareholder or  allocation holder is authorized to possess, land, or sell during a given  fishing year. IFQ allocation for the five respective share categories is  derived at the beginning of each year by multiplying a shareholder's IFQ  share times the annual commercial quota for gag, red grouper, DWG, Other  SWG and tilefishes. If a quota is increased after the beginning of the  fishing year, then IFQ allocation is derived by multiplying a  shareholder's IFQ share at the time of the quota increase by the amount  the annual commercial quota is increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Red grouper and gag multi-use allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Red grouper multi- use allocation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the time the commercial quota for red grouper is  distributed to IFQ shareholders, a percentage of each shareholder's  initial red grouper allocation will be converted to red grouper multi- use allocation. Red grouper multi-use allocation, determined annually,  will be based on the following formula:  Red Grouper multi-use allocation (in percent) = 100 * [Gag ACL - Gag  commercial quota]/Red grouper commercial quota</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Red grouper multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land,  or sell either red grouper or gag under certain conditions. Red grouper  multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell red grouper  only after an IFQ account holder's (shareholder or allocation holder's)  red grouper allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred; and to  possess, land, or sell gag, only after both gag and gag multi-use  allocation have been landed and sold, or transferred. However, if gag is  under a rebuilding plan, the percentage of red grouper multi-use  allocation is equal to zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gag multi-use allocation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the time the commercial quota  for gag is distributed to IFQ shareholders, a percentage of each  shareholder's initial gag allocation will be converted to gag multi-use  allocation. Gag multi-use allocation, determined annually, will be based  on the following formula:  Gag multi-use allocation (in percent) = 100 * [Red grouper ACL - Red  grouper commercial quota]/Gag commercial quota</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gag multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell  either gag or red grouper under certain conditions. Gag multi-use  allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell gag only after an IFQ  account holder's (shareholder or allocation holder's) gag allocation has  been landed and sold, or transferred; and to possess, land, or sell red  grouper, only after both red grouper and red grouper multi-use  allocation have been landed and sold, or transferred. Multi-use  allocation transfer procedures and restrictions are specified in  paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section. However, if red grouper is under a  rebuilding plan, the percentage of gag multi-use allocation is equal to  zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Warsaw grouper and speckled hind classification. Warsaw grouper  and speckled hind are considered DWG species and under certain  circumstances SWG species. For the purposes of the IFQ program for Gulf  groupers and tilefishes, after all of an IFQ account holder's DWG  allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred, or if an IFQ  account holder has no DWG allocation, then Other SWG allocation may be  used to land and sell warsaw grouper and speckled hind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Scamp classification. Scamp is considered a SWG species and  under certain circumstances a DWG. For the purposes of the IFQ program  for Gulf groupers and tilefishes, after all of an IFQ account holder's  Other SWG allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred, or if an  IFQ account holder has no SWG allocation, then DWG allocation may be  used to land and sell scamp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Closing an IFQ account. IFQ account holders may close an IFQ  account by completing and submitting a Close IFQ Account Request Form to  NMFS. This form must be signed by an account holder named on the IFQ  account. If the request to close an IFQ account is being made because  the sole   account holder is deceased, the person requesting the closure must sign  the Close IFQ Account Request Form, indicating the relationship to the  deceased, provide a death certificate, and provide any additional  information NMFS determines is necessary to complete the request. IFQ  shareholder accounts may not be closed until all shares and allocation  have been transferred from the account to another IFQ account holder.  Dealer accounts may not be closed until all cost recovery fees have been  received by NMFS. NMFS' IFQ Customer Service staff may close an IFQ  account if all shares and allocation have been transferred from the  account, all cost recovery fees have been received by NMFS, and no  landing transactions or IFQ transfers have been completed by the IFQ  account holder in at least 1 year. If an account is closed by NMFS' IFQ  Customer Service staff, it may be reopened at the request of the IFQ  account holder by contacting IFQ Customer Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> IFQ operations and requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> IFQ vessel accounts for  Gulf groupers and tilefishes. For a person aboard a vessel, for which a  commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, to fish  for, possess, or land Gulf groupers (including DWG and SWG, as specified  in paragraph (a) of this section or tilefishes (including goldface  tilefish, blueline tilefish, and tilefish), regardless of where  harvested or possessed, a Gulf IFQ vessel account for the applicable  species or species groups must have been established. As a condition of  the IFQ vessel account, a person aboard such vessel must comply with the  requirements of this section, Sec. 622.22, when fishing for groupers or  tilefishes regardless of where the fish are harvested or possessed. An  owner of a vessel with a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish,  who has established an IFQ account for the applicable species, as  specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, online via the NMFS  IFQ Web site https://portal.southeast.fisheries.noaa.gov/cs/main.html,  may establish a vessel account through that IFQ account for that  permitted vessel. If such owner does not have an online IFQ account, the  owner must first contact IFQ Customer Service at 1-866-425-7627 to  obtain information necessary to access the IFQ Web site and establish an  online IFQ account. There is no fee to set-up an IFQ account or a vessel  account. Only one vessel account may be established per vessel under  each IFQ program. An owner with multiple vessels may establish multiple  vessel accounts under each IFQ account. The purpose of the vessel  account is to hold IFQ allocation that is required to land the  applicable IFQ species. A vessel account, or its linked IFQ shareholder  account, must hold sufficient IFQ allocation in the appropriate share  category, at least equal to the pounds in gutted weight of the groupers  and tilefishes on board at the time of advance notice of landing.  Allocation must be transferred to the vessel account, so that the vessel  account holds sufficient IFQ allocation at the time of the landing  transaction (except for any overage allowed as specified in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) for groupers and tilefishes). The vessel account remains  valid as long as the vessel permit remains valid; the vessel has not  been sold or transferred; and the vessel owner is in compliance with all  Gulf reef fish and IFQ reporting requirements, has paid all applicable  IFQ fees, and is not subject to sanctions under 15 CFR part 904. The  vessel account is not transferable to another vessel. The provisions of  this paragraph do not apply to fishing for or possession of Gulf  groupers and tilefishes under the bag limit specified in  Sec. 622.38(b)(2) and (5) respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gulf IFQ dealer endorsements. In addition to the requirement for  a Gulf and South Atlantic dealer permit as specified in  Sec. 622.20(c)(1), for a dealer to first receive groupers and tilefishes  subject to the IFQ program for groupers and tilefishes, as specified in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or for a person aboard a vessel with a  Gulf IFQ vessel account to sell such groupers and tilefishes directly to  an entity other than a dealer, such persons must also have a Gulf IFQ  dealer endorsement. A dealer with a Gulf and South Atlantic dealer  permit can download a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement from the NMFS IFQ Web  site. If such persons do not have an IFQ account, they must first  contact IFQ Customer Service at 1-866-425-7627 to obtain information   necessary to access the IFQ Web site and establish an IFQ account. There  is no fee for obtaining this endorsement. The endorsement remains valid  as long as the Gulf and South Atlantic dealer permit remains valid and  the dealer is in compliance with all Gulf reef fish and IFQ reporting  requirements, has paid all IFQ fees required, and is not subject to any  sanctions under 15 CFR part 904. The endorsement is not transferable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IFQ Landing and transaction requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of  advance notice of landing, the IFQ vessel account, or its linked IFQ  shareholder account, must contain allocation at least equal to the  pounds in gutted weight of grouper or tilefish species to be landed,  except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. At the time  of the landing transaction, the IFQ vessel account must contain  allocation at least equal to the pounds in gutted weight of grouper or  tilefish species to be landed, except as provided in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Such groupers and tilefishes must be sold  and can be received only by a dealer who has a valid Gulf IFQ dealer  endorsement and an active IFQ dealer account (i.e., not in delinquent  status). All IFQ landings and their actual ex-vessel prices must be  reported via the IFQ Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person on board a vessel with an IFQ vessel account landing  the shareholder's only remaining allocation from among any of the  grouper or tilefish share categories, can legally exceed, by up to 10  percent, the shareholder's allocation remaining on that last fishing  trip of the fishing year, i.e. a one-time per fishing year overage. Any  such overage will be deducted from the shareholder's applicable  allocation for the subsequent fishing year. From the time of the overage  until January 1 of the subsequent fishing year, the IFQ shareholder must  retain sufficient shares to account for the allocation that will be  deducted the subsequent fishing year. Share transfers that would violate  this requirement will be prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The dealer must complete a landing transaction report for each  landing of Gulf groupers or tilefishes via the IFQ Web site on the day  of offload, except if the fish are being trailered for transport to a  dealer as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section (in which  case the landing transaction report may be completed prior to the day of  offload), and within 96 hours from the time of landing reported on the  most recent landing notification, in accordance with the reporting  form(s) and instructions provided on the Web site. This report includes  date, time, and location of transaction; weight and actual ex-vessel  price of groupers and tilefishes landed and sold (when calculating the  weight of IFQ groupers and tilefishes during a landing transaction, ice  and water weight may not be deducted from the weight of the fish unless  the actual weight of the ice and water can be determined); and  information necessary to identify the fisherman, vessel, and dealer  involved in the transaction. The fisherman must validate the dealer  transaction report by entering the unique PIN for the vessel account  when the transaction report is submitted. After the dealer submits the  report and the information has been verified by NMFS, the online system  will send a transaction approval code to the dealer and the allocation  holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If there is a discrepancy regarding the landing transaction  report after approval, the dealer or vessel account holder (or his or  her authorized agent) must initiate a landing transaction correction  form to correct the landing transaction. This form is available via the  IFQ Web site. The dealer must then print out the form, both parties must  sign it, and the form must be mailed to NMFS. The form must be received  by NMFS no later than 15 days after the date of the initial landing  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> IFQ cost recovery fees. As required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act,  the RA will collect a fee to recover the actual costs directly related  to the management and enforcement of the IFQ program for Gulf groupers  and tilefishes. The fee cannot exceed 3 percent of the ex-vessel value  of Gulf groupers and tilefishes landed under the IFQ program as  described in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Such fees will be deposited in  the Limited Access System Administration Fund (LASAF). Initially,   the fee will be 3 percent of the actual ex-vessel price of Gulf groupers  and tilefishes landed per trip under the IFQ program, as documented in  each landings transaction report. The RA will review the cost recovery  fee annually to determine if adjustment is warranted. Factors considered  in the review include the catch subject to the IFQ cost recovery,  projected ex-vessel value of the catch, costs directly related to the  management and enforcement of the IFQ program, the projected IFQ balance  in the LASAF, and expected non-payment of fee liabilities. If the RA  determines that a fee adjustment is warranted, the RA will publish a  notification of the fee adjustment in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment responsibility. The IFQ account holder specified in the  documented IFQ landing transaction report for Gulf groupers and  tilefishes is responsible for payment of the applicable cost recovery  fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collection and submission responsibility. A dealer who receives  Gulf groupers or tilefishes subject to the IFQ program is responsible  for collecting the applicable cost recovery fee for each IFQ landing  from the IFQ account holder specified in the IFQ landing transaction  report. Such dealer is responsible for submitting all applicable cost  recovery fees to NMFS on a quarterly basis. The fees are due and must be  submitted, using pay.gov via the IFQ system, at the end of each  calendar-year quarter, but no later than 30 days after the end of each  calendar-year quarter. Fees not received by the deadline are delinquent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fee payment procedure. For each IFQ dealer, the IFQ system  will post, in individual IFQ dealer accounts, an end-of-quarter  statement of cost recovery fees that are due. The dealer is responsible  for submitting the cost recovery fee payments using pay.gov via the IFQ  system. Authorized payment methods are credit card, debit card, or  automated clearing house (ACH). Payment by check will be authorized only  if the RA has determined that the geographical area or an individual(s)  is affected by catastrophic conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fee reconciliation process--delinquent fees. The following  procedures apply to an IFQ dealer whose cost recovery fees are  delinquent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On or about the 31st day after the end of each calendar-year  quarter, the RA will send the dealer an electronic message via the IFQ  Web site and official notice via mail indicating the applicable fees are  delinquent, and the dealer's IFQ account has been suspended pending  payment of the applicable fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On or about the 91st day after the end of each calendar-year  quarter, the RA will refer any delinquent IFQ dealer cost recovery fees  to the appropriate authorities for collection of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Measures to enhance IFQ program enforceability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advance  notice of landing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General requirement. For the purpose of this  paragraph, landing means to arrive at a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or  ramp. The owner or operator of a vessel landing IFQ groupers or  tilefishes is responsible for ensuring that NMFS is contacted at least 3  hours, but no more than 24 hours, in advance of landing to report the  time and location of landing, estimated grouper and tilefish landings in  pounds gutted weight for each share category (gag, red grouper, DWG,  Other SWG, tilefishes), vessel identification number (Coast Guard  registration number or state registration number), and the name and  address of the IFQ dealer(s) where the groupers or tilefishes are to be  received. The vessel must land within 1 hour after the time given in the  landing notification except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) of  this section. The vessel landing groupers or tilefishes must have  sufficient IFQ allocation in the IFQ vessel account, or its linked IFQ  shareholder account, and in the appropriate share category or  categories, at least equal to the pounds in gutted weight of all  groupers and tilefishes on board (except for any overage up to the 10  percent allowed on the last fishing trip) at the time of the advance  notice of landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Submitting an advanced landing notification. Authorized methods  for contacting NMFS and submitting the report include calling IFQ  Customer Service at 1-866-425-7627, completing and submitting to NMFS a  landing notification provided through the VMS   unit, or providing the required information to NMFS through the web- based form available on the IFQ Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Landing prior to the notification time. The owner or operator of  a vessel that has completed a landing notification and submitted it to  NMFS may land prior to the notification time, only if an authorized  officer is present at the landing site, is available to meet the vessel,  and has authorized the owner or operator of the vessel to land early.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Changes to a landing notification. The owner or operator of a  vessel who has submitted a landing notification to NMFS may make changes  to the notification by submitting a superseding notification. If the  initial superseding notification makes changes to one or more of the  following: the time of landing (if landing more than 1 hour after the  time on the notification), the dealer(s), or the estimated weights of  fish to be landed, the vessel does not need to wait an additional 3  hours to land. If the initial superseding notification makes changes to  the landing location, the time of landing is earlier than previously  specified, or more than one superseding notification is submitted on a  trip, the vessel must wait an additional 3 hours to land, except as  provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time restriction on offloading. For the purpose of this  paragraph, offloading means to remove IFQ groupers and tilefishes from a  vessel. IFQ groupers or tilefishes may be offloaded only between 6 a.m.  and 6 p.m., local time, unless an authorized officer is present at the  offloading at 6 p.m., is available to remain at the site while  offloading continues, and authorizes the owner or operator of the vessel  to continue offloading after 6 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restrictions on transfer of IFQ groupers and tilefishes. At- sea or dockside transfer of IFQ groupers or tilefishes from one vessel  to another vessel is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Requirement for transaction approval code. If IFQ groupers or  tilefishes are offloaded to a vehicle for transport or are on a vessel  that is trailered for transport, on-site capability to accurately weigh  the fish and to connect electronically to the online IFQ system to  complete the transaction and obtain the transaction approval code is  required. After a landing transaction has been completed, a transaction  approval code verifying a legal transaction of the amount of IFQ  groupers and tilefishes in possession and a copy of the dealer  endorsement must accompany any IFQ groupers or tilefishes from the  landing location through possession by a dealer. This requirement also  applies to IFQ groupers and tilefishes possessed on a vessel that is  trailered for transport. A dealer may only receive IFQ groupers and  tilefishes transported by a vehicle or a trailered vessel that has a  corresponding transaction approval code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Approved landing locations. IFQ groupers and tilefishes must be  landed at an approved landing location. Landing locations must be  approved by NMFS Office for Law Enforcement prior to a vessel landing  IFQ groupers or tilefishes at these sites. Proposed landing locations  may be submitted online via the IFQ Web site, or by calling IFQ Customer  Service at 1-866-425-7627, at any time; however, new landing locations  will be approved only at the end of each calendar-year quarter. To have  your landing location approved by the end of the calendar-year quarter,  it must be submitted at least 45 days before the end of the calendar- year quarter. NMFS will evaluate the proposed sites based on, but not  limited to, the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Landing locations must have a street address. If there is no  street address on record for a particular landing location, global  positioning system (GPS) coordinates for an identifiable geographic  location must be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Landing locations must be publicly accessible by land and water,  and must satisfy the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vehicles must have access to the site via public roads;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vessels must have access to the site via navigable water;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No other condition may impede free and immediate access to the  site by an authorized law enforcement officer. Examples of such  conditions include, but are not limited to: A locked gate, fence, wall,  or other barrier preventing 24-hour access to the site; a   gated community entry point; a guard; animal; a posted sign restricting  access to the site; or any other physical deterrent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Transfer of IFQ shares and allocation. Until January 1, 2015,  IFQ shares and allocations can be transferred only to a person who holds  a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; thereafter, IFQ  shares and allocations can be transferred only to a U.S. citizen or  permanent resident alien. However, a valid commercial permit for Gulf  reef fish, an IFQ vessel account for Gulf groupers and tilefishes, and  IFQ allocation for Gulf groupers or tilefishes are required to possess  (at and after the time of the advance notice of landing), land or sell  Gulf groupers or tilefishes subject to this IFQ program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Share transfers. Share transfers are permanent, i.e., they  remain in effect until subsequently transferred. Transfer of shares will  result in the corresponding allocation being automatically transferred  to the person receiving the transferred share beginning with the fishing  year following the year the transfer occurred. However, within the  fishing year the share transfer occurs, transfer of shares and  associated allocation are independent--unless the associated allocation  is transferred separately, it remains with the transferor for the  duration of that fishing year. A share transfer transaction that remains  in pending status, i.e., has not been completed and verified with a  transaction approval code, after 30 days from the date the shareholder  initiated the transfer will be cancelled, and the pending shares will be  re-credited to the shareholder who initiated the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Share transfer procedures. Share transfers must be accomplished  online via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ shareholder must initiate a share  transfer request by logging onto the IFQ Web site. An IFQ shareholder  who is subject to a sanction under 15 CFR part 904 is prohibited from  initiating a share transfer. An IFQ shareholder who is subject to a  pending sanction under 15 CFR part 904 must disclose in writing to the  prospective transferee the existence of any pending sanction at the time  of the transfer. Following the instructions provided on the Web site,  the shareholder must enter pertinent information regarding the transfer  request including, but not limited to: amount of shares to be  transferred, which must be a minimum of 0.000001 percent; name of the  eligible transferee; and the value of the transferred shares. For the  first 5 years this IFQ program is in effect, an eligible transferee is a  person who has a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; is  in compliance with all reporting requirements for the Gulf reef fish  fishery and the IFQ program for Gulf groupers and tilefishes; is not  subject to sanctions under 15 CFR part 904; and who would not be in  violation of the share or allocation caps as specified in paragraph  (b)(8) of this section. Thereafter, share transferee eligibility will  only include U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens who are  otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this section. The online  system will verify the information entered. If the information is not  accepted, the online system will send the shareholder an electronic  message explaining the reason(s). If the information is accepted, the  online system will send the transferee an electronic message of the  pending transfer. The transferee must approve the share transfer by  electronic signature. If the transferee approves the share transfer, the  online system will send a transfer approval code to both the shareholder  and transferee confirming the transaction. All share transfers must be  completed and the transaction approval code received prior to December  31 at 6 p.m. eastern time each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation transfers. An allocation transfer is valid only for  the remainder of the fishing year in which it occurs; it does not carry  over to the subsequent fishing year. Any allocation that is unused at  the end of the fishing year is void. Allocation may be transferred to a  vessel account from any IFQ account. Allocation held in a vessel  account, however, may only be transferred back to the IFQ account  through which the vessel account was established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allocation transfer procedures and restrictions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Allocation  transfer procedures. Allocation transfers must be   accomplished online via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ account holder must  initiate an allocation transfer by logging onto the IFQ Web site,  entering the required information, including but not limited to, the  name of an eligible transferee and amount of IFQ allocation to be  transferred and price, and submitting the transfer electronically. An  IFQ allocation holder who is subject to a sanction under 15 CFR part 904  is prohibited from initiating an allocation transfer. An IFQ allocation  holder who is subject to a pending sanction under 15 CFR part 904 must  disclose in writing to the prospective transferee the existence of any  pending sanction at the time of the transfer. If the transfer is  approved, the Web site will provide a transfer approval code to the  transferor and transferee confirming the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multi-use allocation transfer restrictions--(1) Red grouper  multi-use allocation. Red grouper multi-use allocation may only be  transferred after all an IFQ account holder's red grouper allocation has  been landed and sold, or transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gag multi-use allocation. Gag multi-use allocation may only be  transferred after all an IFQ account holder's gag allocation has been  landed and sold, or transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Restricted transactions during the 20-hour online maintenance  window. All electronic IFQ transactions must be completed by December 31  at 6 p.m. eastern time each year. Electronic IFQ functions will resume  again on January 1 at 2 p.m. eastern time the following fishing year.  The remaining 6 hours prior to the end of the fishing year, and the 14  hours at the beginning of the next fishing year, are necessary to  provide NMFS time to reconcile IFQ accounts, adjust allocations for the  upcoming year if the commercial quotas or catch allowances for Gulf  groupers and tilefishes have changed, and update shares and allocations  for the upcoming fishing year. No electronic IFQ transactions will be  available during these 20 hours. An advance notice of landing may still  be submitted during the 20-hour maintenance window by using the vessel's  VMS unit or calling IFQ Customer Service at 1-866-425-7627.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> IFQ share and allocation caps. A corporation's total IFQ share  (or allocation) is determined by adding the applicable IFQ shares (or  allocation) held by the corporation and any other IFQ shares (or  allocation) held by a corporation(s) owned by the original corporation  prorated based on the level of ownership. An individual's total IFQ  share is determined by adding the applicable IFQ shares held by the  individual and the applicable IFQ shares equivalent to the corporate  share the individual holds in a corporation. An individual's total IFQ  allocation is determined by adding the individual's total allocation to  the allocation derived from the IFQ shares equivalent to the corporate  share the individual holds in a corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> IFQ share cap for each share category. No person, including a  corporation or other entity, may individually or collectively hold IFQ  shares in any share category (gag, red grouper, DWG, Other SWG, or  tilefishes) in excess of the maximum share initially issued for the  applicable share category to any person at the beginning of the IFQ  program, as of the date appeals are resolved and shares are adjusted  accordingly. A corporation must provide to the RA the identity of the  shareholders of the corporation and their percent of shares in the  corporation for initial issuance of IFQ shares and allocation, and  provide updated information to the RA within 30 days of when changes  occur. This information must also be provided to the RA any time a  commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish is renewed or transferred  and at the time of renewal of the application for an IFQ Account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Total allocation cap. No person, including a corporation or  other entity, may individually or collectively hold, cumulatively during  any fishing year, IFQ allocation in excess of the total allocation cap.  The total allocation cap is the sum of the maximum allocations  associated with the share caps for each individual share category and is  calculated annually based on the applicable quotas or catch allowance  associated with each share category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Redistribution of shares resulting from permanent revocation. If  a shareholder's IFQ shares have been permanently revoked, the RA will  redistribute the IFQ shares proportionately among remaining shareholders  (subject to cap restrictions) based upon the amount of shares each held  just prior to the redistribution. During December of each year, the RA  will determine the amount of revoked shares, if any, to be  redistributed, and the shares will be distributed at the beginning of  the subsequent fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Annual recalculation and notification of IFQ shares and  allocation. On or about January 1 each year, IFQ shareholders will be  notified, via the IFQ Web site, of their IFQ shares and allocations, for  each of the five share categories, for the upcoming fishing year. These  updated share values will reflect the results of applicable share  transfers and any redistribution of shares (subject to cap restrictions)  resulting from permanent revocation of IFQ shares. Allocation, for each  share category, is calculated by multiplying IFQ share for that category  times the annual commercial quota or commercial catch allowance for that  share category. Updated allocation values will reflect any change in IFQ  share for each share category, any change in the annual commercial quota  or commercial catch allowance for the applicable categories; and any  debits required as a result of prior fishing year overages as specified  in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. IFQ participants can monitor  the status of their shares and allocation throughout the year via the  IFQ Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Gulf grouper and tilefish IFQ program participation for current  grouper and tilefish IFQ account holders. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A current participant in  the Gulf grouper and tilefish IFQ program must complete and submit the  application for an IFQ Account that is available on the Web site  sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, to certify status as a U.S. citizen or permanent  resident alien. The account holder must also complete and submit any  other information on this form that may be necessary for the  administration of the IFQ account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person with an established IFQ account must update and  confirm the account information every 2 years. IFQ accounts are updated  through the submission of the application for an IFQ Account. Accounts  must be updated prior to the account validity date (expiration date of  the account) that is displayed on each account holder's IFQ account  page. The RA will provide each participant who has established an online  account an application approximately 2 months prior to the account  validity date. A participant who is not provided an application at least  45 days prior to the account validity date must contact IFQ Customer  Service at 1-866-425-7627 and request an application. Failure to submit  a completed application prior to the participant's account validity date  will lead to the suspension of the participant's access to his IFQ  account until a completed application is submitted. Participants who  certify that they are either not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident  alien will be ineligible to receive shares or allocation through  transfer.
