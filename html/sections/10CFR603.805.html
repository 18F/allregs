These are payments made  according to a schedule that is based on predetermined measures of  technical progress or other payable milestones. This approach relies  upon the fact that, as the RD&D; progresses throughout the term of the  agreement, observable activity will be taking place. The recipient is  paid upon the accomplishment of a predetermined measure of progress. A  fixed-support TIA must use this payment method (this does not preclude  use of an initial advance payment, if there is no alternative to meeting  immediate cash needs). Payments based on payable milestones is the  preferred method of payment for an expenditure-based TIA if well-defined  outcomes can be identified.</p>
