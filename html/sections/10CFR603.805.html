These are payments made according to a schedule that is based on predetermined measures of technical progress or other payable milestones. This approach relies upon the fact that, as the RD&D; progresses throughout the term of the agreement, observable activity will be taking place. The recipient is paid upon the accomplishment of a predetermined measure of progress. A fixed-support TIA must use this payment method (this does not preclude use of an initial advance payment, if there is no alternative to meeting immediate cash needs). Payments based on payable milestones is the preferred method of payment for an expenditure-based TIA if well-defined outcomes can be identified.</p>
