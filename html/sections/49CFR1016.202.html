                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in Sec.  1016.105(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes that there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may file a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The burden is on the moving party to justify the confidentiality of the information.
