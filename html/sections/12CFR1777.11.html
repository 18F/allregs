                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Level I supervisory response--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supervisory letter. Not later  than five business days after OFHEO determines that a development  enumerated in Sec. 1777.10 has transpired, OFHEO shall deliver a  supervisory letter alerting the chief executive officer or the board of  directors of the Enterprise to OFHEO's determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contents of supervisory letter. The supervisory letter shall  notify the Enterprise that, pursuant to this subpart, OFHEO is  commencing review of a potentially adverse development. As is  appropriate under the particular circumstances and the nature of the  potentially adverse development, the letter may direct the Enterprise to  undertake one or more of the following actions, as of such time as OFHEO  directs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide OFHEO with any relevant information known to the  Enterprise about the potentially adverse development, in such format as  OFHEO directs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Respond to specific questions and concerns that OFHEO poses  about the potentially adverse development; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take appropriate action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review; further action. Based on the Enterprise's response to  the supervisory letter and consideration of other relevant factors,  OFHEO shall promptly determine whether the Level I supervisory response  is adequate to resolve any supervisory issues implicated by the  potentially adverse development, or whether additional supervisory  response under this section is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sequence of supervisory responses. The Level II through Level IV  supervisory responses in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section may  be carried out in any sequence, including simultaneous performance of  two or more such responses. OFHEO may also carry out one or more such  responses simultaneously with a Level I supervisory response pursuant to  this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Level II supervisory response--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special review. In addition  to any other supervisory response described in this section, OFHEO may  conduct a special review of an Enterprise in order to assess the impact  of the potentially adverse development on the Enterprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review; further action. Based on the results of the special  review and consideration of other factors deemed by OFHEO to be  relevant, OFHEO shall promptly determine whether additional supervisory  response under this section is warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Level III supervisory response--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Action plan. In addition to  any other supervisory response described in this section, OFHEO may  direct the Enterprise to prepare and submit an action plan to OFHEO, in  such format and at such time as OFHEO directs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contents of action plan. Such action plan shall include, subject  to additional direction by OFHEO, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of any potentially adverse development arising from  conditions or practices internal to the Enterprise, any relevant  information known to the Enterprise about the circumstances that led to  the potentially adverse development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An assessment of likely consequences that the potentially  adverse development may have for the Enterprise; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed course of action the Enterprise will undertake in  response to the potentially adverse development, including an  explanation as to why such approach is preferred to any other  alternative actions by the Enterprise and how such approach will address  the concerns of OFHEO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review; further action. If OFHEO in its discretion determines  that the information, assessment, or proposed course of action contained  in the action plan is incomplete or inadequate, OFHEO shall promptly  direct the Enterprise to correct such deficiencies to the extent OFHEO  determines such corrections will aid in resolving supervisory issues  implicated by the potentially adverse development, and will   promptly determine whether additional supervisory response under this  section is warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Level IV supervisory response--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice to show cause. In  addition to any other supervisory response described in this section,  OFHEO may issue written notice to the chief executive officer or the  board of directors of the Enterprise directing the Enterprise to show  cause, on or before the date specified in the notice, why OFHEO should  not issue one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A notice of charges to the Enterprise under section 1371 of the  1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4631) and the procedures in 12 CFR part 1780  commencing an action to order the Enterprise to cease and desist  conduct, conditions, or violations specified in the notice to show  cause;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A temporary order to the Enterprise under section 1372 of the  1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4632) and the procedures in 12 CFR part 1780 to  cease and desist from, and take affirmative actions to prevent or remedy  harm from, conduct, conditions, or violations specified in the notice to  show cause;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A notice of charges under section 1376 of the 1992 Act (12  U.S.C. 4636) and the procedures in 12 CFR part 1780 commencing  imposition of a civil money penalty against the Enterprise; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A notice of discretionary reclassification of the Enterprise's  capital classification under section 1364(b) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C.  4614(b)) and subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review; further action. Based on the Enterprise's response to  the notice to show cause and consideration of other relevant factors,  OFHEO shall promptly determine whether to commence the actions described  in the notice, and whether additional supervisory response under this  section is warranted.</p>
