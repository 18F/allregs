CMS may also consider the extent to which the proposed service area mirrors service areas of existing commercial health care plans or MA plans offered by the organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For all MA coordinated care plans, whether the contracting provider network meets the access and availability standards set forth in Sec. 422.112.
