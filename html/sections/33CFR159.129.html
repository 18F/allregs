Vapor readings must be taken in the void being protected and must indicate a leakage less than 20 percent of the lower explosive limit of the mixture in the chamber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components providing ignition protection by means other than vapor exclusion must be fitted with an ignition source, such as a spark plug, and a means of injecting an explosive mixture of gasoline or propane and air into the void that protects the component. Connections must be made so as to minimize any additional volume added to the protected void by the apparatus

delivering the explosive mixture. The component must be placed in a chamber filled with an explosive mixture and there must be no ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the component when the following tests are conducted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Using any overload protection that is part of the device, the potential ignition source must be operated for one half hour at 110 percent of its rated voltage, one half hour at 50 percent of its rated voltage and one half hour at 100 percent of its rated voltage with the motor or armature locked, if the potential ignition source is a motor or part of a motor's electrical circuit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the explosive mixture in the protected void, the test installed ignition source must be activated 50 times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tests paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section must be repeated with any plugs removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Components that are certified as being intrinsically safe in accordance with the Instrument Society of America (RP 12.2) or explosion proof in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories STD 698 in Class I, Group D hazardous locations (46 CFR 111.80-5(a)) need not be subjected to this testing.</p>
