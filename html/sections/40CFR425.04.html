                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A POTW receiving wastewater from a facility subject to this part  may require more stringent pretreatment standards for sulfide than those  established by this part without EPA approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The pretreatment standards for sulfide established by this part  will not apply if the POTW receiving wastewater from a facility subject  to this part certifies in writing with explanation of relevant factors  considered, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this  section, that the discharge of sulfide from the facility does not  interfere with the operation of the POTW. In making this determination,  the POTW shall consider all relevant factors including but not limited  to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The presence and characteristics, of other industrial  wastewaters which can increase or decrease sulfide concentrations, pH,  or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The characteristics of the sewer/interceptor collection system  which either minimize or enhance opportunities for release of hydrogen  sulfide gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The characteristics of the receiving POTWs headworks,  preliminary and primary treatment systems, and sludge holding and  dewatering facilities which either minimize or enhance opportunities for  release of hydrogen sulfide gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The occurrence of any prior sulfide related interference as  defined in Sec. 425.02(j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On October 13, 1983, a POTW which intends to certify that the  sulfide pretreatment standard should not apply must publish, in a local  newspaper with the largest circulation, a notice that presents the  findings supporting this determination consistent with paragraph (a) of  this section. Allowance for public hearing of these findings also must  be provided. The POTW shall identify all existing facilities to which  the sulfide pretreatment standard otherwise established by this part  would not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On January 11, 1984, a POTW which intends to certify that the  sulfide pretreatment standard should not apply must file a written  certification with the Regional Water Management Division Director,  Environmental Protection Agency, in the appropriate Regional Office.  This certification shall include the findings supporting this  determination and the results of public comments, and public hearing(s)  if held.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On February 10, 1984, EPA shall acknowledge to the POTW receipt  of any certification submitted under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this  section, and shall indicate to the POTW the adequacy of the submission  based upon a review of the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days of the date of receipt of adequate submissions  under paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, EPA shall  publish a notice in the Federal Register identifying those facilities to  which the sulfide pretreatment standards of this part shall not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A POTW may certify that the sulfide pretreatment standards of  this part should not apply to a new source planning to discharge into  the POTW. This certification must be submitted prior to the commencement  of discharge, and must conform at a minimum with criteria in paragraph  (b) of this section and the general procedures and intervals of time  contained in paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, after EPA and the POTW have determined in accordance with  this section that the sulfide pretreatment standards of this part are  not applicable to specified facilities, a POTW then determines that  there have been changed circumstances (including but not limited to  changes in the factors specified in paragraph (b) of this section) which  justify application of the sulfide pretreatment standards, the POTW  shall revoke the certification submitted under paragraph (c) of this  section. The POTW and EPA shall then adhere to the general procedures  and time intervals contained in paragraph (c) of this section in order  to determine whether the sulfide pretreatment standards contained in  this part are applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the sulfide  pretreatment standards of this part are applicable to a specified  facility, the indirect discharger shall comply with the sulfide  pretreatment standards no later than 18 months from the date of  publication of the Federal Register notice identifying the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At any time after October 13, 1983, if a POTW determines that  there have   been changed circumstances (including but not limited to changes in the  factors specified in paragraph (b) of this section), it may initiate  proceedings contained in paragraph (c) of this section to determine that  the sulfide pretreatment standards of this part shall not be applicable.  The POTW and EPA shall follow the procedures and time intervals  contained in paragraph (c) of this section to make this determination. A  final determination that the sulfide pretreatment standards are not  applicable must be made prior to the discharge of sulfide not in  accordance with the standards set forth in this part.
