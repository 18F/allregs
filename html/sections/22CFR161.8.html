                            <p class="depth0">In reviewing proposed actions for potential environmental effects in  the United States responsible action officers will follow the procedural  steps set forth below. These steps are developed in conjunction with the  procedural steps required by the CEQ Regulations which are referenced in  the following sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preliminary environmental evaluations. Early in the process of  considering any possible action the responsible action officer shall  review the action to determine if it may cause potential significant  environmental effects on the environment of the United States. A  proposed action shall be reviewed initially to determine into which of  the following three basic categories of action it falls:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actions categorically excluded from environmental impact  statements; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actions normally requiring environmental assessments. If the  responsible action officer concludes that the proposed action is a major  action potentially having significant effects in the United States he  should, in cooperation with other appropriate Departmental officials,  carry out the steps described in these regulations. If during his review  of the location of potential environmental effects or following  preparation of an environmental assessment it is determined that the  action could affect the environment of the global commons or a foreign  nation the officer is responsible for ensuring compliance with the  Department's procedures for implementing Executive Order No. 12114 on  Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions (Foreign Affairs  Manual, Volume 2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental Assessment. An environmental assessment is a  concise document which analyzes potential environmental effects to  determine if an environmental impact statement is required (CEQ  Regulations Sec. Sec. 1501.3 and 1508.9). If the action does not fall  into either the category of those actions normally requiring an  environmental impact statement or that of actions categorically excluded  from the requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement, then  the responsible action officer, in cooperation with other Departmental  officials, shall prepare an environmental assessment to determine  whether it is necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement or  a ``Finding of no significant impact''. If the action normally requires  an environmental impact statement, there is ordinarily no need for the  preparation of an environmental assessment and the environmental impact  statement process should be initiated without preparing such an  assessment. If the action is categorically excluded, no further  environmental review is needed. If an environmental assessment is  prepared it may also be used to evaluate whether the proposed action may  have effects outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Finding of no significant impact. If the environmental  assessment indicates that the environmental effects of the action in the  United States are not significant, then the responsible action officer  shall make a ``Finding of no significant impact'', thereby concluding  the NEPA review process (CEQ Regulations Sec. Sec. 1501.4 and 1508.13).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Environmental impact statement. If the environmental assessment  demonstrates that the environmental effects of the action with the  United States may be ``significant'' (see Sec. 1508.27 of the CEQ  Regulations) the Department is required to prepare an environmental  impact statement (EIS) in accordance with these regulations (see also  CEQ Regulations Sec. 1501.8, part 1502 and Sec. Sec. 1506.2 through  1506.7). In preparing the environmental impact statement the following  steps will be carried out:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of intent to prepare an EIS. If an impact statement is  required, the Department will publish in the Federal Register a ``Notice  of intent'' to prepare such a statement (CEQ Regulations Sec. Sec.  1501.7 and 1508.22).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scoping procedures. The Department will then hold a scoping  meeting with interested agencies and individuals to determine the proper  content (``scope'') of the statement (CEQ Regulations Sec. Sec. 1501.7  and 1508.25).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The Department will  then prepare a draft EIS (DEIS) which will be filed with the  Environmental Protection Agency and circulated to agencies and the  public for comment for at least 45 days, except where the CEQ  Regulations and these regulations permit the time period to be shortened  (CEQ Regulations Sec. 1501.8, part 1502, Sec. Sec. 1506.2 through  1506.7, 1506.10(d) and 1506.11; 161.7(d), 161.9(n)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final environmental impact statement (FEIS). In light of the  comments and following any revision in the draft EIS, the Department  will file with the Environmental Protection Agency and circulate to  agencies and the public a final EIS at least 30 days before making a  final decision on the action, except where the CEQ Regulations and these  regulations permit the time period to be shortened (CEQ Regulations  Sec. Sec. 1506.9, 1506.10(d), 1506.11; 161.7(d), 161.9(n)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Record of decision. After making a decision on the action, the  Department will make available a formal ``Record of decision'' (CEQ  Regulations Sec. 1505.2).</p>
