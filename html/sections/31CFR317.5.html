The Secretary of the Treasury or a delegate may terminate the qualification of an issuing agent at any time, upon due notice to the agent. If this action is taken, the agent will be required to make a final accounting for the balance of savings bond stock for which it is charged, based on the records of the designated Federal Reserve Bank. The agent must surrender all unissued bonds and remit the issue price of any remaining bonds included in its accountability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At request of issuing agent. A designated Federal Reserve Bank will terminate the qualification of an issuing agent upon its request, provided the agent is in full compliance with the terms of its agreement and the applicable regulations and instructions, and renders a final accounting.
