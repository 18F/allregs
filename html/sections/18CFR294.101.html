Notwithstanding any other  provision of this part, if a public utility provides in its rate  schedule that it will make such reports to the appropriate state  regulatory agency and to its firm power wholesale requirements  customers, then it need only report to the Commission the nature and  projected duration of the anticipated capacity or energy supply shortage  and supply a list of the firm power wholesale customers affected or  likely to be affected by the shortage.
