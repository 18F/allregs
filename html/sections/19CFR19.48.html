                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for suspension or revocation. The port director may  revoke or suspend the privilege of operating a container station if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The privilege was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of  a material fact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The container station operator refuses or neglects to obey any  proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or  regulation relative to the operation of a container station;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The container station operator or an officer of a corporation  which has been granted the privilege of operating a container station is  convicted of or has committed acts which would constitute a felony, or a  misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any  change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g.,  discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a  felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft,  smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed  while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this  provision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The container station operator fails to retain merchandise which  has been designated for examination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The container station operator does not provide secure  facilities or properly safeguard merchandise within the container  station;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The container station operator fails to furnish a current list  of names, addresses, and other information required by Sec. 19.46; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The bond required by Sec. 19.40 is determined to be  insufficient in amount or lacking sufficient sureties, and a  satisfactory new bond with good and sufficient sureties is not furnished  within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice and appeal. The port director shall suspend or revoke the  privilege of operating a container station by serving notice of the  proposed action in writing upon the container station operator. The  notice shall be in the form of a statement specifically setting forth  the grounds for revocation or suspension of the privilege and shall be  final and conclusive upon the container station operator unless he shall  file with the port director a written notice of appeal. The container  station operator may file a written notice of appeal from the revocation  or suspension within 10 days following receipt of the notice of  revocation or suspension. The notice of appeal shall be filed in  duplicate and shall set forth the response of the container station  operator to the statement of the port director. The container station  operator, in his notice of appeal, may request a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearing on appeal. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held  before a   hearing officer designated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his  designee within 30 days following application therefor. The container  station operator shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing  at least 5 days prior thereto. The container station operator may be  represented by counsel at the revocation or suspension hearing. All  testimony in the proceeding shall be subject to cross-examination. A  stenographic record of any such proceeding shall be made and a copy  thereof shall be delivered to the container station operator. At the  conclusion of such proceeding or review of a written appeal, the hearing  officer or the port director, as the case may be, shall forthwith  transmit all papers and the stenographic record of any hearing, to the  Commissioner of Customs, together with his recommendation for final  action. Following a hearing and within 10 calendar days after delivery  of a copy of the stenographic record, the container station operator may  submit to the Commissioner of Customs, in writing, additional views and  arguments on the basis of such record. If neither the container station  operator nor his attorney appear for a scheduled hearing, the hearing  officer shall conclude the hearing and transmit all papers with his  recommendation to the Commissioner of Customs. The Commissioner shall  thereafter render his decision, in writing, stating his reasons  therefor, with respect to the action proposed by the hearing officer or  the port director. Such decision shall be transmitted to the port  director and served by him on the container station operator.
