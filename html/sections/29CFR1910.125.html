Your dip tank must be made of noncombustible material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When must I provide overflow piping? (1) You must provide properly trapped overflow piping that discharges to a safe location for any dip tank having:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A capacity greater than 150 gallons (568 L); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A liquid surface area greater than 10 feet \2\ (0.95 m\2\).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must also ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any overflow piping is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and has sufficient capacity to prevent the dip tank from overflowing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Piping connections on drains and overflow pipes allow ready access to the interior of the pipe for inspection and cleaning; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The bottom of the overflow connection is at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) below the top of the dip tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When must I provide a bottom drain?
