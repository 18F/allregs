                            <p class="depth0">A cushion of credit account shall be automatically established by  RUS for each borrower who makes a payment after October 1, 1987, in  excess of amounts then due on an RUS note. Such account will bear  interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum. All payments on RUS notes  which are in excess of required payments and not otherwise designated  shall be deposited in the borrowers' respective cushion of credit  accounts. Payments received in the month in which an installment is due  will be applied to the installment due. However, if the regular  installment payment is received at a later date in the month, the first  payment received will be applied retroactively to a cushion of credit  account and the second will be applied to the installment due.</p>
