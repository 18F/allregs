                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disbursement cycle. In honoring and complying with a court  decree or property settlement, the Board shall not be required to  disrupt its normal disbursement cycle, despite any special schedule of  accrual or payment of amounts due the spouse or former spouse set forth  in the decree or settlement. A decree or settlement received too late to  be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it was received shall  be honored with respect to the next payment due the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liability for payments. Neither the Board nor any of its  employees shall be liable with respect to any payment made to any  individual from moneys due from or payable by the Board pursuant to a  court decree or property settlement regular on its face, if such payment  is made in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability for disclosures. No employee of the Board whose duties  include responding to requirements contained in this part shall be  subject under any law to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal  liability or penalty for, or on account of, any disclosure of  information made by such employee in connection with the performance of  the employee's duties in making such response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicable law. For purposes of a proceeding under this part,  the Board will apply the law of the jurisdiction in which the court  decree or property settlement was issued unless it comes to the  attention of the Board that the state of issuance has no contact with  the plaintiff or defendant in the action; in which case, the Board may,  in its sole discretion, apply the law of any jurisdiction with  significant interest in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Erroneous payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a spouse or former spouse receives a  payment pursuant to this part from an employee's benefit, and the Board  later determines that the employee was not entitled to all or part of  those benefits for any month, the amount of the employee's benefits  which was paid to the   spouse or former spouse in excess of the amount which was actually  payable shall be an erroneous payment to the spouse or former spouse  within the meaning of section 10 of the Railroad Retirement Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where all documentation required by this part is in the Board's  records pertaining to the employee prior to the time the employee  annuity is awarded, but where the Board due to clerical oversight fails  to withhold the amount awarded by the court order, then the Board shall  begin deduction from the employee annuity with the month the error is  discovered, and shall pay the amount which should have been withheld  pursuant to this part to the spouse or former spouse. The amount paid to  the spouse or former spouse representing months for which the amount  under the order was not timely withheld shall be an erroneous payment to  the employee within the meaning of section 10 of the Railroad Retirement  Act. This section shall not apply where the Board has attempted to  contact the spouse or former spouse at the time the employee annuity is  awarded pursuant to Sec. 295.4(d).
