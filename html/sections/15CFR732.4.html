                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export or  reexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General Prohibitions  One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or  Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the steps  listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport is  subject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S. Person  Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders, Terms, and  Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), there are no License  Exceptions available for your export or reexport. If your export is  subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User), consult part 744  of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition  Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR for applicable License  Exceptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Steps for License Exceptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Step 20: Applicability of  General Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the general  prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your export  or reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export or  reexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and need not  review part 740 of the EAR regarding License Exceptions. You are  reminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance of  the U.S. Customs Service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all License  Exceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in  Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one or  more of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptions  available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from  the export or reexport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If  none of the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies, then review  each of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of them  authorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptions  is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use,  and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a  specific License Exception.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may meet the conditions for more than one License  Exception. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some License  Exceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest License  Exceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. You  are not required to use the most restrictive applicable License  Exception. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that you  first consider, you may consider any other License Exception until you  have determined that no License Exception is available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> License Exceptions TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSU authorize  exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. List-based License  Exceptions (LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, and APP) are available only to the  extent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorization  for reexports only to the extent each License Exception expressly  authorizes reexports. Some ECCNs contain License Exception STA exclusion  paragraphs. Those paragraphs delineate items excluded from the License  Exception STA provisions in Sec. 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR. License  Exception APR authorizes reexports only.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If you are exporting under License Exceptions GBS, CIV, LVS,  STA, APP, TSR or GOV, you should review Sec. 743.1 of the EAR to  determine the applicability of certain reporting requirements. If you  are exporting under License Exceptions LVS, TMP, RPL,   STA, or GOV and your item is classified in the ``600 series,'' you  should review Sec. 743.4 of the EAR to determine the applicability of  certain reporting requirements for conventional arms exports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptions  are limited by country or by type of item.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference.  For a listing of country groups, please refer to Supplement No. 1 to  part 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception,  License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports to embargoed  destinations. If your export or reexport is subject to General  Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, License Exceptions  are only available to the extent specifically provided in part 746 of  the EAR concerning embargoed destinations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. No  License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used for  items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. License  Exceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a License  Exception is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport.  However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by the  License Exception that you determined authorized your export or  reexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR to determine  your recordkeeping and documentation requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception is  available, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding with  your export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export or  reexport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Step 26: License applications. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are going to file a  license application with BIS, you should first review the requirements  in part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and transferors should  review the instructions concerning applications and required support  documents prior to submitting an application for a license.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you are going to file a license application with BIS for the  export, reexport or in-country transfer for an aircraft controlled under  ECCNs 9A610.a, Sec. 740.20(g) permits you to request in the application  that subsequent exports of the type of aircraft at issue be eligible for  export under License Exception STA. The types of aircraft controlled  under ECCN 9A610.a that have been determined to be eligible for License  Exception STA pursuant to Sec. 740.20(g) are identified in the License  Exceptions paragraph of ECCN 9A610. Supplement No. 2 to part 748,  paragraph (w) (License Exception STA eligibility requests), contains the  instructions for such applications.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (b)(7)(ii): If you intend to use License Exception  STA, return to paragraphs (a) and then (b) of this section to review the  Steps regarding the use of license exceptions.
