The parent holding company

of a member bank owns 100 percent of the shares of a mortgage company. The member bank purchases debt securities issued by the mortgage company for $600.

The parent holding company of a member bank owns 51 percent of the shares of a mortgage company. The member bank purchases an additional 30 percent of the shares of the mortgage company from a third party for $100. The initial carrying value of the shares is $100. The member bank initially must value the investment at $100. Going forward, if the member bank's carrying value of the shares declines to $40, the member bank must continue to value the investment at $100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contribution of the shares of an affiliate. The parent holding company of a member bank owns 100 percent of the shares of a mortgage company and contributes 30 percent of the shares to the member bank. The member bank gives no consideration in exchange for the shares. If the initial carrying value of the shares is $300, then the member bank initially must value the investment at $300. Going forward, if the member bank's carrying value of the shares increases to $500, the member bank must value the investment at $500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing--(1) In general.
