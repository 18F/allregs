                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> and (9) of the Act;  to conduct inspections and investigations under section 8 (except those  necessary to conduct evaluation of the plan under section 18(f) and  other inspections, investigations, or proceedings necessary to carry out  Federal responsibilities not specifically preempted by section 18(e));  to conduct enforcement proceedings in contested cases under section 10;  to institute proceedings to correct imminent dangers under section 13;  and to propose civil penalties or initiate criminal proceedings for  violations of the Federal Act under section 17. The Assistant Secretary  retains jurisdiction under the above provisions in any proceeding  commenced under section 9 or 10 before the effective date of the 18(e)  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. Federal  jurisdiction is also retained with regard to: all employment on the Hill  Air Force Base; all employment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Naval  Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserve, to the extent that it remains a U.S.  DOE facility; Federal government employers and employees; and the U.S.  Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees  and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations.  Where enforcement jurisdiction is shared between Federal and State  authorities for a particular area, project, or facility, in the interest  of administrative practicability, Federal jurisdiction may be assumed  over the entire project or facility. In either of the two aforementioned  circumstances, Federal enforcement may be exercised immediately upon  agreement between Federal and State OSHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of the Act with regard to complaints alleging discrimination  against employees because of the exercise of any right afforded to the  employee by the Act, although such complaints may be referred to the  State for investigation. The Assistant Secretary also retains his  authority under section 6 of the Act to promulgate, modify or revoke  occupational safety and health standards which address the working  conditions of all employees, including those in States which have  received an affirmative 18(e) determination, although such standards may  not be Federally applied. In the event that the State's 18(e) status is  subsequently withdrawn and Federal authority reinstated, all Federal  standards, including any standards promulgated or modified during the  18(e) period, would be Federally enforceable in that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As required by section 18(f) of the Act, OSHA will continue to  monitor the operations of the Utah State program to assure that the  provisions of the State plan are substantially complied with and that  the program remains at least as effective as the Federal program.  Failure by the State to comply with its obligations may result in the  revocation of the final determination under section 18(e), resumption of  Federal enforcement and/or proceedings for withdrawal of plan approval.
