                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section, the following definitions  apply:</p><p class="depth2">Payment means a monetary award given to a suggester in recognition  of, and as a reward for, a suggestion adopted by CMS that improves the  efficiency of, and results in monetary savings to, the Medicare program.</p><p class="depth2">Savings means the monetary value of the net benefits the Medicare  program derives from implementing the suggestion.</p><p class="depth2">Suggester means an individual, a group of individuals, or a legal  entity such as a corporation, partnership, or professional association,  not otherwise excluded under Sec. 420.410(d), who submits a suggestion  under this section.</p><p class="depth2">Suggestion means an original idea submitted in writing.</p><p class="depth2">Suggestion program means the specific procedures and requirements  established by CMS for receiving suggestions from the suggester on  methods to improve the efficiency of the Medicare program, evaluating  the suggestions and, if appropriate, paying a reward to the suggester  for adopted suggestions that result in improved efficiency and produce  monetary savings to the Medicare program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. CMS may make payment for adopted suggestions that  increase the efficiency of the Medicare program and result in monetary  savings. CMS only makes payment for suggestions in instances in which a  reward is not otherwise provided by law. The determination to adopt a  suggestion, to reward the suggester, and the method of calculating a  reward are at the sole discretion of CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this  section, any individual, group of individuals or legal entity, such as a  corporation, partnership or professional association, is eligible to  submit a suggestion and be considered for a reward under this suggestion  program if the suggestion is submitted to CMS in the manner set forth in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exclusions. Medicare contractors, their officers and employees,  individuals who work for Federal agencies under a contract, employees of  Federally-sponsored research and demonstration projects, Federal  officers and employees, and immediate family members of these  individuals, are excluded from receiving payment under the suggestion  program. If, after the suggester receives a reward payment, CMS  determines that the suggester was ineligible to receive the reward, CMS  is not liable for the reward payment and the suggester must refund all  monies received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements for submitting suggestions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be considered,  the suggestion must be in writing, mailed to CMS, and must include the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of an existing problem or need;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A suggested method for solving the problem or filling the need;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If known, an estimate of the savings potential that could  result from implementing the suggestion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suggestions must be mailed to: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services Suggestion Program, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, Maryland  21244-1850.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any suggesters interested in receiving a reward must provide CMS  with the following information: An individual suggester must provide his  or her name, a group of suggesters must provide the names of all the  group members, and a legal entity must provide its name and the name of  its representative. All suggesters must provide an address, telephone  number, and any other identifying information that CMS needs to contact  the suggester for additional information and, where applicable, to mail  the reward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Evaluation process--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relevant factors. CMS evaluates all  suggestions on the basis of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Originality of suggestion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An estimate of potential monetary savings to the Medicare  program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which Medicare program efficiency would be  improved if CMS adopts the suggestion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Accuracy of the information reflected in the suggestion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Feasibility of implementation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Nature and complexity of the suggestion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Any other factors that appear to be relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation time limit. CMS concludes the evaluation process in a  reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 2 years from the receipt date,  taking into consideration the complexity of the suggestion, the number  of possible implementation strategies, and CMS's current workload.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Basis for reward payment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If CMS determines  that it is appropriate to make a reward payment for a suggestion adopted  in whole or in part, that results in improved efficiency and monetary  savings to the Medicare program, the payment is based on--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual first-year net savings to the Medicare program, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The average annual net savings to the Medicare program expected  to be realized over a period of not more than 3 years if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An improvement is expected to yield monetary savings for more  than 1 year and implementation involves substantial costs; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Monetary savings are negligible in the first year but are  expected to substantially increase in subsequent years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reward payment amount. CMS determines the amount of a reward  payment using the following formula:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Net savings from $1,000 to $10,000--10 percent of the savings,  with a minimum award amount of $100;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Net savings of $10,001 to $100,000--$1,000 for the first  $10,000 of savings, plus 3 percent of the net savings over $10,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Net savings of more than $100,000--$3,700 for the first  $100,000 of savings, plus 0.5 percent of savings over $100,000, with a  maximum award amount of $25,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Adoption of suggestion and issuance of reward payment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Adoption. Upon completing its evaluation, CMS decides whether to adopt a  suggestion. If CMS receives the same or an overlapping suggestion from  two or more unrelated parties, CMS will consider a reward only for the  suggestion CMS received first, if the suggestion or overlapping part of  the suggestion are identical, and CMS has adopted that part. If the  suggestions are not identical, CMS will consider rewarding the  suggestion received first, if it is feasible and CMS is able to adopt  and implement the suggestion. If the first suggestion cannot be  implemented, CMS may consider rewarding the suggestion received next,  even if it is similar, provided CMS can adopt and implement the  suggestion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issuance of reward payment. After the reward payment amount is  determined, as described in paragraph (g) of this section, CMS mails  payment to the suggester (or to the legal representatives referenced in  paragraph (k) of this section) only after the suggestion has been in  operation for 1 year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Group suggestions. When CMS deems that a reward payment is  appropriate for a suggestion submitted by a group of individuals, CMS  pays an equal share of the reward to each of the individuals identified  in the group. If an organization such as a corporation, partnership, or  professional association submits a suggestion, CMS makes a single reward  payment to that organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Change in name or address. It is the suggester's responsibility  to notify CMS of any change of address or other relevant information. If  the suggester fails to update CMS on any change in this information, and  the reward payment mailed to the suggester is returned to CMS, the  suggester must claim the reward payment by contacting CMS within 1 year  from the date CMS first mailed the reward payment to the suggester. CMS  does not pay interest on rewards that, for any reason, are delayed or  are not immediately claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Incapacitated or deceased suggester. If the suggester is  incapacitated or has died, an executor, administrator, or other legal  representative may claim the reward on behalf of the suggester or the  suggester's estate. The claimant   must submit certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of  administration, or other similar evidence to CMS showing his or her  authority to claim the reward. The claim must be filed within 1 year  from the date on which CMS first attempted to pay the reward to the  individual who submitted the suggestion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Maintenance of records--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS retains records related to the  administration of the suggestion program in accordance with 36 CFR part  1228 (the regulations for the National Archives and Records  Administration).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS does not disclose information submitted under the suggestion  program, except as required by law.
