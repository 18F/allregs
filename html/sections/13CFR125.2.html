                                Sec. 125.2  What are SBA's and the procuring agency's responsibilities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The objective of the SBA's contracting programs is to assist small business concerns, including 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone small business concerns, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, Women-Owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, in obtaining a fair share of Federal Government prime contracts, subcontracts, orders, and property sales. Therefore, these regulations apply to all types of Federal Government contracts, including Multiple Award Contracts, and contracts for architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation. Small business concerns must receive any award (including orders, and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts) or contract, part of any such award or contract, and any contract for the sale of Government property, regardless of the place of performance, which SBA and the procuring or disposal agency determine to be in the interest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> War or national defense programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property, services and construction for the Government in each industry category are placed with small business concerns; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property is made to small business concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> SBA's responsibilities in the acquisition planning process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> SBA Procurement Center Representative (PCR) Responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> PCR Review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> SBA has PCRs who are generally located at Federal agencies and buying activities that have major contracting programs. At the SBA's discretion, PCRs will review all acquisitions that are not set-aside or reserved for small businesses above or below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, to determine whether a set-aside or sole source award to a small business under one of SBA's programs is appropriate and to identify alternative strategies to maximize the participation of small businesses in the procurement. This review includes acquisitions that are Multiple Award Contracts where the agency has not set-aside all or part of the acquisition or reserved the acquisition for small businesses. It also includes acquisitions where the agency has not set-aside orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts for small business concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> PCRs will work with the cognizant Small Business Specialist (SBS) and agency OSDBU or OSBP as early in the acquisition process as practicable to identify proposed solicitations that involve bundling, and with the agency acquisition officials to revise the acquisition strategies for such proposed solicitations, where appropriate, to increase the probability of participation by small businesses, including small business contract teams and Small Business Teaming Arrangements, as prime contractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In conjunction with their duties to promote the set-aside of procurements for small business, PCRs may identify small businesses that are capable of performing particular requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> PCRs will also ensure that any Federal agency decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with maximum opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition or sale of real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> PCRs will review whether, for bundled and consolidated contracts that are recompeted, the amount of savings and benefits was achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements, that such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated, or such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PCR Recommendations in General. The PCR must recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods that would increase

small business prime contract participation if a PCR believes that a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business and is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely; will render small business prime contract participation unlikely (e.g., ensure geographical preferences are justified); is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects; or if a PCR does not believe a bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified. Such alternatives may include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Breaking up the procurement into smaller discrete procurements, especially construction acquisitions that can be procured as separate projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Breaking out one or more discrete components, for which a small business set-aside may be appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reserving one or more awards for small businesses when issuing Multiple Award Contracts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Using a partial set-aside;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Stating in the solicitation for a Multiple Award Contract that the orders will be set-aside for small businesses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Where the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified, the PCR will work with the procuring activity to tailor a strategy that preserves small business contract participation to the maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> PCR Recommendations for Small Business Teaming Arrangements and Subcontracting. The PCR will work to ensure that small business participation is maximized both at the prime contract level such as through Small Business Teaming Arrangements and through subcontracting opportunities. This may include the subcontracting considerations in source selections set forth in Sec. 125.3(g), as well as the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reviewing an agency's oversight of its subcontracting program, including its overall and individual assessment of a contractor's compliance with its small business subcontracting plans. The PCR will furnish a copy of the information to the SBA Commercial Market Representative (CMR) servicing the contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recommending that the solicitation and resultant contract specifically state the small business subcontracting goals that are expected of the contractor awardee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Recommending that the small business subcontracting goals be based on total contract dollars instead of, or in addition to, subcontract dollars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Recommending that separate evaluation factors be established for evaluating the offerors' proposed approach to small business subcontracting participation in the subject procurement, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and/or the extent to which the offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Recommending that a contracting officer include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates an offeror's commitment to pay small business subcontractors within a specified number of days after receipt of payment from the Government for goods and services previously rendered by the small business subcontractor. The contracting officer will comparatively evaluate the proposed timelines. Such a commitment shall become a material part of the contract. The contracting officer must consider the contractor's compliance with the commitment in evaluating performance, including for purposes of contract continuation (such as exercising options);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> For bundled and consolidated requirements, recommending that a separate evaluation factor with significant weight be established for evaluating the offeror's proposed approach to small business utilization, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and the extent to which the other than small business offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> For bundled or consolidated requirements, recommending the solicitation state that the agency must evaluate offers from teams of small businesses the same as other offers,

with due consideration to the capabilities and past performance of all proposed subcontractors. It may also include recommending that the agency reserve at least one award to a small business prime contractor with a Small Business Teaming Arrangement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> For Multiple Award Contracts and multiple award requirements above the substantial bundling threshold, recommending or requiring that the solicitation state that the agency will solicit offers from small business concerns and small business concerns with Small Business Teaming Arrangements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> For consolidated contracts, ensuring that agencies have provided small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors and making recommendations on such opportunities as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Recommending paragraphs (B) through (I) above apply to an ordering agency placing an order against a Multiple Award Contract or Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> SBA Breakout PCR (BPCR) Responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> BPCRs are assigned to major contracting centers. A major contracting center is a center that, as determined by SBA, purchases substantial dollar amounts of other than commercial items, and which has the potential to achieve significant savings as a result of the assignment of a BPCR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> BPCRs advocate full and open competition in the Federal contracting process and recommend the breakout for competition of items and requirements which previously have not been competed. They may appeal the failure by the buying activity to act favorably on a recommendation in accord with the appeal procedures in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. BPCRs also review restrictions and obstacles to competition and make recommendations for improvement. Other authorized functions of a BPCR are set forth in 48 CFR 19.403(c) (FAR 19.403(c)) and Section 15(l) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(l)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appeals of PCR and Breakout PCR (BPCR) Recommendations. In cases where there is disagreement between a PCR or BPCR and the contracting officer over the suitability of a particular acquisition for a small business set-aside, partial set-aside or reserve, whether or not the acquisition is a bundled, substantially bundled or consolidated requirement, the PCR or BPCR may initiate an appeal to the head of the contracting activity. If the head of the contracting activity agrees with the contracting officer, SBA may appeal the matter to the Secretary of the Department or head of the agency. The time limits for such appeals are set forth in FAR 19.505 (48 CFR 19.505).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procuring Agency Responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirement to Foster Small Business Participation. The Small Business Act requires each Federal agency to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors and subcontractors in the contracting opportunities of the Government regardless of the place of performance of the contract. In addition, Federal agencies must ensure that all bundled and consolidated contracts contain the required analysis and justification and provide small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors. Agency acquisition planners must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Structure procurement requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, including small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, 8(a) BD small business concerns (including those owned by ANCs, Indian Tribes and NHOs), and small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contracts or consolidation of contract requirements that inhibits or precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Follow the limitations on use of consolidated contracts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide SBA the necessary information relating to the acquisition under review at least 30 days prior to issuance of a solicitation. This includes providing PCRs (to the extent allowable pursuant to their security clearance) copies of all documents relating to the acquisition under review, including, but not limited to, the performance of work statement/statement of work, technical data, market research, hard copies or their electronic equivalents of Department of Defense (DoD) Form 2579 or equivalent, and other relevant information. The DoD Form 2579 or equivalent must be sent electronically to the PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirement for market research. Each agency, as part of its acquisition planning, must conduct market research to determine the type and extent of foreseeable small business participation in the acquisition. In addition, each agency must conduct market research and any required analysis and justifications before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated contract. The purpose of the market research and analysis is to determine whether the bundling or consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified and all statutory requirements for such a strategy have been met. Agencies should be as broad as possible in their search for qualified small businesses, using key words as well as NAICS codes in their examination of the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS), and must not place unnecessary and unjustified restrictions when conducting market research (e.g., requiring that small businesses prove they can provide the best scientific and technological sources) when determining whether to set-aside, partially set-aside, reserve or sole source a requirement to small businesses. During the market research phase, the acquisition team must consult with the applicable PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located) and the activity's Small Business Specialist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proposed Acquisition Strategy. A procuring activity must provide to the applicable PCR (or to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity) at least 30 days prior to a solicitation's issuance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A copy of a proposed acquisition strategy (e.g., DoD Form 2579, or equivalent) whenever a proposed acquisition strategy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Includes in its description goods or services the magnitude of the quantity or estimated dollar value of which would render small business prime contract participation unlikely;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is a bundled or substantially bundled requirement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Is a consolidation of contract requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A written statement explaining why, if the proposed acquisition strategy involves a bundled or consolidated requirement, the procuring activity believes that the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified; the analysis required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; the acquisition plan; any bundling information required under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and any other relevant information. The PCR and agency OSDBU or OSBP, as applicable, must then work together to develop alternative acquisition strategies identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to enhance small business participation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All required clearances for the bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated requirement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A written statement explaining why--if the description of the requirement includes goods or services currently being performed by a small business and the magnitude of the quantity or estimated dollar value of the proposed procurement would render small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Delivery schedules cannot be established on a basis that will encourage small business participation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Construction cannot be procured through separate discrete projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procuring Agency Small Business Specialist (SBS) Responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As early in the acquisition planning process as practicable--but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, or prior to placing an order without a solicitation--the procuring activity must coordinate with the procuring activity's SBS when the acquisition strategy contemplates an acquisition meeting the dollar amounts set forth for substantial bundling. If the acquisition strategy contemplates Multiple Award Contracts or orders under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program or a task or delivery order contract awarded by another agency, these thresholds apply to the cumulative estimated value of the Multiple Award Contracts or orders, including options. The procuring activity is not required to coordinate with its SBS if the contract or order is entirely set-aside for small business concerns, or small businesses under one of SBA's small business programs, as authorized under the Small Business Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The SBS must notify the agency OSDBU or OSBP if the agency's acquisition strategy or plan includes bundled or consolidated requirements that the agency has not identified as bundled, or includes unnecessary or unjustified bundling of requirements. If the strategy involves substantial bundling, the SBS must assist in identifying alternative strategies that would reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The SBS must coordinate with the procuring activity and PCR on all required determinations and findings for bundling and/or consolidation, and acquisition planning and strategy documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> OSDBU and OSBP Oversight Functions. The Agency OSDBU or OSBP must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conduct annual reviews to assess the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Extent to which small businesses are receiving their fair share of Federal procurements, including contract opportunities under programs administered under the Small Business Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adequacy of the bundling or consolidation documentation and justification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Adequacy of actions taken to mitigate the effects of necessary and justified contract bundling or consolidation on small businesses (e.g., review agency oversight of prime contractor subcontracting plan compliance under the subcontracting program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide a copy of the assessment under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to the agency head and SBA's Administrator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify proposed solicitations that involve significant bundling of contract requirements, and work with the agency acquisition officials and the SBA to revise the procurement strategies for such proposed solicitations to increase the probability of participation by small businesses as prime contractors through Small Business Teaming Arrangements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Facilitate small business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a solicitation for a substantially bundled contract is to be issued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assist small business concerns to obtain payments, required late payment interest penalties, or information regarding payments due to such concerns from an executive agency or a contractor, in conformity with chapter 39 of Title 31 or any other protection for contractors or subcontractors (including suppliers) that is included in the FAR or any individual agency supplement to such Government-wide regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Cooperate, and consult on a regular basis with the SBA with respect to carrying out these functions and duties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Make recommendations to contracting officers as to whether a particular contract requirement should be awarded to any type of small business.

The Contracting Officer must document any reason not to accept such recommendations and include the documentation in the appropriate contract file; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Coordinate on any acquisition planning and strategy documentation, including bundling and consolidation determinations at the agency level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Communication on Achieving Goals. All Senior Procurement Executives, senior program managers, Directors of OSDBU or Directors of OSBP must communicate to their subordinates the importance of achieving small business goals and ensuring that a fair proportion of awards are made to small businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contract Consolidation and Bundling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Limitation on the Use of Consolidated Contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An agency may not conduct an acquisition that is a consolidation of contract requirements unless the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer for the Federal agency, before carrying out the acquisition strategy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Conducts adequate market research;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Makes a written determination, which is coordinated with the agency's OSDBU/OSBP, that the consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Identifies any negative impact by the acquisition strategy on contracting with small business concerns; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Ensures that steps will be taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A consolidation of contract requirements may be necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to: benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options) where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or benefits equivalent to 5 percent of the contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, where the contract or order value exceeds $94 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the expected total amount of the cost savings, as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer, is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement. To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each agency must ensure that any decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the consolidated requirement is also considered a bundled requirement, then the contracting officer must instead follow the provisions regarding bundling set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on the Use of Contract Bundling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the procuring activity intends to proceed with an acquisition involving bundled or substantially bundled procurement requirements, it must document the acquisition strategy to include a determination that the bundling is necessary and justified, when compared to the benefits that could be derived from meeting the agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A bundled requirement is necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that the procuring activity would derive from contracting to meet those requirements if not bundled, it would derive measurably substantial benefits. The procuring activity must quantify the identified benefits and explain how their impact would be measurably substantial. The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options), where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Benefits equivalent to 5 percent of the contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, where the contract or order value exceeds $94 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the Senior Procurement Executives or the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology (for other Defense Agencies) in the Department of Defense and the Deputy Secretary or equivalent in civilian agencies may, on a non-delegable basis, determine that a bundled requirement is necessary and justified when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There are benefits that do not meet the thresholds set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section but, in the aggregate, are critical to the agency's mission success; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The procurement strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone must not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the administrative or personnel cost savings are expected to be substantial, in relation to the dollar value of the procurement to be bundled (including options). To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In assessing whether cost savings and/or a price reduction would be achieved through bundling, the procuring activity and SBA must compare the price that has been charged by small businesses for the work that they have performed and, where available, the price that could have been or could be charged by small businesses for the work not previously performed by small business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The substantial benefit analysis set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is still required where a requirement is subject to a Cost Comparison Analysis under OMB Circular A-76.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on the Use of Substantial Bundling. Where a proposed procurement strategy involves a Substantial Bundling of contract requirements, the procuring agency must, in the documentation of that strategy, include a determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use, and must include, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The analysis for bundled requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that will result from the substantial bundling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Actions designed to maximize small business participation as prime contractors, including provisions that encourage small business teaming for the substantially bundled requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at any tier under the contract or contracts that may be awarded to meet the requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The identification of the alternative strategies that would reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling, and the rationale for not choosing those alternatives (i.e., consider the strategies under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Significant Subcontracting Opportunities in Justified Consolidated, Bundled and Substantially Bundled Requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where a justified consolidated, bundled, or substantially bundled requirement offers a significant opportunity for subcontracting, the procuring agency must designate the following factors as significant factors in evaluating offers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A factor that is based on the rate of participation provided under the subcontracting plan for small business in the performance of the contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the evaluation of past performance of an offeror, a factor that is based on the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation in the performance of contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the offeror for such a contract qualifies as a small business concern, the procuring agency must give to the offeror the highest score possible for the evaluation factors identified above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notification to Current Small Business Contractors of Intent to Bundle. The procuring activity must notify each small business which is performing a contract that it intends to bundle that requirement with one or more other requirements at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation for the bundled or substantially bundled requirement. The procuring activity, at that time, should also provide to the small business the name, phone number and address of the applicable SBA PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located). This notification must be documented in the contract file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notification to Public of Rationale for Bundled Requirement. The head of a Federal agency must publish on the agency's Web site a list and rationale for any bundled requirement for which the agency solicited offers or issued an award. The notification must be made within 30 days of the agency's data certification regarding the validity and verification of data entered in that Federal Procurement Data Base to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. However, to foster transparency in Federal procurement, the agency is encouraged to provide such notification before issuance of the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Notification to SBA of Recompeted Bundled or Consolidated Requirement. For each bundled or consolidated contract that is to be recompeted (even if additional requirements have been added or deleted) the procuring agency must notify SBA's PCR as soon as possible but no later than 30 days prior to issuance of the solicitation of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of savings and benefits achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Multiple Award Contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer must set-aside a Multiple Award Contract if the requirements for a set-aside are met. This includes set-asides for small businesses, 8(a) Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer in his or her discretion may partially set-aside or reserve a Multiple Award Contract, or set aside, or preserve the right to set aside, orders against a Multiple Award Contract that was not itself set aside for small business. The ultimate decision of whether to use any of the above-mentioned tools in any given procurement action is a decision of the contracting agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The procuring agency contracting officer must document the contract file and explain why the procuring agency did not partially set-aside or reserve a Multiple Award Contract, or set-aside orders issued against a Multiple Award Contract, when these authorities could have been used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total Set-aside of Multiple Award Contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer must conduct market research to determine whether the ``rule of two'' can be met.

Sec. 125.3   What types of subcontracting assistance are available tosmall businesses?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The purpose of the subcontracting assistance program is to provide the maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns, including small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns, certified small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and

small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The subcontracting assistance program implements section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, which includes the requirement that, unless otherwise exempt, other than small business concerns awarded contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities by the Federal Government in excess of $650,000, or in excess of $1,500,000 for construction of a public facility, must submit a subcontracting plan to the appropriate contracting agency. The Federal Acquisition Regulation sets forth the requirements for subcontracting plans in 48 CFR 19.7, and the clause at 48 CFR 52.219-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subcontract under this section means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies and/or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract (including modifications).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subcontract award data reported by prime contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made beyond the immediate next-tier, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian Tribe; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime contractor or subcontractor are not included in the subcontracting base. Subcontracts by first-tier affiliates shall be treated as subcontracts of the prime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Only subcontracts involving performance in the United States or its outlying areas should be included, with the exception of subcontracts under a contract awarded by the U.S. Department of State or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts performed outside the United States and its outlying areas and subcontracts for foreign military sales unless waived in accordance with agency regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following should not be included in the subcontracting base: internally generated costs such as salaries and wages; employee insurance; other employee benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease payments; bank fees; fines, claims, and dues; Original Equipment Manufacturer relationships during warranty periods (negotiated up front with product); utilities such as electricity, water, sewer, and other services purchased from a municipality or solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions. Utility companies may be eligible for additional exclusions unique to their industry, which may be approved by the contracting officer on a case-by-case basis. Exclusions from the subcontracting base include but are not limited to those listed above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subcontracting goals required under paragraph (c) of this section must be established in terms of the total dollars subcontracted and as a percentage of total subcontract dollars.

A prime contractor may submit a commercial plan, described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, instead of an individual subcontracting plan, when the product or service being furnished to the Government meets the definition of a commercial item under 48 CFR 2.101;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Making a good-faith effort to achieve the dollar and percentage goals and other elements in its subcontracting plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contractor may not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing any material matter pertaining to payment or utilization with the contracting officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When developing an individual subcontracting plan (also called individual contract plan), the contractor must decide whether to include indirect costs in its subcontracting goals. If indirect costs are included in the goals, these costs must be included in the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR) in www.esrs.gov (eSRS) or Subcontract Reports for Individual Contracts (the paper SF-294, if authorized). If indirect costs are excluded from the goals, these costs must be excluded from the ISRs (or SF-294 if authorized); however, these costs must be included on a prorated basis in the Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) in the eSRS system. A contractor authorized to use a commercial subcontracting plan must include all indirect costs in its SSR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The contractor must assign each subcontract the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the

subcontract (see Sec. 121.410). The prime contractor may rely on subcontractor self-certifications made in SAM (or any successor system), if the subcontract contains a clause which provides that the subcontractor verifies by submission of the offer that the size or socioeconomic representations and certifications in SAM (or any successor system) are current, accurate and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontract. A prime contractor or subcontractor may not require the use of SAM (or any successor system) for purposes of representing size or socioeconomic status in connection with a subcontract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The contractor must submit timely and accurate ISRs and SSRs in eSRS (or any successor system), or if information for a particular procurement cannot be entered into eSRS (or any successor system), submit a timely SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contract. When a report is rejected by the contracting officer, the contractor must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the report within 30 days of receiving the notice of rejection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The contractor must cooperate in the reviews of subcontracting plan compliance, including providing requested information and supporting documentation reflecting actual achievements and good-faith efforts to meet the goals and other elements in the subcontracting plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The contractor must provide pre-award written notification to unsuccessful small business offerors on all subcontracts over $150,000 for which a small business concern received a preference.

A commercial plan covers the offeror's fiscal year and applies to the entire production of commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line). Once approved, the plan remains in effect during the contractor's fiscal year for all Federal government contracts in effect during that period. The contracting officer of the agency that originally approved the commercial plan will exercise the functions of the contracting officer on behalf of all agencies that award contracts covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An offeror must represent to the contracting officer that it will make a good faith effort to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials, or obtain the performance of construction work from the small business concerns that it used in preparing the bid or proposal, in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal. Merely responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or offer. An offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The offeror references the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The offeror has a subcontract or agreement in principle to subcontract with the small business concern to perform a portion of the specific contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The small business concern drafted any portion of the bid or proposal or the offeror used the small business concern's pricing or cost information or technical expertise in preparing the bid or proposal, where there is written evidence (including email) of an intent or understanding that the small business concern will be awarded a subcontract for the related work if the offeror is awarded the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a prime contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies,

services or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in (c)(3), the prime contractor must provide the contracting officer with a written explanation. This written explanation must be submitted to the contracting officer prior to the submission of the invoice for final payment and contract close-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A prime contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing if upon completion of the responsibilities of the small business subcontractor (i.e., the subcontractor is entitled to payment under the terms of the subcontract), the prime contractor pays a reduced price to a small business subcontractor for goods and services provided for the contract or the payment to a small business subcontractor is more than 90 days past due under the terms of the subcontract for goods and services provided for the contract and for which the Federal agency has paid the prime contractor. ``Reduced price'' means a price that is less than the price agreed upon in a written, binding contractual document. The prime contractor shall include the reason for the reduction in payment to or failure to pay a small business subcontractor in any written notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If at the conclusion of a contract the prime contractor did not meet all of the small business subcontracting goals in the subcontracting plan, the prime contractor shall provide the contracting officer with a written explanation as to why it did not meet the goals of the plan so that the contracting officer can evaluate whether the prime contractor acted in good faith as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The additional prime contractor responsibilities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The prime contractor is a small business concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The prime contract or contract modification is a personal services contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The prime contract or contract modification will be performed entirely outside of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contracting officer responsibilities. The contracting officer (or administrative contracting officer if specifically delegated in writing to accomplish this task) is responsible for evaluating the prime contractor's compliance with its subcontracting plan, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensuring that all contractors submit their subcontracting reports into the eSRS (or any successor system) or, if applicable, the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, within 30 days after the report ending date (e.g., by October 30th for the fiscal year ended September 30th).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing all ISRs, and where applicable, SSRs, in eSRS (or any successor system) within 60 days of the report ending date (e.g., by November 30th for a report submitted for the fiscal year ended September 30th) and either accepting or rejecting the reports in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions set forth in 48 CFR subpart 19.7, 52.219-9, and the eSRS instructions (www.esrs.gov). The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the contracting officer who approved the commercial plan. If a report is rejected, the contracting officer must provide an explanation for the rejection to allow prime contractors the opportunity to respond specifically to perceived deficiencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan. Evidence that a large business prime contractor has made a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan or other subcontracting responsibilities includes supporting documentation that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contractor performed one or more of the actions described in paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate for the procurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the contractor may have failed to achieve its goal in one socioeconomic category, it over-achieved its goal by an equal or greater amount in one or more of the other categories; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contractor fulfilled all of the requirements of its subcontracting plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Evaluating the prime contractor's written explanation concerning the

prime contractor's failure to use a small business concern in performance in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal, and considering that information when rating the contractor for past performance purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Evaluating the prime contractor's written explanation concerning its payment of a reduced price to a small business subcontractor for goods and services upon completion of the responsibilities of the subcontractor or its payment to a subcontractor more than 90 days past due under the terms of the subcontract for goods and services provided for the contract and for which the Federal agency has paid the prime contractor, and considering that information when rating the contractor for past performance purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Evaluating whether the prime contractor has a history of unjustified untimely or reduced payments to subcontractors, and if so, recording the identity of the prime contractor in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), or any successor database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In his or her discretion, requiring the prime contractor (other than a prime contractor with a commercial plan) to update its subcontracting plan when an option is exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Requiring the prime contractor (other than a contractor with a commercial plan) to submit a subcontracting plan if the value of a modification causes the value of the contract to exceed the subcontracting plan threshold and to the extent that subcontracting opportunities exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> In his or her discretion, requiring a subcontracting plan if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Where a subcontracting plan is amended in connection with an option, or added as a result of a recertification or modification, the changes to any existing plan are for prospective subcontracting opportunities and do not apply retroactively. However, since achievements must be reported on the ISR (or the SF-294, if applicable) on a cumulative basis from the inception of the contract, the contractor's achievements prior to the modification or option will be factored into its overall achievement on the contract from inception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> CMR Responsibilities. Commercial Market Representatives (CMRs) are SBA's subcontracting specialists. CMRs are responsible for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Facilitating the matching of large prime contractors with small business concerns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Counseling large prime contractors on their responsibilities to maximize subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Instructing large prime contractors on identifying small business concerns by means of SAM (or any successor system), SUB-Net, Business Matchmaking events, and other resources and tools;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Counseling small business concerns on how to market themselves to large prime contractors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Maintaining a portfolio of large prime contractors and conducting Subcontracting Orientation and Assistance Reviews (SOARs). SOARs are conducted for the purpose of assisting prime contractors in understanding and complying with their small business subcontracting responsibilities, including developing subcontracting goals that reflect maximum practicable opportunity for small business; maintaining acceptable books and records; and periodically submitting reports to the Federal government; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conducting periodic reviews, including compliance reviews in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Compliance reviews. (1) A prime contractor's performance under its subcontracting plan is evaluated by means of on-site compliance reviews and follow-up reviews. A compliance review is a surveillance review that determines a contractor's achievements in meeting the goals and other elements in its subcontracting plan for both open contracts and contracts completed during the previous twelve months. A follow-up review is done after a compliance review, generally within six to eight months, to determine if the contractor has implemented SBA's recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A prime contractor's performance under its subcontracting plan is evaluated by means of on-site compliance reviews and follow-up reviews. A compliance review is a surveillance review that determines a contractor's achievements in meeting the goals and other elements in its subcontracting plan for both open contracts and contracts completed during the previous twelve months. A follow-up review is done after a compliance review, generally within six to eight months, to determine if the contractor has implemented SBA's recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All compliance reviews begin with a validation of the prime contractor's

most recent ISR (or SF-294, if applicable) or SSR. A compliance review includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An evaluation of whether the prime contractor assigned the proper NAICS code and corresponding size standard to a subcontract, and a review of whether small business subcontractors qualify for the size or socioeconomic status claimed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Validation of the prime contractor's methodology for completing its subcontracting reports; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consideration of whether the prime contractor is monitoring its other than small subcontractors with regard to their subcontracting plans, determining achievement of their proposed subcontracting goals, and reviewing their subcontractors' ISRs (or SF-294s, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon completion of the review and evaluation of a contractor's performance and efforts to achieve the requirements in its subcontracting plans, the contractor's performance will be assigned one of the following ratings: Outstanding, Highly Successful, Acceptable, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory. The factors listed in paragraph (c) of this section will be taken into consideration, where applicable, in determining the contractor's rating. However, a contractor may be found Unsatisfactory, regardless of other factors, if it cannot substantiate the claimed achievements under its subcontracting plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any contractor that receives a marginal or unsatisfactory rating must provide a written corrective action plan to SBA, or to both SBA and the agency that conducted the compliance review if the agency conducting the review has an agreement with SBA, within 30 days of its receipt of the official compliance report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any contractor that fails to comply with paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or any contractor that fails to demonstrate a good-faith effort, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, may be considered for liquidated damages under the procedures in 48 CFR 19.705-7 and the clause at 52.219-16. This action shall be considered by the contracting officer upon receipt of a written recommendation to that effect from the CMR. The CMR's recommendation must include a copy of the compliance report and any other relevant correspondence or supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reviews and evaluations of contractors with commercial plans are identical to reviews and evaluations of other contractors, except that contractors with commercial subcontracting plans do not submit the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts. Instead, goal achievement is determined by comparing the goals in the approved commercial subcontracting plan against the cumulative achievements on the SF-295, Summary Subcontract Report, for the same period. The same ratings criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section apply to contractors with commercial plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> SBA is authorized to enter into agreements with other Federal agencies or entities to conduct compliance reviews and otherwise further the objectives of the subcontracting program. Copies of these agreements will be published on http://www.sba.gov/GC. SBA is the lead agency on all joint compliance reviews with other agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Subcontracting consideration in source selection. (1) A contracting officer may include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A contracting officer may include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offeror's proposed approach to small business subcontracting participation in the subject procurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting plan goals on previous covered contracts; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the offeror timely paid its small business subcontractors under covered contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer may include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates an offeror's commitment to pay small business subcontractors within a specific number of days after receipt of payment from the Government for goods and services previously rendered by the small business subcontractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer will comparatively evaluate the proposed timelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such a commitment shall become a material part of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contracting officer must consider the contractor's compliance

with the commitment in evaluating performance, including for purposes of contract continuation (such as exercising options).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A small business concern submitting an offer shall receive the maximum score, credit or rating under an evaluation factor described in paragraph (g) of this section without having to submit any information in connection with this factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A contracting officer shall include a significant evaluation factor for the criteria described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section in a bundled contract or order as defined in Sec. 125.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Paragraph (g) of this section may apply to solicitations for orders against multiple award contracts, (including a Federal Supply Schedule or Multiple Award Schedule contract, a Government-wide acquisition contract (GWAC), or a multi-agency contract (MAC)), blanket purchase agreements or basic ordering agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Multiple award contracts. (1) Except where a prime contractor has a commercial plan, the contracting officer shall require a subcontracting plan for each multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract (including Multiple Award Schedule), where the estimated value of the contract exceeds the subcontracting plan thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section and the contract has subcontracting opportunities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except where a prime contractor has a commercial plan, the contracting officer shall require a subcontracting plan for each multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract (including Multiple Award Schedule), where the estimated value of the contract exceeds the subcontracting plan thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section and the contract has subcontracting opportunities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contractors shall submit small business subcontracting reports for individual orders to the contracting agency on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The agency funding the order shall receive credit towards its small business subcontracting goals.
