Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the DRG changes are effective prospectively with discharges occurring on or after the same date the payment rates are effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for changes in the DRG classification system. All changes in the DRG classification system are made using the principles established for the DRG system. This means that cases are classified so each DRG is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clinically coherent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Embraces an acceptable range of resource consumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interim coverage changes--(1) Criteria.

The change is also published for public information in the next annual notice of changes to the DRG classification system published in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review by ProPAC. Changes published annually in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section are subject to review and comment by ProPAC upon publication.
