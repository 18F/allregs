                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each manufacturer, except as specified in Sec. 583.5 (f) and  (g), shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian Parts Content for each  carline on a model year basis. This determination shall be made before  the beginning of each model year. Items of equipment produced at the  final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in  the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied supplier. All  value otherwise added at the final assembly point and beyond, including  all final assembly costs, is excluded from the calculation of U.S./ Canadian parts content. The country of origin of nuts, bolts, clips,  screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate rinse,  windshield washer fluid, fasteners, tire assembly fluid, rivets,  adhesives, grommets, and wheel weights, used in final assembly of the  vehicle, is considered to be the country where final assembly of the  vehicle takes place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining the value of items of equipment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For items of  equipment received at the final assembly point, the value is the price  paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as delivered to the final  assembly point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but  not as   part of final assembly), the value is the fair market price that a  manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such  equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For items of equipment received at the factory or plant of an  allied supplier, the value is the price paid by the allied supplier for  the equipment as delivered to its factory or plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items  of equipment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Equipment supplied by an outside supplier to a  manufacturer or allied supplier is considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if 70 percent or more of its value is  added in the United States and/or Canada; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To otherwise have the actual percent of its value added in the  United States and/or Canada, rounded to the nearest five percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which an item of equipment supplied by an allied  supplier is considered U.S./Canadian is determined by dividing the value  added in the United States and/or Canada by the total value of the  equipment. The resulting number is multiplied by 100 to determine the  percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In determining the value added in the United States and/or  Canada of equipment supplied by an allied supplier, any equipment that  is delivered to the allied supplier by an outside supplier and is  incorporated into the allied supplier's equipment, is considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if at least 70 percent of its value  is added in the United States and/or Canada; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To otherwise have the actual percent of its value added in the  United States and/or Canada, rounded to the nearest five percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Value added in the United States and/or Canada by an allied  supplier or outside supplier includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The value added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials used by  the supplier, determined according to (4)(ii) for outside suppliers and  (4)(iii) for allied suppliers, plus,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For passenger motor vehicle equipment assembled or produced in  the U.S. or Canada, the value of the difference between the price paid  by the manufacturer or allied supplier for the equipment, as delivered  to its factory or plant, and the total value of the materials in the  equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Outside suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment will  determine the value added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials in the  equipment as specified in paragraphs (A) and (B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> For any material used by the supplier which was produced or  assembled in the U.S. or Canada, the supplier will subtract from the  total value of the material any value that was not added in the U.S.  and/or Canada. The determination of the value that was not added in the  U.S. and/or Canada shall be a good faith estimate based on information  that is available to the supplier, e.g., information in its records,  information it can obtain from its suppliers, the supplier's knowledge  of manufacturing processes, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The supplier shall consider the amount of value added and the  location in which that value was added--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At each earlier stage, counting from the time of receipt of a  material by the supplier, back to and including the two closest stages  each of which represented a substantial transformation into a new and  different product with a different name, character and use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value of materials used to produce a product in the  earliest of these two substantial transformation stages shall be treated  as value added in the country in which that stage occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For any material used by the supplier which was imported into  the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the  United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if  documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added  in the United States and/or Canada for that material (determined  according to the principles set forth in (A), such value added in the  United States and/or Canada is counted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allied suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment shall  determine the value that is added in the U.S. and/or Canada for  materials in the equipment in accordance with (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the minor items listed in the Sec. 583.4 definition of  ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being excluded   from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that  they incorporate such items into their equipment, treat the cost of the  minor items as value added in the country of assembly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the  territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada from a third  country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed  to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which  identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that  equipment (determined according to the principles set forth in the rest  of (c)(4)), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is  counted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The payment of duty does not result in value added in the  United States and/or Canada.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if a  manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or  more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular  equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered  zero. This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and  allied suppliers to request this information from their suppliers or the  obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a manufacturer or allied supplier requests information in a  timely manner from one or more of its outside suppliers concerning the  U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, but does not receive that  information despite a good faith effort to obtain it, the manufacturer  or allied supplier may make its own good faith value added  determinations, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer or allied supplier shall make the same value  added determinations as would be made by the outside supplier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer or allied supplier shall consider the amount  of value added and the location in which the value was added for all of  the stages that the outside supplier would be required to consider;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer or allied supplier may determine that  particular value is added in the United States and/or Canada only if it  has a good faith basis to make that determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer and its allied suppliers may, on a combined  basis, make value added determinations for no more than 10 percent, by  value, of a carline's total parts content from outside suppliers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Value added determinations made by a manufacturer or allied  supplier under this paragraph shall have the same effect as if they were  made by the outside supplier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> This provision does not affect the obligation of outside  suppliers to provide the requested information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value  of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment. The percentage of the  value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is U.S./ Canadian is determined by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adding the total value of all of the equipment (regardless of  country of origin) expected to be installed in that carline during the  next model year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such  equipment by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiplying the resulting number by 100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Alternative calculation procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may  submit a petition to use calculation procedures based on representative  or statistical sampling, as an alternative to the calculation procedures  specified in this section to determine U.S./Canadian parts content and  major sources of foreign parts content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each petition must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be submitted at least 120 days before the manufacturer would use  the alternative procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Be written in the English language;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Be submitted in three copies to: Administrator, National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW.,  Washington, DC 20590;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> State the full name and address of the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Set forth in full the data, views and arguments of the  manufacturer   that would support granting the petition, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> the alternative procedure, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> analysis demonstrating that the alternative procedure will  produce substantially equivalent results to the procedure set forth in  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Specify and segregate any part of the information and data  submitted in the petition that is requested to be withheld from public  disclosure in accordance with part 512 of this chapter (the basic  alternative procedure and basic supporting analysis must be provided as  public information, but confidential business information may also be  used in support of the petition).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The NHTSA publishes in the Federal Register, affording  opportunity for comment, a notice of each petition containing the  information required by this part. A copy of the petition is placed in  the public docket. However, if NHTSA finds that a petition does not  contain the information required by this part, it so informs the  petitioner, pointing out the areas of insufficiency and stating that the  petition will not receive further consideration until the required  information is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator determines that the petition does not  contain adequate justification, he or she denies it and notifies the  petitioner in writing, explaining the reasons for the denial. A copy of  the letter is placed in the public docket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the Administrator determines that the petition contains  adequate justification, he or she grants it, and notifies the petitioner  in writing. A copy of the letter is placed in the public docket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Administrator may attach such conditions as he or she deems  appropriate to a grant of a petition, which the manufacturer must follow  in order to use the alternative procedure.
