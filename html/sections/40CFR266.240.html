                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your LLMW will automatically lose the storage and treatment conditional exemption if you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in Sec.  266.230. When your LLMW loses the exemption, you must immediately manage that waste which failed the condition as RCRA hazardous waste, and the storage unit storing the LLMW immediately becomes subject to RCRA hazardous waste container and/or tank storage requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in Sec.  266.230 you must report to us and the NRC, or the oversight agency in the NRC Agreement State, in writing by certified delivery within 30 days of learning of the failure. Your report must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete. This report must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific condition(s) you failed to meet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the LLMW (including the waste name, hazardous waste codes and quantity) and storage location at the facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date(s) on which you failed to meet the condition(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the failure to meet any of the conditions may endanger human health or the environment, you must also immediately notify us orally within 24 hours and follow up with a written notification within five days. Failures that may endanger human health or the environment include, but are not limited to, discharge of a CERCLA reportable quantity or other leaking or exploding tanks or containers, or detection of radionuclides above background or hazardous constituents in the leachate collection system of a storage area. If the failure may endanger human health or the environment, you must follow the provisions of your emergency plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We may terminate your conditional exemption for your LLMW, or require you to meet additional conditions to claim a conditional exemption, for serious or repeated noncompliance with any requirement(s) of subpart N of this part.</p>
