                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If at the time of the initial execution of the Lease the Owner  wishes to collect a security deposit, the maximum amount shall be the  greater of one month's Total Tenant Payment or $50. However, this amount  shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under State or local law.  For units leased in place, security deposits collected prior to the  execution of a Contract which are in excess of this maximum amount do  not have to be refunded until the Family vacates the unit subject to the  lease terms. The Family is expected to pay security deposits and utility  deposits from its resources and/or other public or private sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a Family vacates the unit, the Owner, subject to State and  local law, may use the security deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid  Tenant Rent or other amount which the Family owes under the Lease. If a  Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease  consistent with State or local law or if such amount is less than the  amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount  or the unused balance to the Family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on  security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of  interest payable. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws  regarding interest payments on security deposits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the security deposit is insufficient to reimburse the Owner  for the unpaid Tenant Rent or other amounts which the Family owes under  the Lease, or if the Owner did not collect a security deposit, the Owner  may claim reimbursement from the PHA for an amount not to exceed the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount owed the Owner, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two month's Contract Rent; minus, in either case, the greater of  the security deposit actually collected or the amount of security  deposit the Owner could have collected under the program (pursuant to  paragraph (a) of this section). Any reimbursement under this section  must be applied first toward any unpaid Tenant Rent due under the Lease  and then to any other amounts owed. No reimbursement may be claimed for  unpaid rent for the period after the Family vacates.  [43 FR 61246, Dec. 29, 1978, as amended at 44 FR 31176, May 31, 1979; 49  FR 19945, May 10, 1984.
