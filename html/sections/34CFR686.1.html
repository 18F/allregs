                            <p class="depth0">The TEACH Grant program awards grants to students who intend to teach, to help meet the cost of their postsecondary education. In exchange for the grant, the student must agree to serve as a full-time teacher in a high-need field, in a school serving low-income students for at least four academic years within eight years of completing the program of study for which the student received the grant. If the student does not satisfy the service obligation, the amounts of the TEACH Grants received are treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan (Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan) and must be repaid with interest.
