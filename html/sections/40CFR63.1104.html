                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The provisions of this section provide calculation and  measurement methods for criteria that are required by Sec.  63.1103 to  be used to determine applicability of the control requirements for  process vents from continuous unit operations. The owner or operator of  a process vent is not required to determine the criteria specified for a  process vent that is being controlled (including control by flare) in  accordance with the applicable weight-percent, TOC concentration, or  organic HAP concentration requirement in Sec.  63.1103.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (4) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sampling site location if TRE determination is required. If the  applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of Sec.   63.1103 includes a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining  volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic  HAP or TOC concentration, heating value, and TRE index value, shall be  after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present)  but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior  to release to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling site location if TRE determination is not required. If  the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of Sec.   63.1103 does not include a TRE index value, the sampling site for  determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration,  total organic HAP or TOC concentration, and any other specified  parameter shall be at the exit from the unit operation before any  control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sampling site selection method. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part  60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the  sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process  vents smaller than 0.10 meter (0.33 foot) in nominal inside diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a  combustion device. An owner or operator using a scrubber to reduce the  process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms  per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in  compliance with   Sec.  63.1103 (as appropriate) shall determine the halogen atom mass  emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures  in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability assessment requirement. The TOC or organic HAP  concentrations, process vent volumetric flow rates, process vent heating  values, process vent TOC or organic HAP emission rates, halogenated  process vent determinations, process vent TRE index values, and  engineering assessments for process vent control applicability  assessment requirements are to be determined during maximum  representative operating conditions for the process, except as provided  in paragraph (d) of this section, or unless the Administrator specifies  or approves alternate operating conditions. For acrylic and modacrylic  fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected  sources, operations during periods of malfunction shall not constitute  representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test. For  all other affected sources, operations during periods of startup,  shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions  for the purpose of an applicability test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> through (3) to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Causing damage to equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does  not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess  of demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em>, or (k) of this section or any other method or  data that has been validated according to the protocol in method 301 of  appendix A of this part.

Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include  calculations based on material balances, process stoichiometry, or  previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the  current process vent conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The organic compound used as the calibration gas for Method  25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP  compound present at greater than 50 percent of the total organic HAP or  TOC by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The span value for Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A  shall be equal to the appropriate control applicability concentration  value specified in the applicable table(s) presented in Sec.  63.1103 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Use of Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if  the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times  the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas  when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the concentration  of TOC including methane and ethane measured by Method 25A of 40 CFR  part 60, appendix A is below one-half the appropriate control  applicability concentration specified in the applicable table for a  subject source category in Sec.  63.1103 in order to qualify for a low  organic HAP concentration exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> or  (2) of this section and shall be recorded as specified in Sec.   63.1109(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix  A, as appropriate.
