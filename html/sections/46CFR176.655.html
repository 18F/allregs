                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you use only divers for the underwater survey portion of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE), you must provide the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), with a written hull examination report. This report must include thickness gauging results, bearing clearances, a copy of the audio and video recordings, and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for a credit hull exam. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you use an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as the predominate means to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you must provide the OCMI with a report in a format that is acceptable to the OCMI, per Sec. 176.650(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The OCMI will evaluate the hull examination report and grant a credit hull exam if satisfied with the condition of the vessel. If approved and you exclusively use divers to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 36 months. (Underwater examinations are required twice every 5 years.) If approved and you use an underwater ROV as the predominate means to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 60 months (5 years).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At least 60 days prior to each scheduled underwater exam, the owner may request a waiver from the OCMI if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A satisfactory exam has been completed within the last three years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conditions during the last exam allowed at least 80 percent of the bottom surface to be viewed and recorded; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The results of the last exam indicated that an extended interval is safe and reasonable.
