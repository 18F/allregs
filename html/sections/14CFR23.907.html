For the purpose of this paragraph, the propeller includes the hub, blades, blade retention component and any other propeller component whose failure due to fatigue could be catastrophic to the airplane. This evaluation must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The intended loading spectra including all reasonably foreseeable propeller vibration and cyclic load patterns, identified emergency conditions, allowable overspeeds and overtorques, and the effects of temperatures and humidity expected in service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effects of airplane and propeller operating and airworthiness limitations.
