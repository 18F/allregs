                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When a notice of intent to terminate is filed with it, the PBGC--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will determine whether the notice was issued in compliance with Sec. 4041.43; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Will advise the plan administrator of its determination, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, no later than the proposed termination date specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tentative finding of compliance. If the PBGC determines that the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate appears to be in compliance with Sec. 4041.43, it will notify the plan administrator in writing that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PBGC has made a tentative determination of compliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The distress termination proceeding may continue; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After reviewing the distress termination notice filed pursuant to Sec. 4041.45, the PBGC will make final, or reverse, this tentative determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Finding of noncompliance. If the PBGC determines that the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate was not in compliance with Sec. 4041.43 (except for requirements that the PBGC elects to waive under Sec. 4041.41(b)(2)(i) with respect to the notice filed with the PBGC), the PBGC will notify the plan administrator in writing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the PBGC has determined that the notice of intent to terminate was not properly issued; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the proposed distress termination is null and void and the plan is an ongoing plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information on need to institute section 4042 proceedings. The PBGC may require the plan administrator to submit, within 20 days after the plan administrator's receipt of the PBGC's written request (or such other period as may be specified in such written request), any information that the PBGC determines it needs in order to decide whether to institute termination or trusteeship proceedings pursuant to section 4042 of ERISA, whenever--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A notice of intent to terminate indicates that benefits currently in pay status (or that should be in pay status) are not being paid or that this is likely to occur within the 180-day period following the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PBGC issues a determination under paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PBGC has any reason to believe that it may be necessary or appropriate to institute proceedings under section 4042 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reconsideration of finding of noncompliance. A plan administrator may request reconsideration of the PBGC's determination of noncompliance under paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with the rules prescribed in part 4003, subpart C, of this chapter. Any request for reconsideration automatically stays the effectiveness of the determination until the PBGC issues its decision on reconsideration, but does not stay the time period within which information must be submitted to the PBGC in response to a request under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice to affected parties. Upon a decision by the PBGC affirming a finding of noncompliance or upon the expiration of the period within which the plan administrator may request reconsideration of a finding of noncompliance (or, if earlier, upon the plan administrator's decision not to request reconsideration), the plan administrator must notify the affected parties (and any persons who were provided notice under Sec. 4041.43(e)) in writing that the plan is not going to terminate or, if applicable, that the termination is invalid but that a new notice of intent to terminate is being issued.</p>
