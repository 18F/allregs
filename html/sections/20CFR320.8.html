The notice shall explain the basis for the

denial of benefits and shall set forth what steps the claimant can take to contest the denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Communication of notice of denial. When the adjudicating office mails the denial notice to the claimant's address of record, it shall be considered that notice of the denial has been communicated to the claimant on the date of mailing such notice. If the adjudicating office has been notified that a claimant has an attorney or other representative helping him or her with the claim, a copy of the denial notice shall be sent to the attorney or such other representative.
