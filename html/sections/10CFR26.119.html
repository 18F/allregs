The MRO may perform this evaluation if the MRO has  the appropriate expertise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If another physician will perform the evaluation, the MRO shall  provide the other physician with the following information and  instructions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The donor was required to take a drug test, but was unable to  provide a sufficient quantity of urine to complete the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The potential consequences of refusing to take the required drug  test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The physician must agree to follow the requirements of  paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The physician who conducts this evaluation shall make one of the  following determinations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability  could have, precluded the donor from providing a sufficient amount of  urine; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is an inadequate basis for determining that a medical  condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have,  precluded the donor from providing a sufficient quantity of urine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this section, a medical condition includes an  ascertainable physiological condition (e.g., a urinary system  dysfunction) or a medically documented pre-existing psychological  disorder, but does not include unsupported assertions of ``situational  anxiety'' or dehydration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The physician who conducts this evaluation shall provide a  written   statement of his or her determination and the basis for it to the MRO.  This statement may not include detailed information on the donor's  medical condition beyond what is necessary to explain the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the physician who conducts this evaluation determines that  the donor's medical condition is a serious and permanent or long-term  disability that is highly likely to prevent the donor from providing a  sufficient amount of urine for a very long or indefinite period of time,  the physician shall set forth this determination and the reasons for it  in the written statement to the MRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The MRO shall seriously consider and assess the information  provided by the physician in deciding whether the donor has a medical  condition that has, or with a high degree of probability could have,  precluded the donor from providing a sufficient amount of urine, as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MRO concurs with the physician's determination, then the  MRO shall declare that the donor has not violated the FFD policy and the  licensee or other entity shall take no further action with respect to  the donor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the MRO determines that the medical condition has not, or  with a high degree of probability could not have, precluded the donor  from providing a sufficient amount of urine, then the MRO shall declare  that there has been a refusal to test; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the MRO determines that the medical condition is highly  likely to prevent the donor from providing a sufficient amount of urine  for a very long or indefinite period of time, then the MRO shall  authorize an alternative evaluation process, tailored to the individual  case, for drug testing.</p>
