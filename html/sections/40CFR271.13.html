When State law authorizes such continued operation it shall require compliance by owners and operators of such facilities with standards at least as stringent as EPA's interim status standards at 40 CFR part 265.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State must require all new HWM facilities to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number before commencing treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All permits issued by the State shall require compliance with the standards adopted by the State under Sec.  271.12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All permits issued under State law prior to the date of approval of final authorization shall be reviewed by the State Director and modified or revoked and reissued to require compliance with the requirements of this part.
