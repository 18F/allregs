You are not actively pursuing a final OTS determination if you have failed to timely take an action required under this part, including filing required additional information, or OTS has suspended processing of your application under Sec. 516.260 based

on circumstances that are, in whole or in part, within your control and you have failed to take reasonable steps to resolve these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section is effective July 1, 2001.</p>
