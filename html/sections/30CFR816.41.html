                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All surface mining and reclamation activities shall be  conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the  permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage to the hydrologic  balance outside the permit area, to assure the protection or replacement  of water rights, and to support approved postmining land uses in  accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved permit and the  performance standards of this part. The regulatory authority may require  additional preventative, remedial, or monitoring measures to assure that  material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area is  prevented. Mining and reclamation practices that minimize water  pollution and changes in flow shall be used in preference to water  treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ground-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic  balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the  plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth  materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other  harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations  and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants  into the ground water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ground-water quantity shall be protected by handling earth  materials and runoff in a manner that will restore the approximate  premining recharge capacity of the reclaimed area as a whole, excluding  coal mine waste disposal areas and fills, so as to allow the movement of  water to the ground-water system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ground-water monitoring. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ground-water monitoring shall be  conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under  Sec. 780.21(i) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require  additional monitoring when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months  to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the  regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical  results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the  analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the  permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the  regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in  Sec. Sec. 773.17(e) and 780.21(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and  continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the  procedures of Sec. 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may  modify the monitoring requirements, including the parameters covered and  the sampling frequency, if the operator demonstrates, using the  monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic  balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage  to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and  quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and the  water rights of other users have been protected or replaced; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set  forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 780.21(i) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjuction with  monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and offsite  shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be  removed by the operator when no longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Surface-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic  balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the  plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter, and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth  materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that  minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the  extent possible using the best technology currently available,  additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the  permit area; and otherwise prevents water pollution. If drainage  control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed   areas, diversion of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial  practices are not adequate to meet the requirements of this section and  Sec. 816.42, the operator shall use and maintain the necessary water- treatment facilities or water quality controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface-water quality and flow rates shall be protected by  handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps  outlined in the plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Surface-water monitoring. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface-water monitoring shall be  conducted according to the surface-water monitoring plan approved under  Sec. 780.21(j) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require  additional monitoring when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface-water monitoring data shcll be submitted every 3 months  to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the  regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical  results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the  analysis of any surface-water sample indicates noncompliance with the  permit conditions, the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory  authority and immediately take the actions provided for in Sec. Sec.  773.17(e) and 780.21(h) of this chapter. The reporting requirements of  this paragraph do not exempt the operator from meeting any National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surface-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and  continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with Sec.  774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the  monitoring requirements, except those required by the NPDES permitting  authority, including the parameters covered and sampling frequency if  the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this  paragraph, that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic  balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage  to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and  quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and the  water rights of other users have been protected or replaced; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set  forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 780.21(j) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction  with monitoring the quality and quantity of surface water onsite and  offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall  be removed by the operator when no longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Acid- and toxic-forming materials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drainage from acid- and  toxic-forming materials into surface water and ground water shall be  avoided by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifying and burying and/or treating, when necessary,  materials which may adversely affect water quality, or be detrimental to  vegetation or to public health and safety if not buried and/or treated,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Storing materials in a manner that will protect surface water  and ground water by preventing erosion, the formation of polluted  runoff, and the infiltration of polluted water. Storage shall be limited  to the period until burial and/or treatment first become feasible, and  so long as storage will not result in any risk of water pollution or  other environmental damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Storage, burial or treatment practices shall be consistent with  other material handling and disposal provisions of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer of wells. Before final release of bond, exploratory or  monitoring wells shall be sealed in a safe and environmentally sound  manner in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.13 to 816.15. With the prior  approval of the regulatory authority, wells may be transferred to  another party for further use. At a minimum, the conditions of such  transfer shall comply with State and local law and the permittee shall  remain responsible for the proper management of the well until bond  release in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.13 to 816.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Water rights and replacement. Any person who conducts surface  mining activities shall replace the water supply of an owner of interest  in real property who obtains all or part of his or   her supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other  legitimate use from an underground or surface source, where the water  supply has been adversely impacted by contamination, diminution, or  interruption proximately resulting from the surface mining activities.  Baseline hydrologic information required in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and 780.22  of this chapter shall be used to determine the extent of the impact of  mining upon ground water and surface water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Discharges into an underground mine. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discharges into an  underground mine are prohibited, unless specifically approved by the  regulatory authority after a demonstration that the discharge will--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance on the permit  area, prevent material damage outside the permit area and otherwise  eliminate public hazards resulting from surface mining activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not result in a violation of applicable water quality standards  or effluent limitations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be at a known rate and quality which shall meet the effluent  limitations of Sec. 816.42 for pH and total suspended solids, except  that the pH and total suspended-solids limitations may be exceeded, if  approved by the regulatory authority; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Meet with the approval of the Mine Safety and Health  Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discharges shall be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Coal processing waste;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fly ash from a coal-fired facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sludge from an acid-mine-drainage treatment facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Flue-gas desulfurization sludge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Inert materials used for stabilizing underground mines; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Underground mine development wastes.
