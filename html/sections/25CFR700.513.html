                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All employees shall conduct themselves on the job so as to efficiently discharge the work of the Commission. Employees shall observe courtesy, consideration and promptness in dealing with clients, other governmental agencies, and members of the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commission personnel conducting business with contractors, realtors, vendors, service providers and other public and private agencies, organizations, business and individuals shall maintain strict impartiality in their business dealings. Commission employees shall not allow themselves to be placed in a position in which a conflict of interest might arise or might justifiably be suspected. Such a conflict may arise or appear to arise by the acceptance of gratuities or by any action which could reasonably be interpreted as influencing the strict impartiality that must prevail in all business relationships involving the Commission. However, this requirement of impartiality is not intended to prohibit advocacy of client interests, as is required as a stated duty of certain agency positions. Such advocacy may occur for example during warrantee representation or during technical representation with builders.</p>
