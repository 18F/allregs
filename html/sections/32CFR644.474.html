                            <p class="depth0">DE's are designees of the Chief of Engineers under AR 405-90 to  determine the method of disposal authorized by law or regulations which  is most advantageous to the Government. Where alternatives are  presented, there will be an affirmative finding that the method of  disposal approved is most advantageous. In the exercise of this  authority, due consideration will be given to the effect of particular  methods of disposal on safety and sanitation in the area, the proposed  or probable future utilization of Government-owned sites by the  Government, or in the case of leased lands, the restoration obligations  of the Government under the lease. In order to assure consideration of  these factors, disposals by transfer to other Government agencies or by  sale intact will be brought to the attention of the installation  commander or his representative prior to initiation of disposal action.  Reasonable requirements for site clearance consistent with the foregoing  criteria should be favorably considered and disposal conditioned  accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that such action may result in a  greater burden to transferee agencies or, in the case of disposal by  sale intact, may result in a reduction in the monetary return which  might be reasonably expected in a sale involving less stringent site  clearance requirements. DAEN-REM will be informed of any instances of  excessive or unreasonable requirements with respect to site clearance.  The DE will determine by inspection and survey the method to be used in  disposal of buildings and improvements.</p>
