Repair of such equipment shall be complete by the end of the next shutdown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each vapor collection system or closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 minutes.
