The  Chief Counsel's advisory opinion shall not be binding upon a Presiding  Official conducting a proceeding under subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A statement made or advice provided by an FTA employee  constitutes an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under  this section. A statement or advice given by an FTA employee orally, or  given in writing, but not under this section, is an informal  communication that represents the best judgment of that employee at the  time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does not necessarily  represent the formal position of FTA, and does not bind or otherwise  obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.</p>
