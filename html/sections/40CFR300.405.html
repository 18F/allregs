If direct reporting to the NRC is not  practicable, reports may be made to the United States Coast Guard (USCG)  on-scene coordinator (OSC) for the geographic area where the release  occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the  regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports  shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify  the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made  immediately to the nearest USCG unit.
