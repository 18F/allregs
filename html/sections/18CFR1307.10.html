                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure  to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened  noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with  this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal  to grant or to continue financial assistance or by any other means  authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not to be  limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a  recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any  rights of the United States under any law of the United States, (2)  institution of appropriate proceedings by TVA to enforce the provisions  of the agreement of financial assistance or of any deed or   instrument relating thereto, and (3) any applicable proceeding under  State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 1307.7. If any entity requesting  financial assistance from TVA declines to furnish the assurance required  under Sec. 1307.7, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a  requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, financial assistance  may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of  this section; and for such purposes, the term ``recipient'' includes one  who has been denied financial assistance. TVA shall not be required to  provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the  administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that TVA shall  continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such  assistance was due and payable pursuant to an agreement therefor entered  into with TVA prior to the effective date of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial  assistance. No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or  continue financial assistance shall become effective until (1) TVA has  advised the recipient of the failure to comply and has determined that  compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an  express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a  failure by the recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or  pursuant to this part, including any act of discrimination on the basis  of handicap in violation of this part, and (3) the action has been  approved by the TVA Board pursuant to Sec. 1307.12. Any action to  suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue financial  assistance shall be limited to the particular recipient as to whom such  a finding had been made and shall be limited in its effect to the  particular program or activity, or part thereof, in which such  noncompliance had been so found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by  any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) TVA has  determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the  recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and  of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration  of at least ten (10) days from the mailing of such notice to the  recipient or other person. During this period of at least ten (10) days  additional efforts will be made to persuade the recipient or other  person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as  may be appropriate.
