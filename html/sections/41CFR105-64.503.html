                                Sec. 105-64.503  What is an accounting of disclosures?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The system manager maintains an account of each record disclosure  for five years or for the life of the record, whichever is longer. The  accounting of disclosure information includes the name of the person or  agency to whom your record has been provided, the date, the type of  information disclosed, and the reason for disclosure. Other pertinent  information, such as justifications for disclosure and any written  consent that you may have provided, is also included. No accounting  needs to be maintained for disclosures to GSA officials or employees in  the performance of their duties, or disclosures under the Freedom of  Information Act.</p>
