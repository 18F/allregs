                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each award document shall include terms and conditions that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Address programmatic requirements (e.g., a statement of work or other appropriate terms or conditions that describe the specific goals and objectives of the project). The grants officer shall develop such terms and conditions in coordination with program officials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide for the recipient's compliance with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pertinent Federal statutes or Executive orders that apply broadly to Federal or DoD assistance awards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any program-specific requirements that are prescribed in the program statute (see Sec. 22.210(a)(2)), or appropriation-specific requirements that are stated in the pertinent Congressional appropriations (see Sec. 22.515).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Pertinent portions of the DoDGARs or other Federal regulations, including those that implement the Federal statutes or Executive orders described in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the grants officer's instructions for post-award administration, for any matter where the post-award administration provisions in 32 CFR part 32, 33, or 34 give the grants officer options for handling the matter. For example, under 32 CFR 32.24(b), the grants officers must choose among possible methods for the recipient's disposition of program income. It is essential that the grants officer identify the option selected in each case, to provide clear instructions to the recipient and the grants officer responsible for post-award administration of the grant or cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To assist grants officers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appendix B to this part provides model clauses to implement certain Federal statutes, Executive orders, and regulations (see paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that frequently apply to DoD grants and cooperative agreements. Grants officers may incorporate the model clauses into award terms and conditions, as appropriate. It should be noted that Appendix B to this part is an aid, and not an exhaustive list of all requirements that apply in all cases. Depending on the circumstances of a given award, other statutes, Executive orders, or codified regulations also may apply (e.g., Appendix B to this part does not list program-specific requirements described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appendix C to this part is a list of administrative requirements that apply to awards to different types of recipients. It also identifies post-award administration issues that the grants officer must address in the award terms and conditions.</p>
