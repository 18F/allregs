Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material.
