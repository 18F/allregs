Samples of unroasted coffee that are transiting Hawaii or Puerto Rico as cargo and that remain on the carrier may proceed to a destination outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico without action by an inspector. Samples may be transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii only after an inspector determines that they are packaged to prevent the escape of any plant pests. Samples that are not packaged in this manner must be rewrapped or packaged in a manner prescribed by an inspector to prevent the escape of plant pests before the transshipment will be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other mail, cargo, and baggage shipments of articles covered by Sec. 319.73-2 arriving in Puerto Rico or Hawaii may not be unloaded or transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii and are subject to inspection and other applicable requirements of the Plant Safeguard Regulations (part 352 of this chapter).</p>
