                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After the board of directors has complied with Sec. 708a.3 and approves a conversion proposal, the credit union must provide written notice of its intent to convert to each member who is eligible to vote on the conversion. The notice to members must be submitted 90 calendar days, 60 calendar days, and 30 calendar days before the date of the membership vote on the conversion. A ballot must be included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice and only in the 30-day notice. A converting credit union may not distribute ballots with either the 90-day or 60-day notice, in any other written communications, or in person before the 30-day notice is sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The notice to members must adequately describe the purpose and subject matter of the vote to be taken at the special meeting or by submission of the written ballot. The notice must clearly inform members that they may vote at the special meeting or by submitting the written ballot. The notice must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice to members must adequately describe the purpose and subject matter of the vote to be taken at the special meeting or by submission of the written ballot. The notice must clearly inform members that they may vote at the special meeting or by submitting the written ballot. The notice must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notices that are submitted 90 and 60 days before the membership vote on the conversion must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot will be mailed together with another notice 30 days before the date of the membership vote on conversion. The notice submitted 30 days before the membership vote on the conversion must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot is included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of facilitating the member-to-member contact described in paragraph (f) of this section, the 90-day notice must indicate the number of credit union members eligible to vote on the conversion proposal and state how many members have agreed to accept communications from the credit union in electronic form. The 90-day notice must also include the information listed in paragraph (f)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The member ballot must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A brief description of the proposal (e.g., ``Proposal: Approval of the Plan of Charter Conversion by which (insert name of credit union) will convert its charter to that of a federal mutual savings bank.'');</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two blocks marked respectively as ``FOR'' and ``AGAINST;'' and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following language: ``A vote FOR the proposal means that you want your credit union to become a mutual savings bank. A vote AGAINST the proposal means that you want your credit union to remain a credit union.'' This language must be displayed in a clear and conspicuous fashion immediately beneath the FOR and AGAINST blocks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The ballot may also include voting instructions and the recommendation of the board of directors (i.e., ``Your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the Plan of Conversion'') but may not include any further information without the prior written approval of the Regional Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An adequate description of the purpose and subject matter of the member vote on conversion, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure that the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank could lead to members losing their ownership interests in the credit union if the mutual savings bank subsequently converts to a stock institution and the members do not become stockholders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how a conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect members' voting rights and if the

mutual savings bank intends to base voting rights on account balances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure of any conversion-related economic benefit a director or senior management official will or may receive including receipt of or an increase in compensation and an explanation of any foreseeable stock-related benefits associated with a subsequent conversion to a stock institution or mutual holding company structure. The explanation of stock-related benefits must include a comparison of the opportunities to acquire stock available to officials and employees with those opportunities available to the general membership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An affirmative statement that, at the time of conversion to a mutual savings bank, the credit union does or does not intend to convert to a stock institution or a mutual holding company structure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure of the estimated, itemized cost of the proposed conversion, including printing fees, postage fees, advertising, consulting and professional fees, legal fees, staff time, the cost of holding a special meeting, other costs of conducting the vote, and any other conversion-related expenses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect the institution's ability to make non-housing-related consumer loans because of a mutual savings bank's obligations to satisfy certain lending requirements as a mutual savings bank. This disclosure should specify possible reductions in some kinds of loans to members;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure that the National Credit Union Administration does not approve or disapprove of the conversion proposal or the reasons advanced in support of and the reasons against the proposal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank is likely to affect the availability of facilities and services. At a minimum, this disclosure should include the name and location of any branches, including shared branches, and automatic teller networks, to which members may lose access as a result of the conversion. This disclosure must be based on research and analysis completed before the date the board of directors votes to adopt the conversion proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> A converting credit union must provide the following disclosures in a clear and conspicuous fashion with the 90-, 60-, and 30-day notices it sends to its members regarding the conversion:

------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">IMPORTANT REGULATORY DISCLOSURE ABOUT YOUR VOTEThe National Credit Union Administration, the federal government agency</p><p class="depth3">that supervises credit unions, requires [insert name of credit union]</p><p class="depth3">to provide the following disclosures:1. LOSS OF CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP. A vote ``FOR'' the proposed</p><p class="depth3">conversion means you want your credit union to become a mutual savings</p><p class="depth3">bank. A vote ``AGAINST'' the proposed conversion means you want your</p><p class="depth3">credit union to remain a credit union.2. RATES ON LOANS AND SAVINGS. If your credit union converts to a bank,</p><p class="depth3">you may experience changes in your loan and savings rates. Available</p><p class="depth3">historic data indicates that, for most loan products, credit unions on</p><p class="depth3">average charge lower rates than banks. For most savings products,</p><p class="depth3">credit unions on average pay higher rates than banks.3. POTENTIAL PROFITS BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. Conversion to a mutual</p><p class="depth3">savings bank is often the first step in a two-step process to convert</p><p class="depth3">to a stock-issuing bank or holding company structure. In such a</p><p class="depth3">scenario, the officers and directors of the institution often profit by</p><p class="depth3">obtaining stock in excess of that available to other members.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This text must be placed in a box, must be the only text on the front side of a single piece of paper, and must be placed so that the member will see the text after reading the credit union's cover letter but before reading any other part of the member notice. The back side of the paper must be blank. A converting credit union may modify this text only with the prior written consent of the Regional Director and, in the case of a state-chartered credit

union, the appropriate state regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All written communications from a converting credit union to its members regarding the conversion must be written in a manner that is simple and easy to understand. Simple and easy to understand means the communications are written in plain language designed to be understood by ordinary consumers and use clear and concise sentences, paragraphs, and sections. For purposes of this part, examples of factors to be considered in determining whether a communication is in plain language and uses clear and concise sentences, paragraphs and sections include the use of short explanatory sentences; use of definite, concrete, everyday words; use of active voice; avoidance of multiple negatives; avoidance of legal and technical business terminology; avoidance of explanations that are imprecise and reasonably subject to different interpretations; and use of language that is not misleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> A converting credit union must mail or e-mail a requesting member's proper conversion-related materials to other members eligible to vote if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A converting credit union must mail or e-mail a requesting member's proper conversion-related materials to other members eligible to vote if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A credit union's board of directors has adopted a proposal to convert;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A member makes a written request that the credit union mail or e-mail materials for the member;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The request is received by the credit union no later than 35 days after it sends out the 90-day member notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The requesting member agrees to reimburse the credit union for the reasonable expenses, excluding overhead, of mailing or e-mailing the materials and also provides the credit union with an appropriate advance payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A member's request must indicate if the member wants the materials mailed or e-mailed. If a member requests that the materials be mailed, the credit union will mail the materials to all eligible voters. If a member requests the materials be e-mailed, the credit union will e-mail the materials to all members who have agreed to accept communications electronically from the credit union. The subject line of the credit union's e-mail will be ``Proposed Credit Union Conversion to a Bank--Views of Member (insert member name).''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> (i) A converting credit union may, at its option, include the following statement with a member's material:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A converting credit union may, at its option, include the following statement with a member's material:</p><p class="depth4">On (date), the board of directors of (name of converting credit union) adopted a proposal to convert from a credit union to a mutual savings bank. Credit union members who wish to express their opinions about the proposed conversion to other members may provide those opinions to (name of credit union). By law, the credit union, at the requesting members' expense, must then send those opinions to the other members. The attached document represents the opinion of a member of this credit union. This opinion is a personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect the views of the management or directors of the credit union.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A converting credit union may not add anything other than this statement to a member's material without the prior approval of the Regional Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term ``proper conversion-related materials'' does not include materials that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Due to size or similar reasons are impracticable to mail or e-mail;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are false or misleading with respect to any material fact;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Omit a material fact necessary to make the statements in the material not false or misleading;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Relate to a personal claim or a personal grievance, or solicit personal gain or business advantage by or on behalf of any party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Relate to any matter, including a general economic, political, racial, religious, social, or similar cause, that is not significantly related to the proposed conversion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation impugn a person's character, integrity, or reputation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation make charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation make statements impugning the stability and soundness of the credit union.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a converting credit union believes some or all of a member's request is not proper it must submit the

member materials to the Regional Director within seven days of receipt. The credit union must include with its transmittal letter a specific statement of why the materials are not proper and a specific recommendation for how the materials should be modified, if possible, to make them proper. The Regional Director will review the communication, communicate with the requesting member, and respond to the credit union within seven days with a determination on the propriety of the materials. The credit union must then immediately mail or e-mail the material to the members if so directed by NCUA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A credit union must ensure that its members receive all materials that meet the requirements of Sec. 708a.4(f) on or before the date the members receive the 30-day notice and associated ballot. If a credit union cannot meet this delivery requirement, it must postpone mailing the 30-day notice until it can deliver the member materials. If a credit union postpones the mailing of the 30-day notice, it must also postpone the special meeting by the same number of days. When the credit union has completed the delivery, it must inform the requesting member that the delivery was completed and provide the number of recipients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The term ``appropriate advance payment'' means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For requests to mail materials to all eligible voters, a payment in the amount of 150% of the first class postage rate times the number of mailings, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For requests to e-mail materials only to members that have agreed to accept electronic communications, a payment in the amount of 200 dollars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a credit union posts conversion-related information or material on its Web site, then it must simultaneously make a portion of its Web site available free of charge to its members to post and share their opinions on the conversion. A link to the portion of the Web site available to members to post their views on the conversion must be marked ``Members: Share your views on the proposed conversion and see other members views'' and the link must also be visible on all pages on which the credit union posts its own conversion-related information or material, as well as on the credit union's homepage. If a credit union believes a particular member submission is not proper for posting, it will provide that submission to the Regional Director for review as described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. The credit union may also post a content-neutral disclaimer using language similar to the language in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A converting credit union must inform members with the 90-day notice that if they wish to provide their opinions about the proposed conversion to other members they can submit their opinions in writing to the credit union no later than 35 days from the date of the notice and the credit union will forward those opinions to other members. The 90-day notice will provide a contact at the credit union for delivery of communications, will explain that members must agree to reimburse the credit union's costs of transmitting the communication including providing an advance payment, and will refer members to this section of NCUA's rules for further information about the communication process. The credit union, at its option, may include additional factual information about the communication process with its 90-day notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A group of members may make a joint request that the credit union send its materials to other members. For purposes of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, the credit union will use the group name provided by the group.
