                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to Executive Order 11296, 10 August 1966, the DE having civil works responsibility for the area where property proposed for disposal is located will evaluate the property (civil or military) for the presence of flood hazards. If such hazards are found, a report will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM) recommending appropriate restrictions with respect to future uses of the property, or that the property be withheld from disposal. If decision is made to proceed with disposal, detailed information regarding the flood hazard will be reported to GSA on SF 118 as required by FPMR, 101-47.202-2, with the appropriate restrictions with respect to use of the property by a purchaser and his successors. (See ER 1105-2-40 for information on the Flood Plain Management Services Program.)</p>
