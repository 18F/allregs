                            <p class="depth0">The siting provisions establish the framework for the implementation of the siting process specified in Sec. 960.3-2. Sections 960.3-1-1 and 960.3-1-2 require that consideration be given to sites situated in different geohydrologic settings and different types of host rock, respectively. These diversity guidelines are intended to balance the process of site selection by requiring consideration of a variety of geologic conditions and media, and thereby enhance confidence in the technical suitability of sites selected for the development of repositories. As required by the Act, Sec. 960.3-1-3 specifies consideration of a regional distribution of repositories after recommendation of a site for development of the first repository. Section 960.3-1-4 describes the evidence that is required to support siting decisions. Section 960.3-1-5 establishes the basis for site evaluations against the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines of subparts C and D during the various phases of the siting process.</p>
