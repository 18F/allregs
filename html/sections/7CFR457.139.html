Annual Premium</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount for each cultural practice (e.g., fall transplanted irrigated) is determined by multiplying the final stage amount of insurance per acre by the premium rate for the cultural practice as

established in the Actuarial Table, by the insured acreage, by your share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the field grown mature green or ripe fresh market tomato types in the county as specified in the Special Provisions for which a premium rate is provided in the actuarial documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Planted to be harvested and sold as fresh market tomatoes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planted within the planting periods designated in the actuarial documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grown under an irrigated practice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Grown on acreage covered by plastic mulch except where the Special Provisions allows otherwise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Grown by a person who in at least one of the three previous crop years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grew tomatoes for commercial sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participated in managing a fresh market tomato farming operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That are not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interplanted with another crop;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planted into an established grass or legume;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grown for direct marketing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Direct seeded fresh market tomatoes, unless insured by written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">9. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In lieu of the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, that prohibit insurance attaching if a crop has not been planted in at least one of the three previous crop years, we will insure newly cleared land and former pasture land planted to fresh market tomatoes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must replant any acreage of tomatoes damaged during the planting period in which initial planting took place whenever less than 50 percent of the plant stand remains: and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is practical to replant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, at the time the crop was damaged, the final day of the planting period has not passed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The damage occurs within 30 days of transplanting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whenever tomatoes initially are planted during the fall or winter planting periods and the conditions specified in sections 9(b)(1) (ii) and (iii) are not met, you may elect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will continue for such replanted acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage. However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable in the subsequent planting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We will not insure any acreage on which tomatoes (except for replanted tomatoes in accordance with sections 9(b)(1) and (2)), peppers, eggplants, strawberries or tobacco have been grown and the soil was not fumigated or otherwise properly treated before planting the insured tomatoes.</p><p class="depth0">10. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit the later of the date we accept your application, or when the tomatoes are planted in each planting period. Coverage ends on each unit at the earliest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Total destruction of the tomatoes on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Abandonment of the tomatoes on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date harvest should have started on the unit on any acreage which will not be harvested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Final harvest on the unit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period that is 125 days after the date of transplanting or replanting with transplants.</p><p class="depth0">11. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Excess rain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Freeze;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hail;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tornado;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tropical depression; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disease or insect infestation, unless no effective control measure exists for such disease or insect infestation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to harvest in a timely manner or failure to sell the tomatoes, unless such failure is due to actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period. For example, we will not pay an indemnity if you are

unable to sell the insured crop due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</p><p class="depth0">12. Replanting Payments</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed if, due to an insured cause of loss, more than 50 percent of the plant stand will not produce tomatoes and it is practical to replant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the Special Provisions by your insured share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions, that limit a replanting payment to one each crop year, only one replanting payment will be made for acreage planted during each planting period within the crop year.</p><p class="depth0">13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit you must also give us notice not later than 72 hours after the earliest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit will not be harvested; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.</p><p class="depth0">14. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of insurance per acre for the final stage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage for the applicable stage (see section 3(d));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Total the results of section 14(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subtracting either of the following values from the result of section 14(b)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of multiplying the total value of production to count determined in accordance with section 14(c) by the percentage contained in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------For Example: You have a 100 percent share in 10.0 acres of fresh market</p><p class="depth0">tomatoes. You select a 70% coverage level of the reference maximum</p><p class="depth0">dollar amount of $7,500 per acre. The average price received is $10.00</p><p class="depth0">per carton of tomatoes. Allowable costs are $4.25 per carton. Minimum</p><p class="depth0">value is $5.00 per carton. Your total sold production is 5,000 cartons</p><p class="depth0">(5,000 / 10.0 = 500 cartons per acre) and you have an additional 1,000</p><p class="depth0">cartons of unsold harvested production (1,000 / 10.0 = 100 cartons per</p><p class="depth0">acre).

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop.
