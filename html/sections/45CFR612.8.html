                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information obtained by the Foundation from  a submitter of that information will be disclosed under the FOIA only  under this section's procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business Information means commercial or financial information  obtained by the Foundation from a submitter that may be protected from  disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA and Sec. 612.7(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person or entity from whom the Foundation  obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes  corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign  governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation of business information. A submitter of business  information must use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate  markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time  thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will  expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter  requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to submitters. The Foundation will provide a submitter  with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal  that seeks its business information wherever required under this  section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to  disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph  (f) of this section. The notice shall either describe the business  information requested or include copies of the requested records or  record portions containing the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where notice is required. Notice will be given to a submitter  wherever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information has been designated in good faith by the  submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under  Exemption 4; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Foundation has reason to believe that the information may be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. NSF will allow a submitter  a reasonable time, consistent with statutory requirements, to respond to  the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section. If a submitter  has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written  statement. The statement   must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information  under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, must  show why the information is a trade secret, or commercial or financial  information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a  submitter fails to respond within the time specified in the notice, the  submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the  information. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph  may itself be a record subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. The Foundation will consider a  submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in  deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever it decides  to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, the  Foundation will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reason(s) why the submitter's disclosure  objections were not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time  subsequent to the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of  paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Foundation determines that the information should not be  disclosed (the Foundation protects from disclosure to third parties  information about specific unfunded applications, including pending,  withdrawn, or declined proposals);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information lawfully has been published or has been  officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than  the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements  of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of  this section appears obviously frivolous, in which case the Foundation  will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date,  give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit  seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the Foundation  will promptly notify the submitter(s). Whenever a submitter files a  lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the  Foundation will notify the requester(s).</p>
