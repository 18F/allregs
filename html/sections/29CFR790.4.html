                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 4 of the Portal Act, quoted above, applies to situations  where an employee, on or after May 14, 1974, has engaged in activities  of the kind described in this section and has not been paid for or on  account of these activities in accordance with the statutory standards  established by the Fair Labor Standards Act. \16\ Where, in these  circumstances such activities are not compensable by contract, custom,  or practice as described in section 4, this section relieves the  employer from certain liabilities or punishments to which he might  otherwise be subject under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards  Act. \17\ The primary Congressional objectives in enacting section 4 of  the Portal Act, as disclosed by the statutory language and legislative  history were: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\16\ The Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, requires the payment  of the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime  compensation for all hours in excess of 40 in a workweek at a rate not  less than one and one-half times the employees regular rate of pay,  unless a specific exemption applies.</p><p class="depth0">\17\ The failure of an employer to compensate employees subject to  the Fair Labor Standards Act in accordance with its minimum wage and  overtime requirements makes him liable to them for the amount of their  unpaid minimum wages and unpaid overtime compensation together with an  additional equal amount (subject to section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal  Act, discussed below in Sec. 790.22) as liquidated damages (section  16(b) of the Act); and, if his Act or omission is willful, subjects him  to criminal penalties (section 16(a) of the Act). Civil actions for  injunction can be brought by the Administrator (sections 11(a) and 17 of  the Act). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To minimize uncertainty as to the liabilities of employers which  it was felt might arise in the future if the compensability under the  Fair Labor Standards Act of such preliminary or postliminary activities  should continue to be tested solely by existing criteria \18\ for  determining compensable   worktime, independently of contract, custom, or pratice; \19\ and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\18\ Employees subject to the minimum and overtime wage provisions  of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been held to be entitled to  compensation in accordance with the statutory standards, regardless of  contrary custom or contract, for all time spent during the workweek in  ``physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not), controlled or  required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the  benefit of the employer and his business'' (Tennessee Coal Iron & R.R.  Co. v. Muscoda Local, 321 U.S. 590, 598), as well as for all time spent  in active or inactive duties which such employees are engaged to perform  (Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126, 132-134; Skidmore v. Swift &  Co., 323, U.S. 134, 136-137).</p><p class="depth0">\19\ Portal Act, section 1: Senate Report, pp. 41, 42, 46-49;  Conference Report, pp. 12, 13; statements of Senator Wiley, 93 Cong.  Rec. 2084, 4269-4270; statements of Senator Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 2089,  2121, 2122, 2181, 2182, 2362, 2363; statements of Senator Cooper, 93  Cong.

Rec. 2181, 2182, 2362;  statements of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2294, 2296, 2297, 2299,  2300; statement of Representative Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 4388; statements  of Senator Wiley, 93 Cong. Rec. 2084, 4269-4270. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under section 4 of the Portal Act, an employer who fails to pay  an employee minimum wages or overtime compensation for or on account of  activities engaged in by such employee is relieved from liability or  punishment therefor if, and only if, such activities meet the following  three tests:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> They constitute ``walking, riding, or traveling'' of the kind  described in the statute, or other activities ``preliminary'' or  ``postliminary'' to the ``principal activity or activities'' which the  employee is employed to perform; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> They take place before or after the performance of all the  employee's ``principal activities'' in the workday; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> They are not compensable, during the portion of the day when  they are engaged in, by virtue of any contract, custom, or practice of  the kind described in the statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> It will be observed that section 4 of the Portal Act relieves an  employer of liability or punishment only with respect to activities of  the kind described, which have not been made compensable by a contract  or by a custom or practice (not inconsistent with a contract) at the  place of employment, in effect at the time the activities are performed.  The statute states that ``the employer shall not be so relieved'' if  such activities are so compensable; \21\ it does not matter in such a  situation that they are so-called ``portal-to-portal'' activities. \22\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\21\ Section 4(b) of the Act (quoted in Sec. 790.3).</p><p class="depth0">\22\ Conference Report, pp. 12, 13; colloquy between Senators  Donnell and Hakes, 93 Cong. Rec. 2181-2182; colloquy between Senators  Cooper and McGrath, 93 Cong. Rec. 2297-2298, cf. colloquy between  Senators Donnell and Hawkes, 93 Cong. Rec. 2179.   Accordingly, an employer who fails to take such activities into account  in paying compensation to an employee who is subject to the Fair Labor  Standards Act is not protected from liability or punishment in either of  the following situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where, at the time such activities are performed there is a  contract, whether written or not, in effect between the employer and the  employee (or the employee's agent or collective-bargaining  representative), and by an express provision of this contract the  activities are to be paid for; \23\ or ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\23\ Statements of Senator Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 2179, 2181, 2182;  statements of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2297, 2298, 2299. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where, at the time such activities are performed, there is in  effect at the place of employment a custom or practice to pay for such  activities, and this custom or practice is not inconsistent with any  applicable contract between such parties. \24\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\24\ Statements of Senator Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 2181, 2182.   In applying these principles, it should be kept in mind that under the  provisions of section 4(c) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, ``preliminary''  or ``postliminary'' activities which take place outside the workday  ``before the morning whistle'' or ``after the evening whistle'' are, for  purposes of the statute, not to be considered compensable by a contract,  custom or practice if such contract, custom or practice makes them  compensable only during some other portion of the day. \25\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\25\ Conference Report, pp. 12, 13.
