                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee who has received a gift that cannot be accepted  under this subpart shall, unless the gift is accepted by an agency  acting under specific statutory authority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return any tangible item to the donor or pay the donor its  market value. An employee who cannot ascertain the actual market value  of an item may estimate its market value by reference to the retail cost  of similar items of like quality. See Sec. 2635.203(c).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: To avoid public embarrassment to the seminar sponsor, an  employee of the National Park Service did not decline a barometer worth  $200 given at the conclusion of his speech on Federal lands policy. The  employee must either return the barometer or promptly reimburse the  sponsor $200.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When it is not practical to return a tangible item because it is  perishable, the item may, at the discretion of the employee's supervisor  or an agency ethics official, be given to an appropriate charity, shared  within the recipient's office, or destroyed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: With approval by the recipient's supervisor, a floral  arrangement sent by a disability claimant to a helpful employee of the  Social Security Administration may be placed in the office's reception  area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any entertainment, favor, service, benefit or other  intangible, reimburse the donor the market value. Subsequent  reciprocation by the employee does not constitute reimbursement.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: A Department of Defense employee wishes to attend a  charitable event to which he has been offered a $300 ticket by a  prohibited source. Although his attendance is not in the interest of the  agency under Sec. 2635.204(g), he may attend if he reimburses the donor  the $300 face value of the ticket.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dispose of gifts from foreign governments or international  organizations in accordance with 41 CFR part 101-49, and dispose of  materials received in conjunction with official travel in accordance  with 41 CFR 101-25.103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency may authorize disposition or return of gifts at  Government expense. Employees may use penalty mail to forward  reimbursements required or permitted by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee who, on his own initiative, promptly complies with  the requirements of this section will not be deemed to have improperly  accepted an unsolicited gift. An employee who promptly consults his  agency ethics official to determine whether acceptance of an unsolicited  gift is proper and who, upon the advice of the ethics official, returns  the gift or otherwise disposes of the gift in accordance with this  section, will be considered to have complied with the requirements of  this section on his own initiative.</p>
