                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A grantee proposing to acquire or undertake a major renovation of a facility must submit a detailed estimate of the costs of the proposed activity and compare the costs of the proposed activity as provided under paragraph (c) of this section and provide any additional information requested by the responsible HHS official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All costs of acquisition, renovation and ownership must be identified, including, but not limited to, professional fees, purchase of the facility to be renovated, renovation costs, moving expenses, additional transportation costs, maintenance, taxes, insurance, and easements, rights of way or land rentals. An independent appraisal of the current value of the facility proposed to be purchased, or which the grantee will continue to purchase with Head Start funds or to receive major renovation, made by a professional appraiser, must be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Grantees proposing to purchase a facility, without requesting funds for major renovations to the facility, must compare costs of the proposed facility to the cost of the facility currently used by the grantee, unless the grantee has no current facility, will lose the use of its current facility, intends to continue to use its current facility after it purchases the new facility, or has shown to the satisfaction of the responsible HHS official that its existing facility is inadequate. Where the grantee's current facility is not used as the alternate facility, the grantee must use for comparison a facility (or facilities) available for lease in the grantee's service area and suitable for use as a Head Start facility or which can be made suitable through incidental alteration or renovations, the cost of which shall be included in the cost comparison. In the case of an application for approval of the use of Head Start funds to continue purchase of a facility, the cost of the present facility must be compared to the cost of the facility used by the grantee before purchase of its current facility. If the facility used by the grantee before the purchase of its present facility was deemed inadequate by the responsible HHS official, or the grantee had no previous facility, the alternative facility shall be an available, appropriate facility (or facilities) of comparable size that was available for rent in the grantee's service are at the time of its purchase of the current facility. Grantees which have established under Sec. 1309.10(f) that there is a lack of alternative facilities that will prevent or would have prevented operation of the program are not required to provide a cost comparison under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grantees proposing to purchase a facility, without requesting funds for major renovations to the facility, must compare costs of the proposed facility to the cost of the facility currently used by the grantee, unless the grantee has no current facility, will lose the use of its current facility, intends to continue to use its current facility after it purchases the new facility, or has shown to the satisfaction of the responsible HHS official that its existing facility is inadequate.

The alternative facility is one now owned by the grantee or available for lease or purchase in the grantee's service area. If no such facility is available, this statement must explain how this fact was determined and the claim must be supported, whenever possible, by a written statement from a licensed real estate professional in the grantee's service area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A grantee proposing to undertake a major renovation of a facility must compare the cost of the proposed renovation (including the cost of purchasing the facility to be renovated, if the grantee is proposing to purchase the facility) to the costs of constructing a facility of comparable size. In place of the cost comparison required in the preceding sentence, a grantee proposing to make major renovations to a leased facility must show that the monthly or annual occupancy

costs for the term of the lease, including the cost of the major renovations, is less than, or comparable to, the costs of purchasing or leasing any other facility in the grantee's service area which can be made suitable through major renovations, if such a facility is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee must separately delineate the following expenses in the application:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One-time costs, including but not limited to, costs of purchasing the facility to be renovated, the down payment, professional fees, moving expenses, the cost of site preparation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ongoing costs, including, but not limited to, mortgage payments, insurance premiums, maintenance costs, and property taxes. If the grantee is exempt from the payment of property taxes, this fact must be stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The period of comparison for purchase, construction or major renovation of a facility is twenty years, except that for the purchase of a modular unit the period of comparison is ten years and the period of comparison for major renovation of a leased facility is the period of the lease remaining after the renovations are completed. For approvals of the use of Head Start funds to continue purchase of the facility the period of comparison begins on the date the purchase began.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the facility is to be used for other purposes in addition to the operation of the Head Start program, the cost of use of that part of the facility used for such other purposes must be allocated in accordance with applicable Office of Management and Budget cost principles.
