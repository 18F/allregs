                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition of underpayment. For the purposes of this section  underpayment means the difference between what a landholder owed for the  delivery of irrigation water under Federal reclamation law and what that  landholder paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collection of interest on underpayments. If a landholder has  incurred an underpayment, Reclamation will collect from the appropriate  district such underpayment with interest. Interest accrues from the  original payment due date until the district pays the amount due. The  original payment due date is the date the district should have paid the  United States for water delivered to the landholder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Underpayment interest rate. The Secretary of the Treasury  determines the interest rate charged the district based on the weighted  average yield of all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the  Department of the Treasury during the period of underpayment.</p>
