                            <p class="depth0">The Contracting Officer shall ensure that a COTR candidate is currently certified under HHS' FAC-COTR program before delegating authority to that individual to act as a COTR. Even if an individual is FAC-COTR-certified, a candidate becomes a COTR only when a Contracting Officer provides in writing the authorities the individual may exercise for a specified contract or order. Authority for such designations rests solely with the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall retain in the contract or order file the individual's active FAC-COTR certificate. In the event that the HCA has granted an exception--see 301.604-73, the Contracting Officer shall include the HCA's approval in the file.</p>
