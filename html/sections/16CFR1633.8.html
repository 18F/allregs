                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In order to issue a flammability standard under the  FFA, the FFA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to  include these in the regulation, 15 U.S.C. 1193(j)(2). These findings  are discussed in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary standards. No findings concerning compliance with and  adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary because no relevant  voluntary standard addressing the risk of injury that is addressed by  this regulation has been adopted and implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates the  potential total lifetime benefits of a mattress that complies with this  standard to range from $45 to $57 per mattress set (based on a 10 year  mattress life and a 3% discount rate). The Commission estimates total  resource costs of the standard to range from $8 to $22 per mattress.  This yields net benefits of $23 to $50 per mattress set. The Commission  estimates that aggregate lifetime benefits associated with all  mattresses produced the first year the standard becomes effective range  from $1,024 to $1,307 million, and that aggregate resource costs  associated with these mattresses range from $175 to $511 million,  yielding net benefits of about $514 to $1,132 million. Accordingly, the  Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable  relationship to its costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered the  following alternatives: alternative maximum peak heat release rate and  test duration, alternative total heat released in the first 10 minutes  of the test, mandatory production testing, a longer effective date,  taking no action, relying on a voluntary standard, and requiring  labeling alone (without any performance requirements). The alternatives  of taking no action, relying on a voluntary standard (if one existed),  and requiring labeling alone are unlikely to adequately reduce the risk.  Requiring a criterion of 25 MJ total heat release during the first 10  minutes of the test instead of 15 MJ would likely reduce the estimated  benefits (deaths and injuries reduced) without having much effect on  costs. Both options of increasing the duration of the test from 30  minutes to 60 minutes and decreasing the peak rate of heat release from  200 kW to 150 kW would likely increase costs significantly without  substantial increase in benefits. Requiring production testing would  also likely increase costs. Therefore, the Commission finds that an open  flame standard for mattresses with the testing requirements and criteria  that are specified in the Commission rule is the least burdensome  requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury  for which the regulation is being promulgated.</p>
