Within thirty days after service upon the applicant or registrant of a notice issued in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or registrant shall file a response with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy of the response on the Division of Enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the response, the applicant or registrant shall state whether he challenges the evidentiary basis of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice. The grounds for such a challenge shall include evidence as to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant's or registrant's identity,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The existence of a clerical error in any record documenting the statutory disqualification,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nature or date of the statutory disqualification,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The post-conviction modification of any record of conviction, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The favorable disposition of any appeal.

If the person is an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice. If the person is an associated person or an applicant for registration as an associated person and intends to make such a showing, he or she must also submit a letter signed by an officer or general partner authorized to bind the sponsor whereby the sponsor agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; if the person is a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in either capacity and intends to make such a showing, he or she must, in the case of a floor broker or applicant for registration as a floor broker, also submit a letter signed by his employer or if he or she has no employer by another floor broker or, in the case of a floor trader or applicant for registration as a floor trader, also submit a letter signed by an officer of the floor trader's clearing member, if such officer is a registrant or a principal of a registrant, or the chief operating officer of each contract market or swap execution facility that has granted trading privileges, whereby the employer or floor broker, appropriate registrant, principal or chief operating officer (on behalf of the contract market or swap execution facility) agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; provided, that, with respect to such sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, supervising registrant or principal:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the response, if the person is not an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice.

The factors forming the basis for a disqualified applicant's or registrant's showing referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Evidence mitigating the seriousness of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Evidence that the applicant or registrant has undergone rehabilitation since the time of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the person is an associated person, floor broker or floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, evidence that the applicant's or registrant's registration on a conditioned or restricted basis would be subject to supervisory controls likely both to detect future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant and protect the public from any harm arising from the applicant's or registrant's future wrongdoing, including proposed conditions or restrictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reply. Within thirty days after the latter of the date the applicant or registrant serves a copy of the response on the Division of Enforcement (if no further submission is to be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or the date the applicant or registrant serves a copy of the further submission made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on the Division of Enforcement, the Division of Enforcement shall file a reply thereto with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy of the reply on the applicant or registrant. The Division of Enforcement's reply shall include either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A motion for summary disposition stating that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be determined and that registration should be denied or revoked, based upon the applicant's or registrant's response and further submission, if any, and any other materials which are attached to the reply and would be admissible under Sec. 10.91 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of factual issues raised in the applicant's or registrant's response and further submission, if any, that the Division of Enforcement regards as material and disputed. Such a reply shall also include the identity and a summary of the expected testimony of each witness whom the Division intends to have testify, and copies of all documents which the Division intends to introduce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Oral Presentation. Within thirty days of the date the Division of Enforcement files its reply in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section to the applicant's or registrant's response and further submission, if any, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Administrative Law Judge finds, based on the motion for summary disposition, that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, granting, denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of an applicant or registrant, or dismissing the notice issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and such order shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notifying the parties of a time and place of hearing. At such hearing, the parties shall be limited to presentation of witnesses and documents listed in previous filings except, for good cause shown, the parties may request that the witness and document lists be supplemented for purposes of rebuttal.

To effect such an election, the party shall file a notice with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy on all opposing parties within fifteen days of the date the Administrative Law Judge's notice is served. The filing of an election to participate by telephone will be deemed a waiver of the party's right to a full oral hearing on the parties' material disputes of fact. The Administrative Law Judge shall schedule a telephonic hearing only if all parties to the proceeding elect such a procedure. The Administrative Law Judge shall conduct such a hearing in accordance with Sec. 12.209(b) of this chapter. Following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge

shall issue a written decision in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination by Administrative Law Judge--Standards of Proof. The Administrative Law Judge's written determination shall specifically consider whether the Division of Enforcement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant or registrant is subject to the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice issued by the Commission and, where appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In actions involving statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2) of the Act, whether the applicant or registrant has made a clear and convincing showing that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the statutory disqualification; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In actions involving statutory disqualifications set forth in sections 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act, whether the applicant or registrant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the statutory disqualification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of Administrative Law Judge--Findings. In making his written determination, the Administrative Law Judge shall set forth the facts material to his conclusion and provide an explanation of his decision in light of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice and, where appropriate, his findings regarding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence mitigating the seriousness of the wrongdoing underlying the applicant's or registrant's statutory disqualification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that the applicant or registrant has undergone rehabilitation since the time of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the person is an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, evidence that the applicant's or registrant's registration on a conditioned or restricted basis would be subject to supervisory controls likely both to detect future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant and protect the public from any harm arising from future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant. Any decision providing for a conditioned or restricted registration shall take into consideration the applicant's or registrant's statutory disqualification and the time period remaining on such statutory disqualification, and shall fix a time period after which the registrant and his or her sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal, contract market, or swap execution facility may petition to lift or modify the conditions or restrictions in accordance with Sec. 3.64.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Default.

Offers of settlement made by a respondent shall be

submitted in writing to the Division of Enforcement, which shall present them to the Commission with the Division's recommendation.

Any offer of settlement not presented to the Commission shall be null and void with respect to any acknowledgment, admission, waiver, stipulation or consent contained in the offer and shall not be used in any manner in the proceeding by any party thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acceptance of offer.

When an offer of settlement is rejected, the party making the offer shall be notified by the Division of Enforcement and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. A rejected offer of settlement and any documents relating thereto shall not constitute a part of the record in the proceeding; and the offer will be null and void with respect to any acknowledgment, admission, waiver, stipulation or consent contained in the offer and shall not be used in any manner in the proceeding by any party thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Effect of the Administrative Law Judge's Determination. The Administrative Law Judge's written determination shall become the final decision of the Commission thirty days following the date the Proceedings Clerk serves the determination on the parties unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One or more of the parties files and serves a timely notice of appeal in accordance with Sec. 10.102 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission issues an order staying the effective date of the determination and notifying the parties of its intention to undertake sua sponte review in accordance with Sec. 10.105 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Appeal. Following the filing of a notice of appeal, the rules of appellate procedure set forth in Sec.
