                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part, we define these terms:</p><p class="depth0">BIG-funded facility means only the part of a facility that we fund through a BIG grant.</p><p class="depth0">Boating infrastructure means all of the structures, equipment, accessories, and services that are necessary or desirable for a facility to accommodate eligible vessels. See Sec.  86.12 for examples of boating infrastructure.</p><p class="depth0">Capital improvement means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A new structure that costs at least $25,000 to build; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Altering, renovating, or repairing an existing structure if it increases the structure's useful life by 10 years or if it costs at least $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">Concessioner means an entity with which a State has a written agreement to operate or manage a BIG-funded facility. The agreement with a concessioner may or may not involve a financial exchange. A concessioner is not a contractor or vendor. You pay a contractor or vendor to perform specific duties or supply specific materials according to a written contract. Concessioners, vendors, and contractors are not grant recipients.</p><p class="depth0">Construction means the act of building or significantly altering, renovating, or repairing a structure. Clearing and reshaping land and demolishing structures are types or phases of construction. Examples of structures

are buildings, docks, piers, breakwaters, and slips.</p><p class="depth0">Director means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service whom the Secretary of the Interior has delegated authority to administer BIG nationally; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A deputy or another person whom the Director has delegated authority over BIG.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible user means an operator or passenger of an eligible vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible vessel means a transient recreational vessel at least 26 feet long.

The legal instrument used is a grant agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Grants.gov is a centralized location for States and other entities to find and apply for Federal funding. It is located at http://www.grants.gov. We require States to use grants.gov, or any system that replaces it, to apply for BIG grants.</p><p class="depth0">Maintenance means keeping structures or equipment in a condition to serve the intended purpose. It includes cyclical or occasional actions to keep facilities fully functional. It does not include operational actions such as janitorial work.

Examples of operation are janitorial work, service workers, facility administration, utilities, rent, taxes, and insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Operator means an individual or entity that is responsible for operating a BIG-funded facility. An operator may be a grantee, a subgrantee, a concessioner, or another individual or entity that the grantee has an arrangement with to operate the BIG-funded facility.</p><p class="depth0">Personal property means anything tangible or intangible that is not real property.</p><p class="depth0">Program income means gross income earned by the grantee or subgrantee that is directly generated by a grant-supported activity, or earned as a result of the grant, during the period of performance.</p><p class="depth0">Project means one or more related actions that are eligible for BIG funding, achieve specific goals and objectives of BIG, and in the case of construction, occur at only one facility.</p><p class="depth0">Project cost means total allowable costs incurred under BIG and includes Federal funds awarded through the BIG
