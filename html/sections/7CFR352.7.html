                            <p class="depth0">Immediately upon arrival of any shipment of plants or plant products (including noxious weeds) subject to this part and covered by a specific permit, the importer shall submit in duplicate through the U.S. Collector of Customs for the U.S. Department of Agriculture a notice of such arrival on a form provided for that purpose (PQ-368) and shall give such information as is called for by that form and, in addition, where relevant, the proposed routing to the proposed U.S. port of exit. Notice of arrival shall not be required for other products or articles subject to this part since other available documentation meets the requirement for this notice.
