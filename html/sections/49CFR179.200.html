The permanent attachment of supplementary exterior fittings shall be approved by the AAR Committee on Tank Cars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bottom outlet must be of approved construction, and be provided with a liquid-tight closure at its lower end.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On cars with center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted on a pad or nozzle with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment. In no case shall the breakage groove or equivalent extend below the bottom flange of the center sill. On cars without continuous center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment on a pad attached to the outside bottom of the tank. The mounting pad must have a maximum thickness of 2\1/2\ inches measured on the longitudinal centerline of the tank.

In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the ``V'' be more than \1/4\ inch. The outlet nozzle on interior valves or the valve

body on exterior valves may be steam jacketed, in which case the breakage groove or its equivalent must be below the steam chamber but above the bottom of center sill construction. If the outlet nozzle is not a single piece, or if exterior valves are applied, provisions shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove.

On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The flange on the outlet nozzle or the valve body of exterior valves must be of a thickness which will prevent distortion of the valve seat or valve by any change in contour of the shell resulting from expansion of lading, or other causes, and which will insure that accidental breakage of the outlet nozzle will occur at or below the ``V'' groove, or its equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The valve must have no wings or stem projecting below the ``V'' groove or its equivalent. The valve and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs, including grinding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The valve operating mechanism on interior valves must have means for compensating for variation in the vertical diameter of the tank produced by expansion, weight of the liquid contents, or other causes, and may operate from the interior of the tank, but in the event the rod is carried through the dome, or tank shell, leakage must be prevented by packing in stuffing box or other suitable seals and a cap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If indicated in Sec. 179.201-1, tank may be equipped with bottom washout of approved construction. If applied, bottom washout shall be in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The extreme projection of the bottom washout equipment may not be more than that allowed by appendix E of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bottom washout shall be of cast, forged or fabricated metal. If welded to tank, they shall be of good weldable quality in conjunction with metal of tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the washout nozzle extends 6 inches or more from the shell of the tank, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part of the nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of the inside closure seat or plug. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the ``V'' be more than \1/4\ inch. Where the nozzle is not a single piece, provisions shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove. The nozzle must be of a thickness to insure that accidental breakage will occur at or below the ``V'' groove or its equivalent. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the outer shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The closure plug and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs, including grinding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The closure of the washout nozzle must be equipped with a \3/4\-inch solid screw plug.
