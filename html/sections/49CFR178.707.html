                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> to indicate the material used for the  outer packaging. Composite IBC types are designated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 11HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for  solids loaded or discharged by gravity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 11HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle  for solids loaded or discharged by gravity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 21HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for  solids loaded or discharged under pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 21HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle  for solids loaded or discharged under pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 31HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for  liquids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 31HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle  for liquids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions for composite IBC types:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A composite IBC is an IBC which consists of a rigid outer  packaging enclosing a plastic inner receptacle together with any service  or other structural equipment. The outer packaging of a composite IBC is  designed to bear the entire stacking load. The inner receptacle and  outer packaging form an integral packaging and are filled, stored,  transported, and emptied as a unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term plastic means polymeric materials (i.e., plastic or  rubber).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A ``rigid'' inner receptacle is an inner receptacle which  retains its general shape when empty without closures in place and  without benefit of the outer casing. Any inner receptacle that is not  ``rigid'' is considered to be ``flexible.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction requirements for composite IBCs with plastic inner  receptacles are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The outer packaging must consist of rigid material formed so as  to protect the inner receptacle from physical damage during handling and  transportation, but is not required to perform the secondary containment  function. It includes the base pallet where appropriate. The inner  receptacle is not intended to perform a containment function without the  outer packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A composite IBC with a fully enclosing outer packaging must be  designed to permit assessment of the integrity of the inner container  following the leakproofness and hydraulic tests. The outer packaging of  31HZ2 composite IBCs must enclose the inner receptacles on all sides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The inner receptacle must be manufactured from plastic material  of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity  and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance  with the requirements of Sec. 173.24 of this subchapter, the material  must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet  radiation. The inner receptacle of 31HZ2 composite IBCs must consist of  at least three plies of film.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If necessary, protection against ultraviolet radiation must be  provided by the addition of pigments or inhibitors such as carbon black.  These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain  effective throughout the life of the inner receptacle. Where use is made  of carbon black, pigments, or inhibitors, other than those used in the  manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if the  carbon black content, the pigment content, or the inhibitor content do  not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of  construction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic  material of the inner receptacle to improve resistance to aging,  provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical  properties of the material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No used material other than production residues or regrind  from the same manufacturing process may be used in the manufacture of  inner receptacles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Composite IBCs intended for the transportation of liquids must  be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor to prevent the body  of the IBC from rupturing if it is subjected to an internal pressure in  excess of that for which it was hydraulically tested. This may be  achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by  other means of construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The strength of the construction material comprising the outer  packaging and the manner of construction must be appropriate to the  capacity of the composite IBC and its intended use. The outer packaging  must be free of any projection that might damage the inner receptacle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outer packagings of natural wood must be constructed of well  seasoned wood that is commercially dry and free from defects that would  materially lessen the strength of any part of the outer packaging. The  tops and bottoms may be made of water-resistant reconstituted wood such  as hardboard or particle board. Materials other than natural wood may be  used for construction of structural equipment of the outer packaging.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outer packagings of plywood must be made of well-seasoned,  rotary cut, sliced, or sawn veneer, commercially dry and free from  defects that would materially lessen the strength of the casing. All  adjacent plies must be glued with water-resistant adhesive. Materials  other than plywood may be used for construction of structural equipment  of the outer packaging. Outer packagings must be firmly nailed or  secured to corner posts or ends or be assembled by equally suitable  devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Outer packagings of reconstituted wood must be constructed of  water-resistant reconstituted wood such as hardboard or particle board.  Materials other than reconstituted wood may be used for the construction  of structural equipment of reconstituted wood outer packaging.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fiberboard outer packagings must be constructed of strong,  solid, or double-faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Water resistance of the outer surface must be such that the  increase in mass, as determined in a test carried out over a period of  30 minutes by the Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not  greater than 155 grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square  foot)--see ISO 535 (E) (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).  Fiberboard must have proper bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut,  creased without cutting through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted  so as to permit assembly without cracking, surface breaks, or undue  bending. The fluting   of corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to the facings.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ends of fiberboard outer packagings may have a wooden frame  or be constructed entirely of wood. Wooden battens may be used for  reinforcements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Manufacturers' joints in the bodies of outer packagings must be  taped, lapped and glued, or lapped and stitched with metal staples.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Lapped joints must have an appropriate overlap.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Where closing is effected by gluing or taping, a water-resistant  adhesive must be used.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> All closures must be sift-proof.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Outer packagings of plastic materials must be constructed in  accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any integral pallet base forming part of an IBC, or any  detachable pallet, must be suitable for the mechanical handling of an  IBC filled to its maximum permissible gross mass.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pallet or integral base must be designed to avoid  protrusions that may cause damage to the IBC in handling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The outer packaging must be secured to any detachable pallet to  ensure stability in handling and transportation. Where a detachable  pallet is used, its top surface must be free from sharp protrusions that  might damage the IBC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Strengthening devices, such as timber supports to increase  stacking performance, may be used but must be external to the inner  receptacle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The load-bearing surfaces of IBCs intended for stacking must be  designed to distribute loads in a stable manner. An IBC intended for  stacking must be designed so that loads are not supported by the inner  receptacle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Intermediate IBCs of type 31HZ2 must be limited to a capacity of  not more than 1,250 L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Composite IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than  3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).
