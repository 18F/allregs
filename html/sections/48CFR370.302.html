Once the institution ``submits'' an  electronic file to OHRP, the institution must fax or mail (but not both)  a copy of the signature page to initiate the review process. The  institution shall mail the FWA to the OHRP, U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services, 1101 Wootton Parkway, Suite 200, Rockville, Maryland  20852, or fax it to OHRP at 240-453-8202 (but not both).</p>
