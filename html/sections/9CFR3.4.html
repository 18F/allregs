                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Restrictions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following categories of dogs or cats must  not be kept in outdoor facilities, unless that practice is specifically  approved by the attending veterinarian:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dogs or cats that are not acclimated to the temperatures  prevalent in the area or region where they are maintained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Breeds of dogs or cats that cannot tolerate the prevalent  temperatures of the area without stress or discomfort (such as short- haired breeds in cold climates); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sick, infirm, aged or young dogs or cats.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When their acclimation status is unknown, dogs and cats must not  be kept in outdoor facilities when the ambient temperature is less than  50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shelter from the elements. Outdoor facilities for dogs or cats  must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each  animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each  animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal  manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the shelter structures,  one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large  enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the  direct rays of the sun. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or cats  must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor, and must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the dogs and cats with adequate protection and shelter  from the cold and heat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide the dogs and cats with protection from the direct rays  of the sun and the direct effect of wind, rain, or snow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be provided with a wind break and rain break at the entrance;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature  is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is  required when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction. Building surfaces in contact with animals in  outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture. Metal  barrels, cars, refrigerators or freezers, and the like must not be used  as shelter structures. The floors of outdoor housing facilities may be  of compacted earth, absorbent bedding, sand, gravel, or grass, and must  be replaced if there are any prevalent odors, diseases, insects, pests,  or vermin. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces  of outdoor housing facilities--including houses, dens, etc.--that cannot  be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.</p>
