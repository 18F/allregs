(3) of this section for each fiber spinning line that uses a spin dope produced from either a suspension polymerization process or solution polymerization process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must reduce the AN concentration of the spin dope to less than 100 ppmw; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must design and operate a fiber spinning line enclosure according to the requirements in Sec. 63.1103(b)(4) of subpart YY and reduce AN emissions by 85 weight-percent or more by venting emissions from the enclosure through a closed vent system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements in Sec. 63.982(a)(2) of subpart SS; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must reduce AN emissions from the spinning line to less than or equal to 0.5 pounds of AN per ton (lb/ton) of acrylic and modacrylic fiber produced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must comply with the requirements for storage vessels holding acrylonitrile as shown in Table 2 to Sec. 63.1103(b)(3)(i) of subpart YY.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must comply with the requirements for equipment that contains or contacts 10 percent by weight or more of AN and operates 300 hours per year as shown in Table 2 to Sec. 63.1103(b)(3)(i) of subpart YY.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must comply with the requirements for process wastewater and maintenance wastewater from an acrylic and modacrylic fibers production process as shown in Table 2 to Sec. 63.1103(b)(3)(i) of subpart YY.
