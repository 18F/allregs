                                Sec. 780.511  Meaning of ``agricultural employee.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An ``agricultural employee,'' for purposes of section 13(a)(14), may  be defined as an employee employed in activities which are included in  the definition of ``agriculture'' in section 3(f) of the Act (see Sec.  780.103), and who is employed in these activities with sufficient  regularity or continuity to characterize him as a person who engages in  them as an occupation. Isolated or sporadic instances of engagement by  an employee in activities defined as ``agriculture'' would not  ordinarily establish that he is an ``agricultural employee.'' His  engagement in agriculture should be sufficiently substantial to  demonstrate some dedication to agricultural work as a means of  livelihood.    Sec. 780.512  ``Employed in the growing and harvesting.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 13(a)(14) exempts processing operations on shade-grown  tobacco only when performed by agricultural employees ``employed in the  growing and harvesting'' of such tobacco. The use of the term ``and'' in  the phrase ``growing and harvesting'' may be in recognition of the fact  that in the raising of shade-grown tobacco the two operations are  typically intermingled; however, it is not considered that the word  ``and'' would preclude a determination on the particular facts that an  employee is qualified for the exemption if he is employed only in  ``growing'' or only in ``harvesting.'' Employment in work other than  growing and harvesting of shade-grown tobacco will not satisfy the  requirement that the employee be employed in growing and   harvesting, even if such work is on shade-grown tobacco and constitutes  ``agriculture'' as defined in section 3(f) of the Act. For example,  delivery of the tobacco by an employee of the farmer to the receiving  platform of the bulking plant would be a ``delivery to market'' included  in ``agriculture'' when performed by the farmer as an incident to or in  conjunction with his farming operations (Mitchell v. Budd, 350 U.S.  473), but it would not be part of ``growing and harvesting.''</p>
