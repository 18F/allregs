                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Shortly after the Board's decision and order is issued the  Director of the   Regional Office in which the charge was filed communicates with the  respondent for the purpose of obtaining compliance. Conferences may be  held to arrange the details necessary for compliance with the terms of  the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the respondent effects full compliance with the terms of the  order, the Regional Director submits a report to that effect to  Washington, DC, after which the case may be closed. Despite compliance,  however, the Board's order is a continuing one; therefore, the closing  of a case on compliance is necessarily conditioned upon the continued  observance of that order; and in some cases it is deemed desirable,  notwithstanding compliance, to implement the order with an enforcing  court judgment. Subsequent violations of the order may become the basis  of further proceedings.</p>
