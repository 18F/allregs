                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. If, however, the  requirements necessitating the filing of the declaration are first met,  in the case of an individual on the calendar year basis, after April  1st, but before June 2d of the calendar year, the declaration must be  filed on or before June 15th; if such requirements are first met after  June 1st and before September 2d, the declaration must be filed on or  before September 15th; and if such requirements are first met after  September 1st, the declaration must be filed on or before January 15th  of the succeeding calendar year. In the case of an individual on the  fiscal year basis, see Sec. 1.6073-2. A special rule applies to  nonresident aliens who do not have wages subject to withholding under  Chapter 24 of the code and are not treated as residents under section  6013 (g) or (h) of the code. For taxable years beginning after December  31, 1976, these aliens are not required to file a declaration of  estimated tax before June 15th.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Farmers or fishermen--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of an  individual on a calendar year basis:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If at least two-thirds of the individual's total estimated gross  income from all sources for the calendar year is from farming or fishing  (including oyster farming), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If at least two-thirds of the individual's total gross income  from all sources shown on the return for the preceding taxable year was  from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) (with respect to  declarations of estimated tax for taxable years beginning after November  10, 1978),   He may file a declaration of estimated tax on or before the 15th day of  January of the succeeding calendar year in lieu of the time prescribed  in paragraph (a) of this section. For the filing of a return in lieu of  a declaration, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.6015-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Farmers. The estimated gross income from farming is the  estimated income resulting from oyster farming, the cultivation of the  soil, the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural  commodities, and the raising of livestock, bees, or poultry. In other  words, the requisite gross income must be derived from the operations of  a stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, or truck farm, or plantation, ranch,  nursery, range, orchard, or oyster bed. If an individual receives for  the use of his land income in the form of a share of the crops produced  thereon such income is from farming. As to determination of income of  farmers, see sections 61 and 162 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fishermen. The estimated gross income from fishing is the  estimated income resulting from the catching, taking, harvesting,  cultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish (for example,  clams and mussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs, and  shrimps), sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and  vegetable life. The estimated gross income from fishing includes the  income expected to be received by an officer or member of the crew of a  vessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity, whether or not  the officer or member of the crew is himself so engaged, and, in the  case of an individual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ  of any person, the income expected to be received by such individual  from such employment. In addition, income expected to be received for  services performed as an ordinary incident to any such activity is  estimated gross income from fishing. Similarly, for example, the  estimated gross income from fishing includes income expected to be  received from the shore services of an officer or member of the crew of  a vessel engaged in any such activity, if such services are an ordinary  incident to any such activity. Services performed as an ordinary  incident to such activities include, for example, services performed   in such cleaning, icing, and packing of fish as are necessary for the  immediate preservation of the catch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>  (relating to returns of nonresident aliens whose wages are not subject  to withholding) whose estimated gross income for the calendar year meets  the requirements of section 6015(a), a declaration of estimated tax for  the calendar year need not be made before June 15th of such calendar  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Place for filing declaration. Except as provided in paragraph  (b) of Sec. 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), the  declaration of estimated tax shall be filed at the place prescribed by  the instructions applicable to such declaration. For example, if the  instructions applicable to a declaration provide that the declaration of  a taxpayer located in North Carolina be filed with the Director,  Internal Revenue Service Center, Chamblee, Ga., such declaration shall  be filed with the service center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment of declaration. An amended declaration of estimated  tax may be filed during any interval between installment dates  prescribed for the taxable year. However, no amended declaration may be  filed until after the installment date on or before which the original  declaration was filed and only one amended declaration may be filed  during each interval between installment dates. Except as provided in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents),  an amended declaration shall be filed with the internal revenue officer  with whom the original declaration was filed.
