                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Technology-based treatment requirements under section  301(b) of the Act represent the minimum level of control that must be  imposed in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act. (See Sec. Sec.  122.41, 122.42 and 122.44 for a discussion of additional or more  stringent effluent limitations and conditions.) Permits shall contain  the following technology-based treatment requirements in accordance with  the following statutory deadlines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For POTW's, effluent limitations based upon:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Secondary treatment--from date of permit issuance;

Technology-based treatment requirements may be imposed through  one of the following three methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application of EPA-promulgated effluent limitations developed  under section 304 of the Act to dischargers by category or subcategory.  These effluent limitations are not applicable to the extent that they  have been remanded or withdrawn. However, in the case of a court remand,  determinations underlying effluent limitations shall be binding in  permit issuance proceedings where those determinations are not required  to be reexamined by a court remanding the regulations. In addition,  dischargers may seek fundamentally different factors variances from  these effluent limitations under Sec. 122.21 and subpart D of this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the Act, to  the extent that EPA-promulgated effluent limitations are inapplicable.  The permit writer shall apply the appropriate factors listed in Sec.  125.3(d) and shall consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The appropriate technology for the category or class of point  sources of which the applicant is a member,   based upon all available information; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any unique factors relating to the applicant.  [Comment: These factors must be considered in all cases, regardless of  whether the permit is being issued by EPA or an approved State.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Through a combination of the methods in paragraphs (d) (1) and  (2) of this section. Where promulgated effluent limitations guidelines  only apply to certain aspects of the discharger's operation, or to  certain pollutants, other aspects or activities are subject to  regulation on a case-by-case basis in order to carry out the provisions  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations developed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section may  be expressed, where appropriate, in terms of toxicity (e.g., ``the  LC50 for fat head minnow of the effluent from outfall 001  shall be greater than 25%''). Provided, That is shown that the limits  reflect the appropriate requirements (for example, technology-based or  water-quality-based standards) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In setting case-by-case limitations pursuant to Sec. 125.3(c),  the permit writer must consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For BPT requirements: (i) The total cost of application of  technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved  from such application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The age of equipment and facilities involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The process employed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The engineering aspects of the application of various types of  control techniques;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Process changes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy  requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For BCT requirements: (i) The reasonableness of the relationship  between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluent and the effluent  reduction benefits derived;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The comparison of the cost and level of reduction of such  pollutants from the discharge from publicly owned treatment works to the  cost and level of reduction of such pollutants from a class or category  of industrial sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The age of equipment and facilities involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The process employed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The engineering aspects of the application of various types of  control techniques;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Process changes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy  requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For BAT requirements: (i) The age of equipment and facilities  involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The process employed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The engineering aspects of the application of various types of  control techniques;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Process changes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The cost of achieving such effluent reduction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy  requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Technology-based treatment requirements are applied prior to or  at the point of discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Technology-based treatment requirements cannot be satisfied  through the use of ``non-treatment'' techniques such as flow  augmentation and in-stream mechanical aerators. However, these  techniques may be considered as a method of achieving water quality  standards on a case-by-case basis when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The technology-based treatment requirements applicable to the  discharge are not sufficient to achieve the standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The discharger agrees to waive any opportunity to request a  variance under section 301 (c), (g) or (h) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The discharger demonstrates that such a technique is the  preferred environmental and economic method to achieve the standards  after consideration of alternatives such as advanced waste treatment,  recycle and reuse, land disposal, changes in operating methods, and  other available methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Technology-based effluent limitations shall be established under  this subpart for solids, sludges, filter backwash, and other pollutants  removed in the course of treatment or control of wastewaters in the same  manner as for other pollutants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Director may set a permit limit for a conventional  pollutant at a   level more stringent than the best conventional pollution control  technology (BCT), or a limit for a nonconventional pollutant which shall  not be subject to modification under section 301 (c) or (g) of the Act  where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effluent limitations guidelines specify the pollutant as an  indicator for a toxic pollutant, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The limitation reflects BAT-level control of discharges of  one or more toxic pollutants which are present in the waste stream, and  a specific BAT limitation upon the toxic pollutant(s) is not feasible  for economic or technical reasons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The permit identifies which toxic pollutants are intended to be  controlled by use of the limitation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The fact sheet required by Sec. 124.56 sets forth the basis for  the limitation, including a finding that compliance with the limitation  will result in BAT-level control of the toxic pollutant discharges  identified in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, and a finding  that it would be economically or technically infeasible to directly  limit the toxic pollutant(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director may set a permit limit for a conventional pollutant  at a level more stringent than BCT when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effluent limitations guidelines specify the pollutant as an  indicator for a hazardous substance, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The limitation reflects BAT-level control of discharges (or  an appropriate level determined under section 301(c) or (g) of the Act)  of one or more hazardous substance(s) which are present in the waste  stream, and a specific BAT (or other appropriate) limitation upon the  hazardous substance(s) is not feasible for economic or technical  reasons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The permit identifies which hazardous substances are intended to  be controlled by use of the limitation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The fact sheet required by Sec. 124.56 sets forth the basis for  the limitation, including a finding that compliance with the limitations  will result in BAT-level (or other appropriate level) control of the  hazardous substances discharges identified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of  this section, and a finding that it would be economically or technically  infeasible to directly limit the hazardous substance(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hazardous substances which are also toxic pollutants are  subject to paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Director may not set a more stringent limit under the  preceding paragraphs if the method of treatment required to comply with  the limit differs from that which would be required if the toxic  pollutant(s) or hazardous substance(s) controlled by the limit were  limited directly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Toxic pollutants identified under paragraph (h)(1) of this  section remain subject to the requirements of Sec. 122.42(a)(1)  (notification of increased discharges of toxic pollutants above levels  reported in the application form).
