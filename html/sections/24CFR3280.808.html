                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as specifically permitted by this part, the wiring methods and materials specified in the National Electrical Code, NFPA No. 70-2005, must be used in manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonmetallic outlet boxes shall be acceptable only with nonmetallic cable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonmetallic cable located 15 inches or less above the floor, if exposed, shall be protected from physical damage by covering boards, guard strips, or conduit. Cable likely to be damaged by stowage shall be so protected in all cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nonmetallic sheathed cable shall be secured by staples, straps, or similar fittings so designed and installed as not to injure any cable. Cable shall be secured in place at intervals not exceeding 4\1/2\ feet and within 12 inches from every cabinet, box or fitting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Metal-clad and nonmetallic cables shall be permitted to pass through the centers of the wide side of 2-inch by 4-inch studs. However, they shall be protected where they pass through 2-inch by 2-inch studs or at other studs or frames where the cable or armor would be less than 1\1/2\ inches from the inside or outside surface of the studs when the wall covering materials are in contact with the studs. Steel plates on each side of the cable, or a tube, with not less than No. 16 MSG wall thickness shall be required to protect the cable. These plates or tubes shall be securely held in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where metal faceplates are used, they must be effectively grounded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the range, clothes dryer, or similar appliance is connected by metalclad cable or flexible conduit, a length of not less than three feet of free cable or conduit shall be provided to permit moving the appliance. Type NM or Type SE cable shall not be used to connect a range or a dryer. This shall not prohibit the use of Type NM or Type SE cable between the branch circuit overcurrent protective device and a junction box or range or dryer receptacle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where rigid metal conduit or intermediate metal conduit is terminated at an enclosure with a locknut and bushing connection, two locknuts must be provided, one inside and one outside of the enclosure. Rigid nonmetallic conduit or electrical nonmetallic tubing is permitted. All cut ends of conduit and tubing must be reamed or otherwise finished to remove rough edges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Switches must be rated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For lighting circuits, switches must be rated not less than 10 amperes, 120 to 125 volts, and in no case less than the connected load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For motors or other loads, switches shall have ampere or horsepower ratings, or both, adequate for loads controlled. (An ``AC general-use'' snap switch shall be permitted to control a motor 2 horsepower or less with full-load current not over 80 percent of the switch ampere rating).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> At least 4 inches of free conductor shall be left at each outlet box except where conductors are intended to loop without joints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> When outdoor or under-chassis line-voltage (120 volts, nominal or higher) wiring is exposed to moisture or physical damage, it must be protected by rigid metal conduit or intermediate metal conduit. The conductors must be suitable for wet locations. Electrical metallic tubing or rigid nonmetallic conduit is permitted to be used when closely routed against frames and equipment enclosures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Outlet boxes of dimensions less than those required in Table 314.16(A) of the National Electrical Code, NFPA No. 70-2005, are permitted provided the box has been tested and approved for that purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Boxes, fittings, and cabinets shall be securely fastened in place, and shall be supported from a structural member of the home, either directly or by using a substantial brace. Snap-in type boxes provided with special wall or ceiling brackets that securely fasten boxes in walls or ceilings shall be permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Outlet boxes must fit closely to openings in combustible walls and ceilings and must be flush with the finish surface or project therefrom. In walls and ceilings of noncombustible material, outlet boxes and fittings must be installed so that the front edge of the box or fitting will not be set back from the finished surface more than \1/4\ inch.

Plaster, drywall, or plasterboard surfaces that are broken or incomplete must be repaired so that there will be no gaps or open spaces greater than \1/8\ inch at the edge of the box or fitting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Appliances having branch-circuit terminal connections which operate at temperatures higher than 60 [deg]C (140 [deg]F) shall have circuit conductors as described in paragraphs (p) (1) and (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Branch-circuit conductors having an insulation suitable for the temperature encountered shall be permitted to run directly to the appliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conductors having an insulation suitable for the temperature encountered may be run from the appliance terminal connections to a readily accessible outlet box placed at least one foot from the appliance. If provided, these conductors must be in a suitable raceway or Type AC or MC cable, of at least 18 inches but not more than 6 feet in length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> A substantial brace for securing a box, fitting, or cabinet must be as described in the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70-2005, Article 314.23(B), or the brace, including the fastening mechanism to attach the brace to the home structure, must withstand a force of 50 lbs. applied to the brace at the intended point(s) of attachment for the box in a direction perpendicular to the surface on which the box is installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Where the sheathing of NM cable has been cut or damaged and visual inspection reveals that the conductor and its insulation has not been damaged, it shall be permitted to repair the cable sheath with electrical tape which provides equivalent protection to the sheath.
