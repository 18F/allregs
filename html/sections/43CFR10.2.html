                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the term Act, which means the Native American Graves  Protection and Repatriation Act as described above, definitions used in  these regulations are grouped in seven classes: Parties required to  comply with these regulations; Parties with standing to make claims  under these regulations; Parties responsible for implementing these  regulations; Objects covered by these regulations; Cultural affiliation;  Types of land covered by these regulations; and Procedures required by  these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who must comply with these regulations? (1) Federal agency means  any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States. Such  term does not include the Smithsonian Institution as specified in  section 2 (4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal agency official means any individual authorized by  delegation of authority within a Federal agency to perform the duties  relating to these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Museum means any institution or State or local government agency  (including any institution of higher learning) that has possession of,  or control over, human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or  objects of cultural patrimony and receives Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``possession'' means having physical custody of human  remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural  patrimony with a sufficient legal interest to lawfully treat the objects  as part of its collection for purposes of these regulations. Generally,  a museum or Federal agency would not be considered to have possession of  human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural  patrimony on loan from another individual, museum, or Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``control'' means having a legal interest in human  remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural  patrimony sufficient to lawfully permit the museum or Federal agency to  treat the objects as part of its collection for purposes of these  regulations whether or not the human remains, funerary objects, sacred  objects or objects of cultural patrimony are in the physical custody of  the museum or Federal agency. Generally, a museum or Federal agency that  has loaned human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects  of cultural patrimony to another individual, museum, or Federal agency  is considered to retain control of those human remains, funerary  objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony for purposes  of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The phrase ``receives Federal funds'' means the receipt of  funds by a museum after November 16, 1990, from a Federal agency through  any grant,   loan, contract (other than a procurement contract), or other arrangement  by which a Federal agency makes or made available to a museum aid in the  form of funds. Federal funds provided for any purpose that are received  by a larger entity of which the museum is a part are considered Federal  funds for the purposes of these regulations. For example, if a museum is  a part of a State or local government or a private university and the  State or local government or private university receives Federal funds  for any purpose, the museum is considered to receive Federal funds for  the purpose of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Museum official means the individual within a museum designated  as being responsible for matters relating to these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, trust,  institution, association, or any other private entity, or, any official,  employee, agent, department, or instrumentality of the United States, or  of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, or of any State or  political subdivision thereof that discovers or discovered human  remains, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural  patrimony on Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who has standing to make a claim under these regulations? (1)  Lineal descendant means an individual tracing his or her ancestry  directly and without interruption by means of the traditional kinship  system of the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization  or by the common law system of descendance to a known Native American  individual whose remains, funerary objects, or sacred objects are being  claimed under these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Native Hawaiian organization means any organization that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Serves and represents the interests of Native Hawaiians;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has as a primary and stated purpose the provision of services to  Native Hawaiians; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has expertise in Native Hawaiian affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term Native Hawaiian means any individual who is a  descendant of the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and  exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the State of  Hawaii. Such organizations must include the Office of Hawaiian Affairs  and Hui Malama I NaKupuna 'O Hawai'i Nei.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indian tribe official means the principal leader of an Indian  tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or the individual officially  designated by the governing body of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization or as otherwise provided by tribal code, policy, or  established procedure as responsible for matters relating to these  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Who is responsible for carrying out these regulations? (1)  Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review Committee means the advisory committee established  pursuant to section 8 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manager, National NAGPRA Program means the official of the  Department of the Interior designated by the Secretary as responsible  for administration of matters relating to this part. Communications to  the Manager, National NAGPRA Program should be sent to the mailing  address listed on the National NAGPRA Contact Information Web site,  http://www.nps.gov/nagpra/CONTACTS/INDEX.HTM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What objects are covered by these regulations? The Act covers  four types of Native American objects. The term Native American means  of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture indigenous to the United  States, including Alaska and Hawaii.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Human remains means the physical remains of the body of a person  of Native American ancestry. The term does not include remains or  portions of remains that may reasonably be determined to have been  freely given or naturally shed by the individual from whose body they  were obtained, such as hair made into ropes or nets. For the purposes of  determining cultural affiliation, human remains incorporated into a  funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony, as  defined below, must be considered as part of that item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Funerary objects means items that, as part of the death rite or  ceremony of   a culture, are reasonably believed to have been placed intentionally at  the time of death or later with or near individual human remains.  Funerary objects must be identified by a preponderance of the evidence  as having been removed from a specific burial site of an individual  affiliated with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization or as being related to specific individuals or families or  to known human remains. The term burial site means any natural or  prepared physical location, whether originally below, on, or above the  surface of the earth, into which, as part of the death rite or ceremony  of a culture, individual human remains were deposited, and includes rock  cairns or pyres which do not fall within the ordinary definition of  gravesite. For purposes of completing the summary requirements in Sec.  10.8 and the inventory requirements of Sec. 10.9:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Associated funerary objects means those funerary objects for  which the human remains with which they were placed intentionally are  also in the possession or control of a museum or Federal agency.  Associated funerary objects also means those funerary objects that were  made exclusively for burial purposes or to contain human remains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unassociated funerary objects means those funerary objects for  which the human remains with which they were placed intentionally are  not in the possession or control of a museum or Federal agency. Objects  that were displayed with individual human remains as part of a death  rite or ceremony of a culture and subsequently returned or distributed  according to traditional custom to living descendants or other  individuals are not considered unassociated funerary objects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sacred objects means items that are specific ceremonial objects  needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice  of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.  While many items, from ancient pottery sherds to arrowheads, might be  imbued with sacredness in the eyes of an individual, these regulations  are specifically limited to objects that were devoted to a traditional  Native American religious ceremony or ritual and which have religious  significance or function in the continued observance or renewal of such  ceremony. The term traditional religious leader means a person who is  recognized by members of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization  as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Being responsible for performing cultural duties relating to the  ceremonial or religious traditions of that Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exercising a leadership role in an Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization based on the tribe or organization's cultural,  ceremonial, or religious practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Objects of cultural patrimony means items having ongoing  historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Indian  tribe or Native Hawaiian organization itself, rather than property owned  by an individual tribal or organization member. These objects are of  such central importance that they may not be alienated, appropriated, or  conveyed by any individual tribal or organization member. Such objects  must have been considered inalienable by the culturally affiliated  Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization at the time the object was  separated from the group. Objects of cultural patrimony include items  such as Zuni War Gods, the Confederacy Wampum Belts of the Iroquois, and  other objects of similar character and significance to the Indian tribe  or Native Hawaiian organization as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What is cultural affiliation? Cultural affiliation means that  there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably  traced historically or prehistorically between members of a present-day  Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and an identifiable earlier  group. Cultural affiliation is established when the preponderance of the  evidence--based on geographical, kinship, biological, archeological,  anthropological, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical  evidence, or other information or expert opinion--reasonably leads to  such a conclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> What does culturally unidentifiable mean? Culturally  unidentifiable refers   to human remains and associated funerary objects in museum or Federal  agency collections for which no lineal descendant or culturally  affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has been  identified through the inventory process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What types of lands do the excavation and discovery provisions  of these regulations apply to? (1) Federal lands means any land other  than tribal lands that are controlled or owned by the United States  Government, including lands selected by but not yet conveyed to Alaska  Native Corporations and groups organized pursuant to the Alaska Native  Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). United States  ``control,'' as used in this definition, refers to those lands not owned  by the United States but in which the United States has a legal interest  sufficient to permit it to apply these regulations without abrogating  the otherwise existing legal rights of a person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tribal lands means all lands which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation  including, but not limited to, allotments held in trust or subject to a  restriction on alienation by the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comprise dependent Indian communities as recognized pursuant to  18 U.S.C. 1151; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Are administered for the benefit of Native Hawaiians pursuant  to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and section 4 of the  Hawaiian Statehood Admission Act (Pub.L. 86-3; 73 Stat. 6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Actions authorized or required under these regulations will not  apply to tribal lands to the extent that any action would result in a  taking of property without compensation within the meaning of the Fifth  Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> What procedures are required by these regulations? (1) Summary  means the written description of collections that may contain  unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural  patrimony required by Sec. 10.8 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inventory means the item-by-item description of human remains  and associated funerary objects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Intentional excavation means the planned archeological removal  of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of  cultural patrimony found under or on the surface of Federal or tribal  lands pursuant to section 3 (c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inadvertent discovery means the unanticipated encounter or  detection of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects  of cultural patrimony found under or on the surface of Federal or tribal  lands pursuant to section 3 (d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disposition means the transfer of control over Native American  human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural  patrimony by a museum or Federal agency under this part. This part  establishes disposition procedures for several different situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and  objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally from, or  discovered inadvertently on, Federal or tribal lands after November 16,  1990, is established under Sec. 10.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Repatriation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred  objects, and objects of cultural patrimony in museum and Federal agency  collections to a lineal descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe  or Native Hawaiian organization is established under Sec. 10.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains, with  or without associated funerary objects, in museum or Federal agency  collections is established under Sec. 10.11.  [60 FR 62158, Dec. 4, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 41293, Aug. 1, 1997; 70  FR 57179, Sept. 30, 2005; 71 FR 16501, Apr. 3, 2006; 75 FR 12403, Mar.  15, 2010; 76 FR 39009, July 5, 2011; 78 FR 27082, May 9, 2013]    Subpart B_Human Remains, Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, or Objects of</p><p class="depth0">Cultural Patrimony From Federal or Tribal Lands</p>
