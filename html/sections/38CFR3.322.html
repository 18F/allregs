                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aggravation of preservice disability. In cases involving  aggravation by active service, the rating will reflect only the degree  of disability over and above the degree of disability existing at the  time of entrance into active service, whether the particular condition  was noted at the time of entrance into active service, or whether it is  determined upon the evidence of record to have existed at that time. It  is necessary to deduct from the present evaluation the degree, if  ascertainable, of the disability existing at the time of entrance into  active service, in terms of the rating schedule except that if the  disability is total (100 percent) no deduction will be made. If the  degree of disability at the time of entrance into service is not  ascertainable in terms of the schedule, no deduction will be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aggravation of service-connected disability. Where a disease or  injury incurred in peacetime service is aggravated during service in a  period of war, or conversely, where a disease or injury incurred in  service during a period of war is aggravated during peacetime service,  the entire disability flowing from the disease or injury will be service  connected based on the war service.</p><p class="depth2">Cross References: Principles relating to service connection.
