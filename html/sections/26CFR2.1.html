Such construction reserve fund shall be established, maintained, expended, and used in accordance with the provisions of this section and rules or regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of the sale or actual or constructive total loss of a vessel, if the taxpayer deposits an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale or to the net indemnity with respect to the loss in a construction reserve fund established under subsection (b), then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the taxpayer so elects in his income-tax return for the taxable year in which the gain was realized, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, if the taxpayer so elects prior to the expiration of sixty days after the receipt of the payment or indemnity, and in accordance with a form of election to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,
no gain shall be recognized to the taxpayer in respect of such sale or indemnification in the computation of net income for the purposes of Federal income or excess-profits taxes. If an election is made under subdivision (2) and if computation or recomputation in accordance with this subsection is otherwise allowable but is prevented, on the date of making such election or within six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation, such computation or recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making such election.</p><p class="depth0">For the purposes of this subsection no amount shall be considered as deposited in a construction reserve fund unless it is deposited within sixty days after it is received by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">As used in this subsection the term net proceeds and the term net indemnity mean the sum of (1) the adjusted basis of the vessel and (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized to the taxpayer without regard to this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation, for the purposes of Federal income or excess profits taxes, of any new vessel constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as provided in subsection (g), in whole or in part out of the construction reserve fund shall be reduced by that portion of the deposits in the fund expended in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, acquisition, or liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness of the new vessel which represents gain not recognized for tax purposes under subsection (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For the purposes of this section, (1) if the net proceeds of a sale or the net indemnity in respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the amount consisting of the gain shall be considered as first deposited; (2) amounts expended, obligated, or otherwise withdrawn shall be applied against the amounts deposited in the fund in the order of deposit; and (3) if any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under subsection (c), any expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist of gain in the proportion that the part of the deposit consisting of gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> With respect to any taxable year, amounts on deposit on the last day of such year in a construction reserve fund in accordance with this section and with respect to which all the requirements of subsection (g) have been satisfied, to the extent that such requirements are applicable as of the last day of said taxable year, shall not constitute an accumulation of earnings or profits within the meaning of section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code [Part I (section 531 and following), Subchapter A, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The provisions of subsections (c) and (f) shall apply to any deposit in the construction reserve fund only to the extent that such deposit is expended or obligated for expenditure, in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Commission, for a part interest therein), or, with the approval of the Commission, for the reconstruction or reconditioning of a new vessel or vessels, entered into within (i) two years from the date of deposit or the date of any extension thereof which may be granted by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 511(h), in the case of deposits made prior to the date [July 17, 1952] on which these amendatory provisions become effective, or (ii) three years from the date of such deposit in the case of a deposit made after such effective date, only if under such rules and regulations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Within such period not less than 12\1/2\ per centum of the construction or contract price of the vessel or vessels is paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof and the plans and specifications therefor are approved by the Commission to the extent by it deemed necessary;

If any such deposited gain or portion thereof with respect to a deposit made in any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945, is so included in gross income for such taxable year, there shall (in addition to any other deficiency) be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as if it were a deficiency, an amount equal to 1.1 per centum of the amount of gain so included, such amount being in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any deficiency in tax for any taxable year resulting from the inclusion of any amount in gross income as provided by subsection (i), and the amount to be treated as a deficiency under such subsection in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax, may be assessed or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time: Provided, however, That interest on any such deficiency or amount to be treated as a deficiency shall not begin until the date the deposited gain or portion thereof in question is required under subsection (i) to be included in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> This section shall be applicable to a taxpayer only in respect of sales or indemnifications for losses occurring within a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and only in respect of earnings derived during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> For the purposes of this section a vessel shall be considered as constructed or acquired by the taxpayer if constructed or acquired by a corporation at a time when the taxpayer owns at least 95 per centum of the total number of shares of each class of stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> The terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> The terms contract for the construction and construction contract, as used in this section, shall include, in the case of a taxpayer who constructs a new vessel in a shipyard owned by such taxpayer, an agreement between such taxpayer and the Commission with respect to such construction and containing provisions deemed necessary or advisable by the Commission to carry out the purposes and policy of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> The terms reconstruction and reconditioning, as used in this section, shall include the reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization of a vessel for exclusive use on the Great Lakes, including the St. Lawrence River and Gulf, if the Commission determines that the objectives of this Act will be promoted by such reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization, and, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, such vessel shall be deemed to be a ``new vessel'' within the meaning of this section for such reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization.
