                                Sec. 405.1046  Notice of an ALJ decision.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Unless the ALJ dismisses the hearing, the ALJ will issue a written decision that gives the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the reasons for the decision. The decision must be based on evidence offered at the hearing or otherwise admitted into the record. The ALJ mails a copy of the decision to all the parties at their last known address, to the QIC that issued the reconsideration determination, and to the contractor that issued the initial determination. For overpayment cases involving multiple beneficiaries, where there is no beneficiary liability, the ALJ may choose to send written notice only to the appellant. In the event a payment will be made to a provider or supplier in conjunction with this ALJ decision, the contractor must also issue a revised electronic or paper remittance advice to that provider or supplier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of the notice. The decision must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by a beneficiary and must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific reasons for the determination, including, to the extent appropriate, a summary of any clinical or scientific evidence used in making the determination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures for obtaining additional information concerning the decision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of the right to appeal the decision to the MAC, including instructions on how to initiate an appeal under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on decision. When the amount of payment for an item or service is an issue before the ALJ, the ALJ may make a finding as to the amount of payment due. If the ALJ makes a finding concerning payment when the amount of payment was not an issue before the ALJ, the contractor may independently determine the payment amount. In either of the aforementioned situations, an ALJ's decision is not binding on the contractor for purposes of determining the amount of payment due. The amount of payment determined by the contractor in effectuating the ALJ's decision is a new initial determination under Sec. 405.924.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of decision. The ALJ issues a decision by the end of the 90 calendar day period beginning on the date when the request for hearing is received by the entity specified in the QIC's reconsideration, unless the 90 calendar day period is extended as provided in Sec. 405.1016.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recommended decision. An ALJ issues a recommended decision if he or she is directed to do so in the MAC's remand order. An ALJ may not issue a recommended decision on his or her own motion. The ALJ mails a copy of the recommended decision to all the parties at their last known address.
