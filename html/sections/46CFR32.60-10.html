                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The galleys, living quarters, navigation spaces,  general cargo spaces, boiler rooms, and enclosed spaces where sources of  vapor ignition are normally present, shall be segregated from cargo  tanks by cofferdams or pump rooms or tanks, either empty or used to  carry liquid having a flashpoint of 150 F. or above, or deck spaces  enclosed or open.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cargo tank spaces. Cargo tank spaces shall extend to the main  deck, with hatches and vents located on the weather deck. Liquids having  a flash point of not less than 150 F. may be carried in the bulk tanks  located beyond the segregating cofferdams and/or pump rooms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enclosed spaces. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cargo and vent piping passing through  enclosed spaces immediately above the bulk cargo tanks shall be  continuous except that flanged joints connecting pipe sections will be  permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No openings to cargo tank shall be permitted other than stuffing  boxes through which valve control rods or permanently installed gage  tapes extend and openings for use of tank cleaning machines. Openings  for tank cleaning machines, when not in use, shall be kept closed by  means of gastight bolted plates and when in use shall be made  essentially gas and watertight by covers through which hose or pipe to  the tank cleaning machines extend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The overhead in way of quarters shall be gastight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stowage spaces. The spaces described in paragraph (c) of this  section may be used for stowage purposes and for general cargo provided  that adequate ventilation is furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Openings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section, there shall be no manholes or other openings from cargo tanks  to any other enclosed spaces. An exception may be made to allow direct  access from cargo tanks to innerbottoms through gas tight bolted  manholes, provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The innerbottom tanks are voids or ballast tanks only, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The innerbottom tanks are protected from sources of ignition  similar to the cargo tanks, and any bilge or ballast pumping system  serving the innerbottom tanks are treated like cargo pumping systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any vents, sounding tubes, and similar piping passing through  such tanks shall be run in a suitable trunk;   or such piping shall have a wall thickness equal to or greater than the  innerbottom plating, but not less than schedule 80, and shall be welded  continuously on both sides of the innerbottom plating.
