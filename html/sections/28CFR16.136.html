                                Sec.  16.136  Exemption of the Department of Justice, Giglio Information
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Justice, Giglio Information Files (JUSTICE/ DOJ-017) system of records is exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4);  (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5),  and (8); (f); and (g) of the Privacy Act. These exemptions apply only to  the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and/or (k).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because this subsection is inapplicable  to the extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because this subsection is inapplicable  to the extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in  this system may interfere with or impede an ongoing investigation as it  may be related to allegations against an agent or witness who is  currently being investigated. Further, other records that are derivative  of the subject's employing agency files may be accessed through the  employing agency's files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because it may not be possible to  determine in advance if potential impeachment records collected and  maintained in order to sufficiently meet the Department's Giglio  requirements and obligations are all relevant and necessary. In order to  ensure that the Department's prosecutors and investigative agencies  receive sufficient information to meet their obligations under Giglio,  it is appropriate to maintain potential impeachment information in  accordance with Department policy as such records could later be  relevant and necessary in a different case in which the same witness or  affiant subsequently testifies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information directly  from the subject individual could serve notice that the individual is  the subject of investigation and because of the nature of the records in  this system, which are used to impeach or demonstrate bias of a witness,  requires that the information be collected from others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because federal law enforcement officers  receive notice from their supervisors and prosecuting attorneys that  impeachment information may be used at trial. Law enforcement officers  are also given notice by the Giglio decision itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because this system of  records is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection  (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because it may not be possible to  determine in advance if all potential impeachment records collected and  maintained in order to sufficiently meet the Department's Giglio  requirements and obligations are all accurate, relevant, timely,   and complete at the time of collection. Although the Department has  policies in place to verify the records, the records may be originated  from another agency, third party, or open source media and it may be  impossible to ensure the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and  completeness of potential impeachment information maintained prior to  and during the process of being verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because the nature of the Giglio  discovery process renders notice of compliance with the compulsory  discovery process impractical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> From subsections (f) and (g) because these subsections are  inapplicable to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific  subsections of the Privacy Act.
