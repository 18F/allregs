true, correct, and complete and conforms to all applicable laws and regulations, provided that this certification may be qualified in writing, but only to the extent the qualification(s) are permitted under 26 CFR 301.6059-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Alternative compliance for plan valuation report. If any of the information specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section is not available by the date specified in Sec. 4010.10(a), a filer may satisfy the requirement to provide such information by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Including a statement, with the material that is submitted to PBGC, that the filer will file the unavailable information by the alternative due date specified in Sec. 4010.11(b), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filing such information (along with a certification by an enrolled actuary under paragraph (a)(12) of this section) with PBGC by that alternative due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exempt plan. The actuarial information specified in this section is not required with respect to a plan if the plan satisfies the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) through (3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has fewer than 500 participants as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year or as of the valuation date for that plan year and has a 4010 funding shortfall (as defined in Sec. 4010.11(c)) for the plan year ending within the information year that is not in excess of $15 million, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has benefit liabilities as of the end of the plan year ending within the filer's information year, (determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) equal to or less than the fair market value of the plan's assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plan has received, by or within ten days after the due dates, all required installments or other payments required to be made during the information year under ERISA sections 302 and 303 and Code sections 412 and 430.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan has no outstanding minimum funding waivers (as described in Sec. 4010.4(a)(3)) as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Value of benefit liabilities. The value of a plan's benefit liabilities at the end of a plan year must be determined using the plan census data described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the actuarial assumptions and methods described in paragraph (d)(2)

or, where applicable, (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Census data--(i) Census data period. Plan census data must be determined (for all plans for any information year) either as of the end of the plan year or as of the beginning of the next plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Projected census data. If actual plan census data are not available, a plan may use a projection of plan census data from a date within the plan year. The projection must be consistent with projections used to measure pension obligations of the plan for financial statement purposes and must give a result appropriate for the end of the plan year for these obligations. For example, adjustments to the projection process are required where there has been a significant event (such as a plan amendment or a plant shutdown) that has not been reflected in the projection data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actuarial assumptions and methods. The value of benefit liabilities must be determined using the following rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assumptions included in Secs. 4044.51 through 4044.57. Interest, expenses, mortality and retirement assumptions must be as prescribed in Secs. 4044.51 through 4044.57 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assumptions not included in Secs. 4044.51 through 4044.57. Assumptions for decrements other than mortality and retirement (such as turnover or disability) used to determine the minimum required contribution under ERISA section 303 and Code section 430 for the plan year ending within the filer's information year may be used, but only if all such assumptions are used. For plans where there is no distinction between termination and retirement assumptions, any termination/retirement rates at ages after the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date (as defined in Sec. 4022.10 of this chapter) must be treated as retirement rates and replaced by expected retirement ages; termination/retirement rates at ages below the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date must be treated as pre-retirement decrements. Assumptions used to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan year ending within the filer's information year, other than assumptions for decrements, interest, and expenses (e.g., form of payment, cost-of-living increases, marital status), must be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Benefits to be valued. Benefits to be valued include all benefits earned or accrued under the plan as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year and other benefits payable from the plan including, but not limited to, ancillary benefits and retirement supplements, regardless of whether such benefits are protected by the anti-cutback provisions of Code section 411(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Future service. Future service expected to be accrued by an active participant in an ongoing plan during future employment (based on the assumptions used to determine benefit liabilities) must be included in determining the earliest and unreduced retirement ages used to determine the expected retirement age and in determining an active participant's entitlement to early retirement subsidies and supplements at the expected retirement age. See the examples in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special actuarial assumptions for exempt plan determination. Solely for purposes of determining whether a plan is an exempt plan for an information year, the value of benefit liabilities may be determined by substituting for the retirement age assumptions in paragraph (d)(2) of this section the retirement age assumptions used by the plan for the plan year ending within the information year for purposes of section 303 of ERISA without regard to the at-risk assumption of subsection 303(i) of ERISA and Code section 430 without regard to the at-risk assumption of subsection 430(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples demonstrate how XRA is determined and applied for purposes of determining benefit liabilities under paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Example 1. (i) Facts. Plan X has a normal retirement age of 65, but allows benefits to commence as early as age 55 for participants who complete at least 10 years of service before termination. Early retirement benefits are reduced for participants with fewer than 25 years of service. Employee A is an active participant who is age 40 and has

completed 5 years of service. Assume the ``medium'' XRA look-up table applies, and that for purposes of Sec. 4010.8(d), the filer has decided not to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality table into account as permitted under Sec. 4010.8(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of XRA. If A continues working, the earliest age A could start receiving benefit is age 55. Therefore, A's earliest retirement age at valuation (ERA) is 55. Because the earliest that A can receive an unreduced benefit is when A completed 25 years of service (at age 60), A's URA is age 60. Under the medium XRA look-up table, A's XRA is 58.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of Benefit Liabilities. The benefit liability is the present value of A's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming A retires at age 58 and elects to have benefits commence immediately. Since A will not be eligible to receive unreduced benefits at that time, the accrued benefit is reduced in accordance with the plan's early retirement reduction provisions, including any subsidies to which A will be entitled under the assumption that A works until age 58.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example 2. Employee B is also an active participant in plan X and is age 40 with 15 years of service. B will complete 25 years of service at age 50. However, because the plan does not allow for benefit commencement before age 55, B's ERA, URA and thus, XRA are all age 55. The benefit liability is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires at age 55 and elects to commence benefits immediately. Since B will be eligible to receive an unreduced benefit at that time, the full unreduced benefit amount is valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example 3--(i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that for purposes of Sec. 4010.8(d), the filer has decided to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality into account as permitted under Sec. 4010.8(d)(2)(i). Assume the only pre-retirement decrement other than mortality is turnover. The plan's turnover rates go from age 21 to age 54, and the retirement rates go from age 55 to age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of XRA. If A terminates employment at or before age 45, A will not be eligible to receive benefits until age 65. Therefore, the portion of Employee A that is assumed to terminate before age 45 has an ERA, URA, and XRA of age 65. The portion of A that remains in service to age 45, after the application of the applicable turnover decrements, and then terminates at or after age 45, but before age 55, will be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as 55. Therefore, the portion of A that is assumed to terminate during this period has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65 and an XRA of 60. Since the turnover rates stop at age 55, the portion of A that remains in service to age 55 is assumed to remain in service until the XRA for that portion of A. For that portion of A, the ERA is 55, the URA is 60 and the XRA is 58. (For purposes of Sec. 4010.8(d), the plan's assumed retirement rates are replaced by XRAs.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of benefit liabilities. The benefit liability of A is the sum of the present value of A's full accrued benefit at age 65 for the portion of A that terminates between age 40 and age 45, the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 60 for the portion of A that terminates between age 45 and age 54, and the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 58 for the portion of A that remains employed until age 55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee B, the sole active participant, is age 40 with 15 years of service. The portion of B that is assumed to terminate before age 50 would be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as age 55 or an unreduced benefit at age 65. That portion of B has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65, and an XRA of 60. The benefit liability for that portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B commences a reduced benefit at age 60. The portion of B that survives to age 50 would be entitled to receive an unreduced benefit as early as age 55. That portion of B has an ERA, URA and XRA of 55. The benefit liability for this portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires and commences unreduced payments at age 55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Multiple employer plans. If, with respect to a multiple employer plan, the actuarial information required under this section 4010 for the plan year ending within the filer's information year has been filed under part 4010 by another filer, the filer may include this actuarial information by reference. The filer must report the name, EIN and plan number of the multiple employer plan and the name of the other filer that submitted this information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Previous filing for plan year. If the actuarial information for the plan year as required under this Sec. 4010.8 has been submitted by the filer in a previous 4010 submission, the filing may include that actuarial information by reference to the previous submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rules for plan years beginning before 2008. For plan years beginning before 2008:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (a) (5) through (8) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The references in paragraph (a)(9) of this section to ERISA section 303(k) and Code section 430(k) are replaced with references to sections of ERISA and the Code, as in effect before amendment by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Instead of the requirement of paragraph (a)(11) of this section, the actuarial valuation report requirements in Sec. 4010.8(a)(5) in effect as of December 31, 2007, apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plans subject to special funding rules under sections 104, 105, 106 and 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Instead of the requirements of paragraph (a)(11) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a plan year for which the application of new funding rules is deferred for a plan under sections 104, 105, and 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-280 (dealing with plans of certain rural cooperatives, certain plans affected by settlement agreement with PBGC, and certain plans of government contractors), the requirements in Sec. 4010.8(a)(5) (in connection with the actuarial valuation report) in effect as of December 31, 2007, apply to the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan year for which a plan is subject to section 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (dealing with certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline caterers), the plan must meet the requirements in connection with the actuarial valuation report in accordance with instructions on PBGC's Web site, http://www.pbgc.gov.
