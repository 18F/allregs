                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appeals and motions before the Board--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a fee is  required. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a  filing fee prescribed in 8 CFR 1103.7, or a fee waiver request pursuant  to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, is required in connection with the  filing of an appeal, a motion to reopen, or a motion to reconsider  before the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a fee is not required. A filing fee is not required in the  following instances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A custody bond appeal filed pursuant to Sec. 1003.1(b)(7);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A motion to reopen that is based exclusively on an application  for relief that does not require a fee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A motion to reconsider that is based exclusively on a prior  application for relief that did not require a fee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A motion filed while an appeal, a motion to reopen, or a motion  to reconsider is already pending before the Board;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A motion requesting only a stay of removal, deportation, or  exclusion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any appeal or motion filed by the Department of Homeland  Security;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A motion that is agreed upon by all parties and is jointly  filed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> An appeal or motion filed under a law, regulation, or  directive that specifically does not require a filing fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a fee may be waived. The Board has the discretion to waive  a fee for an appeal, motion to reconsider, or motion to reopen upon a  showing that the filing party is unable to pay the fee. Fee waivers  shall be requested through the filing of a Fee Waiver Request (Form  EOIR-26A), including the declaration to be signed under penalty of  perjury substantiating the filing party's inability to pay the fee. The  fee waiver request shall be filed along with the Notice of Appeal or the  motion. If the fee waiver request does not establish the inability to  pay the required fee, the appeal or motion will not be deemed properly  filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method of payment. When a fee is required for an appeal or  motion, the fee shall accompany the appeal or motion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this  section, the fee for filing an appeal or motion with the Board shall be  paid by check, money order, or electronic payment in a manner and form  authorized by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. When paid by  check or money   order, the fee shall be payable to the ``United States Department of  Justice,'' drawn on a bank or other institution that is located within  the United States, and payable in United States currency. The check or  money order shall bear the full name and alien registration number of  the alien. A payment that is uncollectible does not satisfy a fee  requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appeals from Department of Homeland Security decisions. The fee  for filing an appeal, within the jurisdiction of the Board, from the  decision of a Department of Homeland Security officer shall be paid to  the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applications for relief. Fees for applications for relief are  not collected by the Board, but instead are paid to the Department of  Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7. When a motion before  the Board is based upon an application for relief, only the fee for the  motion to reopen shall be paid to the Board, and payment of the fee for  the application for relief shall not accompany the motion. If the motion  is granted and proceedings are remanded to the immigration judge, the  application fee shall be paid in the manner specified in 8 CFR  1003.24(c)(1).  [69 FR 44906, July 28, 2004]</p>
