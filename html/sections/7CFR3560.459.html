                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Deceased borrower, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce actions. The Agency will address borrower accounts affected by special circumstances such as death, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce on a case-by-case basis. The Agency will make servicing decisions in such cases on the basis of best interest to the Federal Government and tenants. The Agency will bring a legal action to establish the legal capacity of the borrower to administer the project if found necessary to protect the government's interests. In order for the Agency to make servicing decisions in such cases, the borrower or the borrower's representative will provide to the Agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the part of the heirs or executor of the borrower's estate, evidence of legal action due to a will or court actions that establish who is to become the owner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The financial status of the borrower and any member pledging additional security for the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The status of the security property; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The impact of the identified actions on the operation of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Membership liability agreements. If a borrower's note is endorsed by individuals other than the borrower or a borrower has security agreements with members of the organization for the purchase of shares of stock or for the payment of a pro rata share of the loan in the event of default, or has individual liability agreements, which are usually assigned to and held by the Agency as additional security for the loan, the security and liability agreements must be adequate to protect the Agency's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Security issues in participation loans. When a multi-family housing (MFH) project is receiving financing or a subsidy from sources other than the Agency, the Agency will service the account in accordance with the participation agreements made with the Agency and the other funding sources under Sec. 3560.65.</p>
