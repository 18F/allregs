                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The debtor may offer to enter into a written agreement with the  Corporation to repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an  offer and the decision to enter into such a written agreement is at the  discretion of the Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because payment  of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the Corporation  shall analyze the debtor's financial condition. The Corporation may  enter into a written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to  repay the debt in installments if the Corporation determines, in its  sole discretion, that payment of the amount due would create an undue  financial hardship for the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth  the amount and frequency of installment payments and shall, in  accordance with Sec. 1408.12, provide for the imposition of charges for  interest, penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the  Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a  confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments  will exceed $750. The Corporation shall provide the debtor with a  written explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment  note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the  written explanation. The statement shall recite that the written  explanation was read and understood before execution of the note and  that the debtor signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Documentation  of these procedures will be maintained in the Corporation's file on the  debtor.</p>
