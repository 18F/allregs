If the Commandant grants an exemption pursuant to this paragraph he communicates the details of the exemption and the reasons therefor to the chairman of the board of Steamship Inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A vessel that is not normally engaged on voyages to which this part applies but that, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single such voyage between two specific ports may be exempted by the Commandant from any of the requirements of this part, if the ship complies with safety requirements that, in the opinion of the Commandant are adequate for the voyage that is to be undertaken by the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unmanned dry cargo river barges carrying non-hazardous cargoes on certain routes on Lake Michigan may be exempted from load line requirements in accordance with the conditions specified in subpart E of this part.
