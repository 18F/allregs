                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Most employers are required by section 6109 of the  Internal Revenue Code and by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations  at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)-1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN)  and to include it on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who  does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required to  file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this  requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form SS-4,  ``Application for Employer Identification Number,'' with the IRS. For  the convenience of employers, Form SS-4 is available at all SSA and IRS  offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic  corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of  foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents of the U.S. may be  assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State and local governments. When a State submits a modification  to its agreement under section 218 of the Act, which extends coverage to  periods prior to 1987, SSA will assign a special identification number  to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will  send the State a Form SSA-214-CD, ``Notice of Identifying Number,'' to  inform the State of the special identification number(s). The special  number will be used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special  number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre- 1987 coverage is obtained and SSA will send a Form SSA-214-CD to the  interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.  [60 FR 42433, Aug. 16, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 33016, June 21, 1999]</p>
