                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under these regulations, the applicant must be a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. An applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in Subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The categories of eligible applicants are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Charitable or other tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cooperative associations as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individuals with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sole owners of unincorporated businesses if the owner has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and if the business has not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All other partnerships, corporations, associations, local governmental units, and public and private organizations with a net worth of not more than $7 million and with not more than 500 employees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where an award is sought on the basis stated in Sec. 13.5(c) of this part, small entities as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of determining eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant is calculated as of the date the proceeding was initiated. The net worth of an applicant is determined by generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether an applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an ``individual'' or a ``sole owner of an unincorporated business'' will be determined by whether the applicant's participation in the proceeding is related primarily to individual interests or to business interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The employees of an applicant include all those persons regularly providing services for remuneration for

the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An applicant is not eligible if it appears from the facts and circumstances that it has participated in the proceedings only or primarily on behalf of other persons or entities that are ineligible.
