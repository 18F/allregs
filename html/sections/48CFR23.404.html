                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency must establish an affirmative procurement program for  EPA and USDA-designated items if the agency's purchases of designated  items exceed the threshold set forth in 23.400.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies have a period of 1 year to revise their procurement  program(s) after the designation of any new item by EPA or USDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical or requirements personnel and procurement personnel  are responsible for the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of  affirmative procurement programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agency affirmative procurement programs must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A recovered materials and biobased products preference program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An agency promotion program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For EPA-designated items only, a program for requiring  reasonable estimates, certification, and verification of recovered  material used in the performance of contracts. Both the recovered  material content and biobased programs require preaward certification  that the products meet EPA or USDA recommendations. A second  certification is required at contract completion for recovered material  content; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agency affirmative procurement programs must  require that 100 percent of purchases of EPA or USDA-designated items  contain recovered material or biobased content, respectively, unless the  item cannot be acquired--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Competitively within a reasonable time frame;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Meeting reasonable performance standards; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At a reasonable price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA and USDA may provide categorical exemptions for items that  they designate, when procured for a specific purpose. For example, all  USDA-designated items (see 7 CFR 3201.3(e)) are exempt from the  preferred procurement requirement for the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spacecraft system and launch support equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Military equipment, i.e., a product or system designed or  procured for combat or combat-related missions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency affirmative procurement programs must provide guidance  for purchases of EPA-designated items at or below the micro-purchase  threshold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agencies may use their own specifications or commercial product  descriptions when procuring products containing recovered materials or  biobased products. When using either, the contract should specify--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For products containing recovered materials, that the product is  composed of the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Highest percent of recovered materials practicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum content standards in accordance with EPA's Recovered  Materials Advisory Notices; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For biobased products, that the product is composed of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The highest percentage of biobased material practicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> USDA's recommended minimum contents standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agencies shall treat as eligible for the preference for biobased  products, products from ``designated countries,'' as defined in 25.003,  provided that those products--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the criteria for the definition of biobased product, except  that the products need not meet the requirement that renewable  agricultural materials or forestry materials in such product must be  domestic; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise meet all requirements for participation in the  preference program.
