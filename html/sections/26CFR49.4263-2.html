                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The tax imposed by section 4261 does not apply to  transportation payments of 60 cents or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Round trips. The exemption is determined by the amount paid for  a single one-way trip. Thus, an amount of more than 60 cents paid for  round-trip transportation is exempt from the tax, if the regular one-way  single fare of like class between the terminal points of the round trip  does not exceed 60 cents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charters. An amount paid for the charter of a car, train, motor  vehicle, aircraft, or boat with respect to transportation beginning  before November 16, 1962, or of an aircraft with respect to  transportation beginning after November 15, 1962, is exempt from the  tax, if the payment represents a per capita charge of sixty cents or  less for each person actually transported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Seating or sleeping accommodations. Any amount paid for seating  or sleeping accommodations is not subject to tax under section 4261(c)  where the amount of the related payment for transportation is 60 cents  or less. However, where the payment for transportation exceeds 60 cents,  a payment for seating or sleeping accommodations in connection with such  transportation is subject to the tax regardless of the amount thereof.
