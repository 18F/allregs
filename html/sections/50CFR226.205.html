                            <p class="depth0">The following areas consisting of the water, waterway bottom, and  adjacent riparian zone of specified lakes and river reaches in  hydrologic units presently or historically accessible to listed Snake  River salmon (except reaches above impassable natural falls, and  Dworshak and Hells Canyon Dams). Adjacent riparian zones are defined as  those areas within a horizontal distance of 300 feet (91.4 m) from the  normal line of high water of a stream channel (600 feet or 182.8 m, when  both sides of the stream channel are included) or from the shoreline of  a standing body of water. The complete text delineating critical habitat  for each species follows. Hydrologic units (table 3) are those defined  by the Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  publication, ``Hydrologic Unit Maps, United States Geological Survey  Water Supply Paper 2294, 1987'', and the following DOI, USGS, 1:500,000  scale hydrologic unit map: State of Oregon, 1974; State of Washington,  1974; State of Idaho, 1974, which are incorporated by reference. This  incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal  Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of  the USGS publication and maps may be obtained from the USGS, Map Sales,  Box 25286, Denver, CO 80225.
