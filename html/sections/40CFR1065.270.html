                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. You may use a chemiluminescent detector (CLD) to measure NOX concentration in raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling. We generally accept a CLD for NOX measurement, even though it measures only NO and NO2, when coupled with an NO2-to-NO converter, since conventional engines and aftertreatment systems do not emit significant amounts of NOX species other than NO and NO2. Measure other NOX species if required by the standard-setting part. While you may also use other instruments to measure NOX, as described in Sec.  1065.272, use a reference procedure based on a chemiluminescent detector for comparison with any proposed alternate measurement procedure under Sec.  1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Component requirements. We recommend that you use a CLD that meets the specifications in Table 1 of Sec.  1065.205. Note that your CLD-based system must meet the quench verification in Sec.  1065.370 and it must also meet the linearity verification in Sec.  1065.307. You may use a heated or unheated CLD, and you may use a CLD that operates at atmospheric pressure or under a vacuum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NO2-to-NO converter. Place upstream of the CLD an internal or external NO2-to-NO converter that meets the verification in Sec.  1065.378. Configure the converter with a bypass line if it is needed to facilitate this verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Humidity effects. You must maintain all CLD temperatures to prevent aqueous condensation. If you remove humidity from a sample upstream of a CLD, use one of the following configurations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Connect a CLD downstream of any dryer or chiller that is downstream of an NO2-to-NO converter that meets the verification in Sec.  1065.378.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Connect a CLD downstream of any dryer or thermal chiller that meets the verification in Sec.  1065.376.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Response time. You may use a heated CLD to improve CLD response time.
