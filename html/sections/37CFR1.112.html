Applicant or patent owner may reply to such Office action in the same manner provided in Sec.  1.111 or Sec.  1.945, with or without amendment, unless such Office action indicates that it is made final (Sec.  1.113) or an appeal (Sec.  41.31 of this title) has been taken (Sec.  1.116), or in an inter partes reexamination, that it is an action closing prosecution (Sec.  1.949) or a right of appeal notice (Sec.  1.953).
