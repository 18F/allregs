                                Sec. 233.37  How monthly reports are treated and what notices are

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What happens if a completed monthly report is received on time. When the agency receives a completed monthly report as specified in Sec. 233.36, and if all eligibility conditions are met, it shall process the payment. The agency shall notify the recipient of any changes from the prior payment and the basis for its determinations. This notice must meet the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) of this chapter on adequate notice if the payment is being reduced or assistance is terminated as a result of information provided in the monthly report. The notice must be mailed to arrive no later than the resulting payment or in lieu of the payment. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What happens if a completed monthly report is not received by the agency. An agency may terminate assistance if it has received no report or has received only an incomplete report as defined by the State. In this case, the agency must send the recipient a notice meeting the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) to arrive not later than the date it would have made payment if the agency had received a completed monthly report on time. If the recipient notifies the agency and files a completed report within 10 days of the date of this notice, the agency must accept the replacement form and make a payment based on the information on the form if the information indicates that the person is still eligible (without the applicable earned income disregards if the State agency determines no good cause exists for failing to file a timely report of earnings). If the recipient is found ineligible or eligible for an amount less than the prior month's payment, the State must promptly notify the recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing and his or her right to have assistance reinstated. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What happens if a completed monthly report is received but is not timely. States must specify in their plans a definition of timeliness related to the filing of a monthly report and the number of days an individual has to report changes in earnings which impact eligibility. States must inform recipients what constitutes timeliness and that no disregard of earnings as described in Sec. 233.20(a)(11) (i) and (ii)(B) ($30 and one-third, child care, and work expenses) will be applied to any earnings which are not reported in a timely manner without good cause. The State must provide recipients an opportunity to show good cause for not filing a timely report of earnings. If the State finds good cause, then applicable earned income disregards will be applied in determining payment. If the State does not find good cause, then applicable earned income disregards will not be applied. If the recipient is found ineligible or eligible for an amount less than the prior month's payment, the State must promptly notify the recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing and his or her right to have assistance reinstated. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.
