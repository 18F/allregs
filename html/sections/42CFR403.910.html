                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Certain research payments or other transfers of  value made to a covered recipient by an applicable manufacturer under a  product research or development agreement may be delayed from  publication on the Web site. Publication of a payment or other transfer  of value is delayed when made in connection with the following  instances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research on or development of a new drug, device, biological, or  medical supply, or a new application of an existing drug, device,  biological, or medical supply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clinical investigations regarding a new drug, device,  biological, or medical supply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Research or development agreement. The research or development  agreement must include a written agreement, a research protocol, or both  between the applicable manufacturer and covered recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date of publication. Payments or other transfers of value  eligible for delayed publication must be reported to CMS (in the manner  required in Sec. 403.904(f)) on the first reporting date following the  year in which they occur, but CMS does not publicly post the payment  until the first annual publication date after the earlier of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of the approval, licensure or clearance of the covered  drug, device, biological, or medical supply by FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Four calendar years after the date the payment or other transfer  of value was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification of delayed publication. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicable  manufacturer must indicate on its research report to CMS whether a  payment or other transfer of value is eligible for a delay in  publication. The absence of this indication in the report will result in  CMS posting all payments publicly in the first year of public reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An applicable manufacturer must continue to indicate annually in  its report that FDA approval, licensure, or clearance of the new drug,  device, biological or medical supply to which the payment or other  transfer of value is related, is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An applicable manufacturer must notify CMS during subsequent  annual submissions, if the new drug, device, biological or medical  supply, to which the payment is related (or the new application of the  existing drug, device, biological, or medical supply), is approved by  the FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to notify CMS when FDA approval occurs may be considered  failure to report, and the applicable manufacturer may be subject to  civil monetary penalties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If, after 4 years from the date of a payment first appearing in  a report to CMS, there is an indication in a report that the payment is  subject to delayed reporting, it is reported regardless of the  indication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Confidentiality. Information submitted and eligible for delayed  publication is considered confidential and will not be subject to  disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552, or any similar Federal, State, or local  law, until on or after the date on which the information made available  to the public as required in this section.</p>
