                                Sec.  141.72  Disinfection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not  provide filtration treatment must provide the disinfection treatment  specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 30, 1991,  unless the State determines that filtration is required in writing  pursuant to Sec.  1412 (b)(7)(C)(iii). A public water system that uses a  ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and does  not provide filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment  specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 30, 1991,  or 18 months after the State determines that the ground water source is  under the influence of surface water, whichever is later, unless the  State has determined that filtration is required in writing pursuant to  Sec.  1412(b)(7)(C)(iii). If the State has determined that filtration is  required,   the system must comply with any interim disinfection requirements the  State deems necessary before filtration is installed. A system that uses  a surface water source that provides filtration treatment must provide  the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (b) of this section  beginning June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed,  whichever is later. A system that uses a ground water source under the  direct influence of surface water and provides filtration treatment must  provide disinfection treatment as specified in paragraph (b) of this  section by June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed,  whichever is later. Failure to meet any requirement of this section  after the applicable date specified in this introductory paragraph is a  treatment technique violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disinfection requirements for public water systems that do not  provide filtration. Each public water system that does not provide  filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering  the distribution system, measured as specified in Sec.  141.74 (a)(2)  and (b)(5), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution  system, measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine  dioxide, as specified in Sec.  141.74 (a)(2) and (b)(6), cannot be  undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any  two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public. Water  in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria concentration  less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count  (HPC) as specified in Sec.  141.74(a)(1), is deemed to have a detectable  disinfectant residual for purposes of determining compliance with this  requirement. Thus, the value ``V'' in the following formula cannot  exceed 5 percent in one month, for any two consecutive months.
