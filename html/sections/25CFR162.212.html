Sec. 162.109 and 162.203 of this  part, along with certain standard terms and conditions to be included in  the lease. Advertisements will prohibit tenant preferences, and bidders  at lease sales will not be afforded any preference, unless a preference  in favor of individual Indians is required by a superseding tribal law  or leasing policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advertisements will require sealed bids, and they may also  provide for further competitive bidding among the prospective tenants at  the conclusion of the bid opening. Competitive bidding should be  supported, at a minimum, by a market study or rent survey that is  consistent with USPAP.</p>
