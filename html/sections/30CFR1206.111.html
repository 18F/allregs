                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section applies if you or your affiliate do not have an  arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or  your affiliate provide your own transportation services. Calculate your  transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable,  actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the  procedures prescribed in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Your or your affiliate's actual costs include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e)  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i)  of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Once the transportation system has been depreciated below ten  percent of total capital investment, a return on ten percent of total  capital investment under paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (d)  through (j) of this section, you may also deduct the following actual  costs. You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or  part of any other cost that you use under this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Volumetric adjustments for actual (not theoretical) line losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil  that the pipeline operator requires you as a shipper to maintain, and  that you do maintain, in the line as line fill. You must calculate this  cost as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain,  and that you do maintain, in the pipeline by the value of that volume  for the current month calculated under Sec. 1206.102 or Sec. 1206.103,  as applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A) of  this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the  rate of return specified in Sec. 1206.111(i)(2) by 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fees paid to a non-affiliated terminal operator for loading  and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or  other conveyance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical  movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at  the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity  petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower- gravity crude oil for transportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Fees paid to a non-affiliated quality bank administrator for  administration of a quality bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> You may not deduct any costs that are not actual costs of  transporting oil, including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with  terminalling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Title and terminal transfer fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a  market center or to avoid paying title transfer fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fees paid to brokers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Fees paid to a scheduling service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/ space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to  schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Theoretical line losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Gauging fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable  fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital  equipment) which are   an integral part of the transportation system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allowable operating expenses include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operations supervision and engineering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Operations labor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fuel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Utilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ad valorem property taxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Rent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Supplies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense  which you can document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allowable maintenance expenses include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance of the transportation system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maintenance of equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maintenance labor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses  which you can document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation  and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense.  State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees,  including royalties, are not allowable expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight- line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life  of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a unit-of- production method. After you make an election, you may not change  methods without ONRR approval. You may not depreciate equipment below a  reasonable salvage value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> This paragraph describes the basis for your depreciation  schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you or your affiliate own a transportation system on June 1,  2000, you must base your depreciation schedule used in calculating  actual transportation costs for production after June 1, 2000, on your  total capital investment in the system (including your original purchase  price or construction cost and subsequent reinvestment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you or your affiliate purchased the transportation system at  arm's length before June 1, 2000, you must incorporate depreciation on  the schedule based on your purchase price (and subsequent reinvestment)  into your transportation allowance calculations for production after  June 1, 2000, beginning at the point on the depreciation schedule  corresponding to that date. You must prorate your depreciation for  calendar year 2000 by claiming part-year depreciation for the period  from June 1, 2000 until December 31, 2000. You may not adjust your  transportation costs for production before June 1, 2000, using the  depreciation schedule based on your purchase price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you are the original owner of the transportation system on  June 1, 2000, or if you purchased your transportation system before  March 1, 1988, you must continue to use your existing depreciation  schedule in calculating actual transportation costs for production in  periods after June 1, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If you or your affiliate purchase a transportation system at  arm's length from the original owner after June 1, 2000, you must base  your depreciation schedule used in calculating actual transportation  costs on your total capital investment in the system (including your  original purchase price and subsequent reinvestment). You must prorate  your depreciation for the year in which you or your affiliate purchased  the system to reflect the portion of that year for which you or your  affiliate own the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If you or your affiliate purchase a transportation system at  arm's length after June 1, 2000, from anyone other than the original  owner, you must assume the depreciation schedule of the person from whom  you bought the system. Include in the depreciation schedule any  subsequent reinvestment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment,  multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning  of the period for which you are calculating the transportation allowance  by the rate of return provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rate of return is 1.3 times the industrial bond yield index  for Standard & Poor's BBB bond rating. Use the monthly average rate  published in ``Standard & Poor's Bond Guide'' for the first month of the  reporting period for which the allowance applies. Calculate the rate at  the beginning of each   subsequent transportation allowance reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After a transportation system has been depreciated at or  below a value equal to ten percent of your total capital investment, you  may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to ten  percent of your total capital investment in the transportation system  multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may apply this paragraph to a transportation system that  before June 1, 2000, was depreciated at or below a value equal to ten  percent of your total capital investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your  or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each  individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is  transported, allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the  liquid products transported. Your allocation must use the same  proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding  waste products with no value) to the volume of all liquid products  (excluding waste products with no value).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production  that is not royalty-bearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of  the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method if  it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where you transport both gaseous and liquid products through  the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation  procedure to ONRR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a  transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost  allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your  Form ONRR-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay  any additional royalty and interest due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You must submit your initial proposal, including all available  data, within 3 months after first claiming the allocated deductions on  Form ONRR-2014.
