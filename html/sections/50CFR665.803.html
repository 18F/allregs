                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The permit holder, or designated agent, for any vessel registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit, or for any vessel greater than 40 ft (12.2 m) LOA that is registered for use under an American Samoa longline limited access permit, shall provide a notice to the Regional Administrator at least 72 hours (not including weekends and Federal holidays) before the vessel leaves port on a fishing trip, any part of which occurs in the EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago or American Samoa. The vessel operator will be presumed to be an agent designated by the permit holder unless the Regional Administrator is otherwise notified by the permit holder. The permit holder or designated agent for a vessel registered for use under Hawaii longline limited access permits must also provide notification of the trip type (either deep-setting or shallow-setting).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The permit holder, or designated agent, for any vessel registered for use under a Western Pacific squid jig fishing permit that is greater than 50 ft (15.4 m) LOA, shall provide a notice to the Regional Administrator at least 72 hours (not including weekends and Federal holidays) before the vessel leaves port on a fishing trip, any part of which occurs in western Pacific EEZ waters. The vessel operator will be presumed to be an agent designated by the permit holder unless the Regional Administrator is otherwise notified by the permit holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, the notice must be provided to the office or telephone number designated by the Regional Administrator. The notice must provide the official number of the vessel, the name of the vessel, the intended departure date, time, and location, the name of the operator of the vessel, and the name and telephone number of the permit holder or designated agent to be available between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (local time) on weekdays for NMFS to contact to arrange observer placement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The operator of any vessel subject to the requirements of this subpart who does not have on board a VMS unit while transiting the protected species zone as defined in Sec. 665.806, must notify the NMFS Special-Agent-In-Charge immediately upon entering and immediately upon departing the protected species zone. The notification must include the name of the vessel, name of the operator, date and time (GMT) of access or exit from the protected species zone, and location by latitude and longitude to the nearest minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The permit holder for any American Samoa longline limited access permit, or an agent designated by the permit holder, must notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 30 days of any change to the permit holder's contact information or any change to the vessel documentation associated with a permit registered to an American Samoa longline limited access permit. Complete changes in the ownership of the vessel registered to an American Samoa longline limited access permit must also be reported to PIRO in writing within 30 days of the change. Failure to report such changes may result in a delay in processing an application, permit holders failing to receive important notifications, or sanctions pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(g) or 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.</p>
