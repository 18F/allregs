No such plant pests; means  of conveyance or their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products;  soil; stone or quarry products under Sec. 330.300; garbage; or other  products or articles which an inspector notifies the Customs authorities  should be held for inspection shall be released by Customs officers for  entry or onward movement until released by an inspector.

Whenever it shall be deemed safe to modify the requirements of this  section by exempting any class of means of conveyance, products or  articles from the requirement that they be held for inspection and  release   of the inspector, the exemptions shall be specified in administrative  instructions. Inspectors shall make local arrangements, in accordance  with policies of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, with the  Collector of Customs for the release by Customs officers on behalf of  the inspector of any class of means of conveyance, their stores,  baggage, mail, or other products or articles when such arrangements do  not increase unduly the danger of plant pest dissemination and will  facilitate clearance of means of conveyance, baggage, mail, or other  products or articles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection of domestic movements. For the purpose of preventing  the interstate movement of plant pests, provisions requiring inspection  of means of conveyance and products or articles moving interstate may be  issued as regulations in association with quarantines in part 301 or  part 318 of this chapter or in this part.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Notices appearing at 24 FR 4650, June 9, 1959, 24 FR 5363,  July 2, 1959, 24 FR 6889, August 26, 1959, and 24 FR 7519, September 18,  1959, provide in part as follows: That means of conveyance subject to  such inspection and release requirements and arriving at any port of  entry outside the regularly assigned hours of duty of the Federal plant  quarantine inspector, will be held for such inspection and release,  until the regularly assigned hours of duty. However, notice is also  hereby given that pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 28,  1950 (7 U.S.C. 2260) such inspection service outside of the regularly  assigned hours of duty may be made available to any interested person,  upon a reimbursable basis and in accordance with applicable regulations,  upon request to the Plant Quarantine Inspector in Charge at such port.</p><p class="depth2">Information concerning regularly assigned hours of duty for Federal  plant quarantine inspectors at each port where such inspection is  available may be obtained locally by application to the Plant Quarantine  Inspector in Charge at such port.
