                            <p class="depth0">The entities identified in Sec. 34.302 are eligible to apply for their allocation as a grant. Treasury will develop an application process for grants available under this subpart that is consistent with the Act and Federal policies on grants. At a minimum, the procedure will include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before an eligible entity may receive a Direct Component activity grant, the grant applicant must submit a Multiyear Implementation Plan describing each activity for which it seeks funding under the Direct Component. Applications to fund preparation

and amendment of the Multiyear Implementation Plan are exempt from this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each activity, the plan must include a narrative description demonstrating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need for, purpose, and objectives of the activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How the activity is eligible for funding and meets all requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Budget;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Milestones;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Projected completion dates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Criteria the applicant will use to evaluate the success of each activity in helping to restore and protect the Gulf Coast Region impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The plan was made available for public review and comment for a minimum of 45 days in a manner calculated to obtain broad-based participation from individuals, businesses, Indian tribes, and non-profit organizations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Each activity in the plan was adopted after consideration of meaningful input from the public. Treasury may require a standard format and additional information in the plans. Plans can be phased and incremental and may be modified later by the applicant, subject to the same submittal requirements. If the applicant has requested or anticipates requesting funding for any part of the activity from other sources, including other components in the Act, the applicant must identify the source, state the amount of funding, and provide the current status of the request. For the State of Louisiana parishes, the applicant must submit information demonstrating compliance with Sec. 34.302(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The applicant must include supporting information in each grant application that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed activities meet the statutory requirements for eligibility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each activity designed to protect or restore natural resources is based on best available science.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An applicant may satisfy some or all of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 34.303 and 34.802(a) through (e) if it can demonstrate in its application to Treasury that before July 6, 2012:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant established conditions to carry out activities that are substantively the same as the requirements in Sec. 34.303 and 34.802(a) through (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicable activity qualified as one or more of the eligible activities in Sec. 34.201.</p>
