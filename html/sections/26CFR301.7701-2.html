                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Business entities. For purposes of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, a business entity is any entity recognized for federal tax purposes (including an entity with a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3) that is not properly classified as a trust under Sec. 301.7701-4 or otherwise subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. A business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax purposes as either a corporation or a partnership. A business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is disregarded; if the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner. But see paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section for special employment and excise tax rules that apply to an eligible entity that is otherwise disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Corporations. For federal tax purposes, the term corporation means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A business entity organized under a Federal or State statute, or under a statute of a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as incorporated or as a corporation, body corporate, or body politic;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An association (as determined under Sec. 301.7701-3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A business entity organized under a State statute, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as a joint-stock company or joint-stock association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An insurance company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A State-chartered business entity conducting banking activities, if any of its deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq., or a similar federal statute;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political subdivision thereof, or a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government or any other entity described in Sec. 1.892-2T;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A business entity that is taxable as a corporation under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 7701(a)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain foreign entities--(i) In general.

The following entities will not be treated as corporations under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With regard to Canada, a Nova Scotia Unlimited Liability Company (or any other company or corporation all of whose owners have unlimited liability pursuant to federal or provincial law).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With regard to India, a company deemed to be a public limited company solely by operation of section 43A(1) (relating to corporate ownership of the company), section 43A(1A) (relating to annual average turnover), or section 43A(1B) (relating to ownership interests in other companies) of the Companies Act, 1956 (or any combination of these), provided that the organizational documents of such deemed public limited company continue to meet the requirements of section 3(1)(iii) of the Companies Act, 1956.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With regard to Malaysia, a Sendirian Berhad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Inclusions in certain cases. With regard to Mexico, the term Sociedad Anonima includes a Sociedad Anonima that chooses to apply the variable capital provision of Mexican corporate law (Sociedad Anonima de Capital Variable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Public companies. For purposes of paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, with regard to Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Jamaica, the term Public Limited Company includes any Limited Company that is not defined as a private company under the corporate laws of those jurisdictions. In all other cases, where the term Public Limited Company is not defined, that term shall include any Limited Company defined as a public company under the corporate laws of the relevant jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limited companies. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(8), any reference to a Limited Company includes, as the case may be, companies limited by shares and companies limited by guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Multilingual countries. Different linguistic renderings of the name of an entity listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section shall be disregarded. For example, an entity formed under the laws of Switzerland as a Societe Anonyme will be a corporation and treated in the same manner as an Aktiengesellschaft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(9)</em> Business entities with multiple charters. (i) An entity created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction if the rules of this section would treat it as a corporation with reference to any one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Such an entity may elect its classification under Sec. 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions, only if it is created or organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a). The determination of a business entity's corporate or non-corporate classification is made independently from the determination of whether the entity is domestic or foreign. See Sec. 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Business entities with multiple charters. (i) An entity created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction if the rules of this section would treat it as a corporation with reference to any one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Such an entity may elect its classification under Sec. 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions, only if it is created or organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a). The determination of a business entity's corporate or non-corporate classification is made independently from the determination of whether the entity is domestic or foreign. See Sec. 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An entity created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction if the rules of this section would treat it as a corporation with reference to any one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Such an entity may elect its classification under Sec. 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions, only if it is created or organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a). The determination of a business entity's corporate or non-corporate classification is made independently from the determination of whether the entity is domestic or foreign. See Sec. 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (b)(9):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X is an entity with a single owner organized under the laws of Country A as an entity that is listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. Under the rules of this section, such an entity is a corporation for Federal tax purposes and under Sec. 301.7701-3(a) is unable to elect its classification. Several years after its formation, X files a certificate of domestication in State B as a limited liability company (LLC). Under the laws of State B, X is considered to be created or organized in State B as an LLC upon the filing of the certificate of domestication and is therefore subject to the laws of State B. Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, an LLC with a single owner organized only in State B is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). Neither Country A nor State B law requires X to terminate its charter in Country A as a result of the domestication, and in fact X does not terminate its Country A charter. Consequently, X is now organized in more than one jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. X remains organized under the laws of Country A as an entity that is listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, and as such, it is an entity that is treated as a corporation under the rules of this section. Therefore, X is a corporation for Federal tax purposes because the rules of this section would treat X as a corporation with reference to one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Because X is organized in Country A in a manner that does not meet the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a), it is unable to elect its classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Y is an entity that is incorporated under the laws of State A and

has two shareholders. Under the rules of this section, an entity incorporated under the laws of State A is a corporation for Federal tax purposes and under Sec. 301.7701-3(a) is unable to elect its classification. Several years after its formation, Y files a certificate of continuance in Country B as an unlimited company. Under the laws of Country B, upon filing a certificate of continuance, Y is treated as organized in Country B. Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, an unlimited company organized only in Country B that has more than one owner is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). Neither State A nor Country B law requires Y to terminate its charter in State A as a result of the continuance, and in fact Y does not terminate its State A charter. Consequently, Y is now organized in more than one jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Y remains organized in State A as a corporation, an entity that is treated as a corporation under the rules of this section. Therefore, Y is a corporation for Federal tax purposes because the rules of this section would treat Y as a corporation with reference to one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Because Y is organized in State A in a manner that does not meet the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a), it is unable to elect its classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Z is an entity that has more than one owner and that is recognized under the laws of Country A as an unlimited company organized in Country A. Z is organized in Country A in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a). Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, an unlimited company organized only in Country A with more than one owner is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). At the time Z was formed, it was also organized as a private limited company under the laws of Country B. Z is organized in Country B in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a). Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, a private limited company organized only in Country B is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as a partnership). Thus, Z is organized in more than one jurisdiction. Z has not made any entity classification elections under Sec. 301.7701-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Z is organized in Country B as a private limited company, an entity that is treated (absent an election to the contrary) as a corporation under the rules of this section. However, because Z is organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in Sec. 301.7701-3(a), it may elect its classification under Sec. 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P is an entity with more than one owner organized in Country A as a general partnership. Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, an eligible entity with more than one owner in Country A is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). P files a certificate of continuance in Country B as an unlimited company. Under the rules of this section and Sec. 301.7701-3, an unlimited company in Country B with more than one owner is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). P is not required under either the laws of Country A or Country B to terminate the general partnership in Country A, and in fact P does not terminate its Country A partnership. P is now organized in more than one jurisdiction. P has not made any entity classification elections under Sec. 301.7701-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. P's organization in both Country A and Country B would result in P being classified as a partnership. Therefore, since the rules of this section would not treat P as a corporation with reference to any jurisdiction in which it is created or organized, it is not a corporation for federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other business entities. For federal tax purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term partnership means a business entity that is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section and that has at least two members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wholly owned entities--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain business entities. If the single owner of a business entity is a bank (as defined in section 581, or, in the case of a foreign bank, as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) without regard to the second sentence thereof), then the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code will continue to apply to the single owner as if the wholly owned entity were a separate entity. For this purpose, the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code do not include the rules under sections 864(c), 882(c), and 884.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax liabilities of certain disregarded entities--(A) In general. An entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for any purpose under

this section is treated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal tax liabilities of the entity with respect to any taxable period for which the entity was not disregarded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the entity is liable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Refunds or credits of Federal tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 2006, X, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, merges into Z, a domestic LLC wholly owned by Y that is disregarded as an entity separate from Y, in a state law merger. X was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2005. Under the applicable state law, Z is the successor to X and is liable for all of X's debts. In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for X's 2005 taxable year. Because Z is the successor to X and is liable for X's 2005 taxes that remain unpaid, Z is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 2007, the IRS determines that X miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability for 2005. Because Z is the successor to X and is liable for X's 2005 taxes that remain unpaid, the deficiency may be assessed against Z and, in the event that Z fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, a general tax lien will arise against all of Z's property and rights to property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for employment tax purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply to taxes imposed under Subtitle C--Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment of entity. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to taxes imposed under Subtitle C--Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code). For special rules regarding the application of certain employment tax exceptions, see Sec. Sec. 31.3121(b)(3)-1(d), 31.3127-1(b), and 31.3306(c)(5)-1(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rules. (1) Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply to withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding). Thus, in the case of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section, the owner is subject to the withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to taxes imposed under Subtitle A, including Chapter 2--Tax on Self Employment Income. Thus, the owner of an entity that is treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship under paragraph (a) of this section is subject to tax on self-employment income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> LLCA is an eligible entity owned by individual A and is generally disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal tax purposes. However, LLCA is treated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. LLCA has employees and pays wages as defined in sections 3121(a), 3306(b), and 3401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> LLCA is subject to the provisions of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code and related provisions under 26 CFR subchapter C, Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax at Source, parts 31 through 39. Accordingly, LLCA is required to perform such acts as are required of an employer under those provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder that apply. All provisions of law (including penalties) and the regulations prescribed in pursuance of law applicable to employers in respect of such acts are applicable to LLCA. Thus, for example, LLCA is liable for income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes. See sections 3402 and 3403 (relating to income tax withholding); 3102(b) and 3111 (relating to FICA taxes), and 3301 (relating to FUTA taxes). In addition, LLCA must file under its name and EIN the applicable Forms in the 94X series, for example, Form 941, ``Employer's Quarterly Employment Tax Return,'' Form 940, ``Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return;'' file with the Social Security

Administration and furnish to LLCA's employees statements on Forms W-2, ``Wage and Tax Statement;'' and make timely employment tax deposits. See Sec. Sec. 31.6011(a)-1, 31.6011(a)-3, 31.6051-1, 31.6051-2, and 31.6302-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A is self-employed for purposes of subtitle A, chapter 2, Tax on Self-Employment Income, of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, A is subject to tax under section 1401 on A's net earnings from self-employment with respect to LLCA's activities. A is not an employee of LLCA for purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. Because LLCA is treated as a sole proprietorship of A for income tax purposes, A is entitled to deduct trade or business expenses paid or incurred with respect to activities carried on through LLCA, including the employer's share of employment taxes imposed under sections 3111 and 3301, on A's Form 1040, Schedule C, ``Profit or Loss for Business (Sole Proprietorship).''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for certain excise tax purposes--(A) In general. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply for purposes of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal tax liabilities imposed by Chapters 31, 32 (other than section 4181), 33, 34, 35, 36 (other than section 4461), 38, and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any floor stocks tax imposed on articles subject to any of these taxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Collection of tax imposed by Chapters 33 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Registration under sections 4101, 4222, 4412;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Claims of a credit (other than a credit under section 34), refund, or payment related to a tax described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1) of this section or under section 6426 or 6427; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assessment and collection of an assessable payment imposed by section 4980H and reporting required by section 6056.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment of entity. An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to items described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> LLCB is an eligible entity that has a single owner, B. LLCB is generally disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. However, under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, LLCB is treated as an entity separate from its owner for certain purposes relating to excise taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> LLCB mines coal from a coal mine located in the United States. Section 4121 of chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the producer's sale of such coal. Section 48.4121-1(a) of this chapter defines a ``producer'' generally as the person in whom is vested ownership of the coal under state law immediately after the coal is severed from the ground. LLCB is the person that owns the coal under state law immediately after it is severed from the ground. Under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1) of this section, LLCB is the producer of the coal and is liable for tax on its sale of such coal under chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. LLCB must report and pay tax on Form 720, ``Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,'' under its own name and taxpayer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> LLCB uses undyed diesel fuel in an earthmover that is not registered or required to be registered for highway use. Such use is an off-highway business use of the fuel.
