                            <p class="depth0">In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, the time limits prescribed in Sec. Sec. 5.52 and 5.55 may be extended by an official named in Sec. 5.54(a) who will provide written notice to the requestor setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected. Such notice will specify no date that would result in an extension of more than ten work days. In unusual circumstances, the Headquarters FOIA Officer may authorize more than one extension, divided between the initial request stage and the appeals stage, but in no event will the combined periods of extension exceed ten work days. As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' include only those circumstances where extension of time is reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request. Examples include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency or with a non-Federal source having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of FEMA having substantial subject matter interest therein.</p>
