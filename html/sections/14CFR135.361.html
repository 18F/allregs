In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides  with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the  obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and  proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point.  After that the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the  ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument  approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of  these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns  of at least 4,000-foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the  obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends  laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the  obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this  width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet  on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the  intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; after  that it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.</p>
