It is the difference between the value of the shares of the applicable investment fund(s) that would have been purchased had the contribution been made on the ``as of'' date and the value of the shares of the same investment fund(s) on the date the contribution is posted to the account.</p><p class="depth2">Error means any act or omission by the Board, the TSP Record Keeper, or the participant's employing agency that is not in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, or administrative procedures that are made available to employing agencies and/or TSP participants.
