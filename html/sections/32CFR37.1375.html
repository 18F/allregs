Sec. Appendix D to Part 37--What Common National Policy Requirements May</p><p class="depth0">Apply and Need To Be Included in TIAs?</p><p class="depth0">Whether your TIA is a cooperative agreement or another type of assistance transaction, as discussed in Appendix B to this part, the terms and conditions of the agreement must provide for recipients' compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations. This appendix lists some of the more common requirements to aid you in identifying ones that apply to your TIA. The list is not intended to be all-inclusive, however, and you may need to consult legal

counsel to verify whether there are others that apply in your situation (e.g., due to a provision in the appropriations act for the specific funds that you are using or due to a statute or rule that applies to a particular program or type of activity).</p><p class="depth0">A. Certifications</p><p class="depth0">One requirement that applies to all TIAs currently requires you to obtain a certification at the time of proposal. That requirement is in a Governmentwide common rule about lobbying prohibitions, which is implemented by the DoD at 32 CFR part 28. The prohibitions apply to all financial assistance. Appendix A to 32 CFR part 22 includes a sample provision that you may use, to have proposers incorporate the certification by reference into their proposals.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assurances That Apply to All TIAs</p><p class="depth0">DoD policy is to use a certification, as described in the preceding paragraph, only for a national policy requirement that specifically requires one. The usual approach to communicating other national policy requirements to recipients is to incorporate them as award terms or conditions, or assurances. Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22 lists national policy requirements that commonly apply to grants and cooperative agreements. It also has suggested language for assurances to incorporate the requirements in award documents. Of those requirements, the following six apply to all TIAs:</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements concerning debarment and suspension in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by the DoD at 2 CFR part 1125. The requirements apply to all nonprocurement transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Requirements concerning drug-free workplace in the Governmentwide common rule that the DoD has codified at 32 CFR part 26. The requirements apply to all financial assistance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d, et seq.). These apply to all financial assistance. They require recipients to flow down the prohibitions to any subrecipients performing a part of the substantive research program (as opposed to suppliers from whom recipients purchase goods or services). For further information, see item a. under the heading ``Nondiscrimination'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of age, in the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101, et seq.). They apply to all financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients. For further information, see item d. under the heading ``Nondiscrimination'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.</p><p class="depth0">5. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of handicap, in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). They apply to all financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients. For further information, see item e.1. under the heading ``Nondiscrimination'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.</p><p class="depth0">6. Preferences for use of U.S.-flag air carriers in the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 40118), which apply to uses of U.S. Government funds.</p><p class="depth0">C. Other Assurances</p><p class="depth0">Additional requirements listed in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22 may apply in certain circumstances, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. If construction work is to be done under a TIA or its subawards, it is subject to the prohibitions in Executive Order 11246 on discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For further information, see item b. under the heading ``Nondiscrimination'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.</p><p class="depth0">2. If the research involves human subjects or animals, it is subject to the requirements in item a. or b., respectively, under the heading ``Live organisms'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.</p><p class="depth0">3. If the research involves actions that may affect the environment, it is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, which is item b.1. under the heading ``Environmental Standards'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22. It also may be subject to one or more of the other requirements in items b.2. through b.6. under that heading, which concern flood-prone areas, coastal zones, coastal barriers, wild and scenic rivers, and underground sources of drinking water.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the project may impact a historic property, it is subject to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), as described under the heading ``National Historic Preservation'' in Appendix B to 32 CFR part 22.
[68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 49477, Aug. 23, 2005; 72 FR 34999, June 26, 2007]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix E to Part 37--What Provisions May a Participant Need To</p><p class="depth0">Include When Purchasing Goods or Services Under a TIA?</p><p class="depth0">A. As discussed in Sec. 37.705, you must inform recipients of any national policy requirements that flow down to their purchases of goods or services (e.g., supplies or equipment) under their TIAs. Note that purchases of goods or services differ from subawards, which are for substantive research program performance.</p><p class="depth0">B. Appendix A to 32 CFR part 34 lists seven national policy requirements that commonly apply to firms' purchases under grants or cooperative agreements. Of those seven, two that apply to all recipients' purchases under TIAs are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352). A contractor submitting a bid to the recipient for a contract award of $100,000 or more must file a certification with the recipient that it has not and will not use Federal appropriations for certain lobbying purposes. The contractor also must disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. For further details, see 32 CFR part 28, the DoD's codification of the Governmentwide common rule implementing this amendment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debarment and suspension. A contract award with an amount expected to equal or exceed $25,000 and certain other contract awards (see 2 CFR 1125.220, which implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 180.220) shall not be made to parties listed on the Governmentwide Excluded Parties List System, in accordance with the DoD adoption at 2 CFR part 1125 of the OMB guidance implementing E.O.s 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235), ``Debarment and Suspension.'' The Excluded Parties List System accessible on the Internet at www.epls.gov contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than E.O. 12549.</p><p class="depth0">C. One other requirement applies only in cases where construction work is to be performed under the TIA with Federal funds or recipient funds counted toward required cost sharing:</p><p class="depth0">1. Equal Employment Opportunity. Although construction work should happen rarely under a TIA, the agreements officer in that case should inform the recipient that Department of Labor regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) prescribe a clause that must be incorporated into construction awards and subawards. Further details are provided in Appendix B to Part 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 22), in section b. under the heading ``Nondiscrimination.''
