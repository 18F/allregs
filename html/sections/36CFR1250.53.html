                                Sec. 1250.53  What is the FOIA fee schedule for operational records?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In responding to FOIA requests for operational records, NARA charges  the following fees, where applicable, unless we have given you a  reduction or waiver of fees under Sec. 1250.56.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Search fees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual searching. When the search is relatively  straightforward and can be performed by a clerical or administrative  employee, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When  the request is more complicated and must be done by a NARA professional  employee, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computer searching. NARA bases the fees for computer searches on  the actual cost to NARA of operating the computer and the salary of the  operator. When the search is relatively straightforward and a clerical  or administrative employee can conduct it, the search rate is $16 per  hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a  NARA professional employee must perform it, the rate is $33 per hour (or  fraction thereof).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NARA charges review fees for time we spend  examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine  whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. NARA  charges review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a  record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The review fee is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NARA does not charge review fees for time we spend resolving  general   legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However,  NARA does charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering  any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial  information submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reproduction fees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Self-service photocopying. At NARA  facilities with self-service photocopiers, you may make reproductions of  released paper records for $0.25 per page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Photocopying standard-sized pages. When we make the photocopies  for operational records, the charge is $0.30 per page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reproductions of electronic records. NARA charges you for our  direct costs for staff time for programming, computer operations, and  printouts or electromagnetic media to reproduce the requested electronic  information. When the work is relatively straightforward and a clerical  or administrative employee can perform it, the rate is $16 per hour (or  fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA  professional employee must do it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction  thereof).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copying other media. This is the direct cost to NARA of the  reproduction. We provide specific rates on a case-by-case basis.</p>
