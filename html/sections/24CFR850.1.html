This part implements the Housing Development Grant Program contained in section 17 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437o). The Program authorized the Secretary to make housing development grants to support the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of real property to be used primarily for residential rental purposes. Section 289(b)(1) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12839) repealed section 17 effective October 1, 1991. Section 289(a) prohibited new grants under the Housing Development Grant Program except for projects for which binding commitments had been entered into prior to October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Savings clause. Any grant made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into before October 1, 1991 will continue to be governed by subparts A

through E of this part in effect immediately before April 1, 1996, and by subpart F of this part as currently in effect.
