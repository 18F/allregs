                                Sec. 261.420  Contingency planning and emergency procedures for secondary material.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A generator or an intermediate or reclamation facility operating  under a verified recycler variance under Sec. 260.31(d) that generates  or accumulates more than 6000 kg of hazardous secondary material must  comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and implementation of contingency plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each  generator or an intermediate or reclamation facility operating under a  verified recycler variance under Sec. 260.31(d) that accumulates more  than 6000 kg of hazardous secondary material must have a contingency  plan for his facility. The contingency plan must be designed to minimize  hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or  any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous secondary  material or hazardous secondary material constituents to air, soil, or  surface water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately  whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous secondary  material or hazardous secondary material constituents which could  threaten human health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of contingency plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contingency plan must  describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with  paragraphs (a) and (f) in response to fires, explosions, or any  unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous secondary material  or hazardous secondary material constituents to air, soil, or surface  water at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the generator or an intermediate or reclamation facility  operating under a verified recycler variance under Sec. 260.31(d)  accumulating more than 6000 kg of hazardous secondary material has  already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC)  Plan in accordance with part 112 of this chapter, or some other  emergency or contingency plan, he need only amend that plan to  incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to  comply with the requirements of this part. The hazardous secondary  material generator or an intermediate or reclamation facility operating  under a verified recycler variance under Sec. 260.31(d) may develop one  contingency plan which meets all regulatory requirements. EPA recommends  that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated  Contingency Plan Guidance (``One Plan''). When modifications are made to  non-RCRA provisions in an integrated contingency plan, the changes do  not trigger the need for a RCRA permit modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan must describe arrangements agreed to by local police  departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and  local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services,  pursuant to Sec. 262.410(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The plan must list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office  and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see  paragraph (e) of this section), and this list must   be kept up-to-date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be  named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the  order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the  facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment,  communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and  decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list  must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location  and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline  of its capabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The plan must include an evacuation plan for facility personnel  where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This  plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation  routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary  routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Copies of contingency plan. A copy of the contingency plan and  all revisions to the plan must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintained at the facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitted to all local police departments, fire departments,  hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be  called upon to provide emergency services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be  reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicable regulations are revised;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plan fails in an emergency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The facility changes--in its design, construction, operation,  maintenance, or other circumstances--in a way that materially increases  the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous secondary  material or hazardous secondary material constituents, or changes the  response necessary in an emergency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The list of emergency coordinators changes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The list of emergency equipment changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one  employee either on the facility premises or on call (i.e., available to  respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period  of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response  measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with  all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and  activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste  handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the  facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to  commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan. The  emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more fully spelled out in  paragraph (f). Applicable responsibilities for the emergency coordinator  vary, depending on factors such as type and variety of hazardous  secondary material(s) handled by the facility, and type and complexity  of the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emergency procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever there is an imminent or  actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee  when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems,  where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated  response roles if their help is needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency  coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source,  amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by  observation or review of facility records or manifests and, if  necessary, by chemical analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible  hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the  release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct  and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the  effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are  generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from  water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced  explosions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has  had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or  the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may  be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities.  He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local  areas should be evacuated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> He must immediately notify either the government official  designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or  the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/ 424-8802). The report must include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Name and telephone number of reporter;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Name and address of facility;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The extent of injuries, if any; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The possible hazards to human health, or the environment,  outside the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all  reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and  releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous secondary  material at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable,  stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released  material, and removing or isolating containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the facility stops operations in response to a fire,  explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks,  pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other  equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must  provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered secondary  material, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that  results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility. Unless the  hazardous secondary material generator can demonstrate, in accordance  with Sec. 261.3(c) or (d) of this chapter, that the recovered material  is not a hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of  hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable  requirements of parts 262, 263, and 265 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected  area(s) of the facility:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No secondary material that may be incompatible with the released  material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are  completed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is  cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The hazardous secondary material generator must note in the  operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that  requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the  incident, he must submit a written report on the incident to the  Regional Administrator. The report must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the hazardous secondary  material generator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The extent of injuries, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or  the environment, where this is applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that  resulted from the incident.
