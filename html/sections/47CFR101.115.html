Sec. 101.147(b)(1) through (b)(4), where omnidirectional antennas may be used. \3\ Antennas used at outlying stations as part of a central protection alarm system need conform to only the following 2 standards: (i) The minimum on-beam forward gain must be at least 10 dBi, and (ii) The minimum front-to-back ratio must be at least 20 dB. \4\ Omnidirectional antennas may be authorized in the band 2150-2160 MHz. \5\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized after June 1, 1997. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that date</p><p class="depth3">are grandfathered and need not comply with these standards. \6\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized on or before June 1, 1997. \7\ Except for antennas between 140 and 180 authorized or pending on January 1, 1989, in the band 10,550 to 10,565 MHz for which minimum radiation</p><p class="depth3">suppression to angle (in degrees) from centerline of main beam is 36 decibels. \8\ These antenna standards apply only to DEMS User Stations licensed, in operation, or applied for prior to July 15, 1993. \9\ Except for Temporary-fixed operations in the band 13200-13250 MHz with output powers less than 250 mW and as provided in Sec. 101.147(q), and</p><p class="depth3">except for antennas in the MVDDS service in the band 12.2-12.7 GHz. \10\ DEMS User Station antennas in this band must meet performance Standard B and have a minimum antenna gain of 34 dBi. The maximum beamwidth</p><p class="depth3">requirement does not apply to DEMS User Stations. DEMS Nodal Stations need not comply with these standards. Stations authorized to operate in the</p><p class="depth3">24,250-25,250 MHz band do not have to meet these standards, however, the Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where</p><p class="depth3">interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas. \11\ Except as provided in Sec. 101.147(s). \12\ The minimum front-to-back ratio shall be 38 dBi. \13\ Mobile, except aeronautical mobile, stations need not comply with these standards. \14\ Stations authorized to operate in the 38,600-40,000 MHz band may use antennas other than those meeting the Category A standard. However, the</p><p class="depth3">Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas. \15\ Antenna gain less than 50 dBi (but greater than or equal to 43 dBi) is permitted only with a proportional reduction in maximum authorized EIRP in a</p><p class="depth3">ratio of 2 dB of power per 1 dB of gain, so that the maximum allowable EIRP (in dBW) for antennas of less than 50 dBi gain becomes + 55-2(50-G), where</p><p class="depth3">G is the antenna gain in dBi. In addition, antennas in these bands must meet two additional standards for minimum radiation suppression: At angles</p><p class="depth3">between 1.2 and 5 degrees from the centerline of the main beam, co-polar discrimination must be G-28, where G is the antenna gain in dBi; and at</p><p class="depth3">angles of less than 5 degrees from the centerline of main beam, cross-polar discrimination must be at least 25 dB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this section for parallel  polarization. For cases of potential interference, an antenna will not  be considered to meet Standard A unless the parallel polarization  performance for the discrimination angle involved meets the  requirements, even if the cross-polarization performance controls the  interference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases where passive reflectors are employed in conjunction  with transmitting antenna systems, the foregoing paragraphs of this  section also will be applicable. However, in such instances, the center  of the major lobe of radiation from the antenna normally must be  directed at the passive reflector, and the center of the major lobe of  radiation from the passive reflector directed toward the receiving  station with which it communicates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Periscope antennas used at an electric power facility plant area  will be excluded from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section  on a case-by-case basis where technical considerations or safety  preclude the use of other types of antenna systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the 10,700-11,700 MHz band, a fixed station may employ  transmitting and receiving antennas meeting performance standard B in  any area. If a Fixed Service or Fixed Satellite Service licensee or  applicant makes a showing that it is likely to receive interference from  such fixed station and that such interference would not exist if the  fixed station used an antenna meeting performance standard A, the fixed  station licensee must modify its use. Specifically, the fixed station  licensee must either substitute an antenna meeting performance standard  A or operate its system with an EIRP reduced so as not to radiate, in  the direction of the other licensee, an EIRP in excess of that which  would be radiated by a station using a Category A antenna and operating  with the maximum EIRP allowed by the rules. A licensee or prior  applicant using an antenna that does not meet performance Standard A may  object to a prior coordination notice based on interference only if such  interference would be predicted to exist if the licensee or prior  applicant used an antenna meeting performance standard A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In the event harmful interference is caused to the operation of  other stations, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for  hearing, order changes to be made in the height, orientation, gain and  radiation pattern of the antenna system.
