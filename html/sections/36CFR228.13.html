In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, as directed by the Forest Service, and maintain therein, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the time of deposit of not less than the required dollar amount of the bond. A blanket bond covering nationwide or statewide operations may be furnished if the terms and conditions thereof are sufficient to comply with the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the amount of the bond, consideration will be given to the estimated cost of stabilizing, rehabilitating, and reclaiming the area of operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that an approved plan of operations is modified in accordance with Sec. 228.4 (d) and (e), the authorized officer will review the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, will adjust the bond to conform to the operations plan as modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When reclamation has been completed in accordance with Sec. 228.8(g), the authorized officer will notify the operator that performance under the bond has been completed: Provided, however, That when the Forest Service has accepted as completed any portion of the reclamation, the authorized officer shall notify the operator of such acceptance and reduce proportionally the amount of bond thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation.
