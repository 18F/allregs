                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The payment of legal processes from the TSP is governed solely  by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84,  and by the terms of this subpart. Although the TSP will honor legal  processes properly issued by a competent authority, those entities have  no jurisdiction over the TSP and the TSP cannot be made a party to the  underlying proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The TSP will review a legal process to determine whether it is  enforceable against the TSP only after the TSP has received a complete  copy of the document. Receipt by an employing agency or any other agency  of the Government does not constitute receipt by the TSP. Legal  processes should be submitted to the TSP record keeper at the current  address as provided at http://www.tsp.gov. Receipt by the TSP record  keeper is considered receipt by the TSP. To be complete, a legal process  must contain all pages and attachments; it must also provide (or be  accompanied by a document that provides):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participant's account number or Social Security number  (SSN);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and last known mailing address of each payee covered  under the order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The SSN and state of legal residence of the payee if he or she  if the current or former spouse of the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As soon as practicable after the TSP receives a document that  purports   to be a qualifying legal process, whether or not complete, the  participant's account will be frozen. After the account is frozen, no  withdrawal or loan disbursements will be allowed until the account is  unfrozen. All other account activity will be permitted, including  contributions, loan repayments, adjustments, contribution allocations  and interfund transfers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following documents will not be treated as purporting to be  a qualifying legal processes, and accounts of participants to whom such  orders relate will not be frozen:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A document that does not indicate on its face (or accompany a  document that establishes) that it has been issued by a competent  authority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A legal process relating to a TSP account that has been closed;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A legal process that does not relate either to the TSP or to the  participant's retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After the participant's account is frozen, the TSP will review  the document further to determine if it is complete; if the document is  not complete, the TSP will request a complete document. If a complete  copy is not received by the TSP within 30 days of that request, the  account will be unfrozen and no further action will be taken with  respect to the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The TSP decision letter is final. There is no administrative  appeal from the TSP decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An account frozen under this section will be unfrozen as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a complete document has not been received within 30 days of  the date of a request described in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the account was frozen pursuant to a legal process requiring  the TSP to freeze the participant's account in anticipation of an order  to pay from the account, the account will be unfrozen if any one of the  following events occurs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As soon as practicable after the TSP receives a complete copy of  an order vacating or superseding the preliminary order (unless the order  vacating or superseding the preliminary order qualifies to place a  freeze on the account);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon payment pursuant to the order to pay from the account, if  the TSP determines that the order is qualifying; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As soon as practicable after the TSP issues a decision letter  informing the parties that the order to pay from the account is not a  qualifying legal process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the account was frozen after the TSP received a document that  purports to be a legal process requiring payment from the participant's  account, the account will be unfrozen:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon payment pursuant to a qualifying legal process; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As soon as practicable after the TSP informs the parties that  the document is not a qualifying legal process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Multiple qualifying legal processes relating to the same TSP  account and received by the TSP will be processed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the legal processes make awards to the same payee or payees  and do not indicate that the awards are cumulative, the TSP will only  honor the legal process bearing the latest effective date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the legal processes relate to different payees, the legal  process will be honored:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the order of their receipt by the TSP, if received by the TSP  on different days; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the order of their effective dates, if received by the TSP  on the same day.
