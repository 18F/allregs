                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability; procedures for use. Subject to the provisions of  Sec.  1114.21(b)(2), a party may serve upon any other party a written  request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only,  of the truth of any matters within the scope of Sec.  1114.21 set forth  in the request, including the genuineness of any documents described in  the request for admission. Copies of documents should be served with the  request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made  available for inspection and copying. Each matter of which an admission  is requested should be separately set forth. The matter is admitted  unless, within a period designated in the request, not less than 15 days  after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves  upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection  addressed to the matter, signed by the party or his representative or  counsel. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated.  The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail  the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the  matter. A denial should fairly meet the substance of the requested  admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer  or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he  shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the  remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or  knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that  he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily  obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A  party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been  requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground  alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of Sec.   1114.31, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or  deny it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of admission. Any matter admitted under this rule is  conclusively established unless upon petition and a showing of good  cause the Board enters an order permitting withdrawal or amendment of  the admission. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the  purpose of the pending proceeding only and is not an admission by him  for any other purpose nor may it be used against him in any other  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service of written requests for admission in those proceedings  not requiring a petition. No requests for admission should be served  within 20 days prior to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or  the filing of opening statements of fact and argument under the modified  procedure, and when requests for admission are to be served in a foreign  country they should not be served within 40 days prior to such date.
