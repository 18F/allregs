                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining under section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.852-1 whether the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year  (without regard to capital gain dividends) by a regulated investment  company equals or exceeds 90 percent of its investment company taxable  income (determined without regard to the provisions of section  852(b)(2)(D)),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and Sec. 1.852-3), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.852-4 paid during the  taxable year, any dividend (or portion thereof) declared by the  investment company either before or after the close of the taxable year  but in any event before the time prescribed by law for the filing of its  return for the taxable year (including the period of any extension of  time granted for filing such return) shall, to the extent the company so  elects in such return, be treated as having been paid during such  taxable year. This rule is applicable only if the entire amount of such  dividend is actually distributed to the shareholders in the 12-month  period following the close of such taxable year and not later than the  date of the first regular dividend payment made after such declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method of making election. The election must be  made in the return filed by the company for the taxable year. The  election shall be made by the taxpayer (the regulated investment  company) by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which   such election applies as a dividend paid during the taxable year in  computing its investment company taxable income, or if the dividend (or  portion thereof) to which such election applies is to be designated by  the company as a capital gain dividend, in computing the amount of  capital gain dividends paid during such taxable year. The election  provided in section 855(a) may be made only to the extent that the  earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed with the application  of section 852(c) and Sec. 1.852-5) exceed the total amount of  distributions out of such earnings and profits actually made during the  taxable year (not including distributions with respect to which an  election has been made for a prior year under section 855(a)). The  dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which the regulated  investment company has made a valid election under section 855(a), shall  be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the taxable  year for which such election is made, and not out of the earnings and  profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Irrevocability of the election. After the expiration of the time  for filing the return for the taxable year for which an election is made  under section 855(a), such election shall be irrevocable with respect to  the dividend or portion thereof to which it applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receipt by shareholders. Under section 855(b), the dividend or  portion thereof, with respect to which a valid election has been made,  will be includible in the gross income of the shareholders of the  regulated investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend  is received by them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of  this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The X Company, a regulated investment company, had  taxable income (and earnings or profits) for the calendar year 1954 of  $100,000. During that year the company distributed to shareholders  taxable dividends aggregating $88,000. On March 10, 1955, the company  declared a dividend of $37,000 payable to shareholders on March 20,  1955. Such dividend consisted of the first regular quarterly dividend  for 1955 of $25,000 plus an additional $12,000 representing that part of  the taxable income for 1954 which was not distributed in 1954. On March  15, 1955, the X Company filed its federal income tax return and elected  therein to treat $12,000 of the total dividend of $37,000 to be paid to  shareholders on March 20, 1955, as having been paid during the taxable  year 1954. Assuming that the X Company actually distributed the entire  amount of the dividend of $37,000 on March 20, 1955, an amount equal to  $12,000 thereof will be treated for the purposes of section 852(a) as  having been paid during the taxable year 1954. Such amount ($12,000)  will be considered by the X Company as a distribution out of the  earnings and profits for the taxable year 1954, and will be treated by  the shareholders as a taxable dividend for the taxable year in which  such distribution is received by them.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The Y Company, a regulated investment company, had  taxable income (and earnings or profits) for the calendar year 1954 of  $100,000, and for 1955 taxable income (and earnings or profits) of  $125,000. On January 1, 1954, the company had a deficit in its earnings  and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, of $115,000. During the  year 1954 the company distributed to shareholders taxable dividends  aggregating $85,000. On March 5, 1955, the company declared a dividend  of $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1955. On March 15, 1955,  the Y Company filed its federal income tax return in which it included  $40,000 of the total dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on  March 31, 1955, as a dividend paid by it during the taxable year 1954.  On March 31, 1955, the Y Company distributed the entire amount of the  dividend of $65,000 declared on March 5, 1955. The election under  section 855(a) is valid only to the extent of $15,000, the amount of the  undistributed earnings and profits for 1954 ($100,000 earnings and  profits less $85,000 distributed during 1954). The remainder ($50,000)  of the $65,000 dividend paid on March 31, 1955, could not be the subject  of an election, and such amount will be regarded as a distribution by  the Y Company out of earnings and profits for the taxable year 1955.  Assuming that the only other distribution by the Y Company during 1955  was a distribution of $75,000 paid as a dividend on October 31, 1955,  the total amount of the distribution of $65,000 paid on March 31, 1955,  is to be treated by the shareholders as taxable dividends for the  taxable year in which such dividend is received. The Y Company will  treat the amount of $15,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits  of the company for the taxable year 1954, and the remaining $50,000 as a  distribution of the earnings or profits for the year 1955. The  distribution of $75,000 on October 31, 1955, is, of course, a taxable  dividend out of the earnings and profits for the year 1955.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to shareholders. Section 855(c) provides that in the case  of dividends, with respect to which a regulated investment company has  made an election under section 855(a), any notice to shareholders  required under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, with respect to such  amounts, shall be made not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable  year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable  year in which the distribution is made. Thus, the notice requirements of  section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.852-4 with respect to  capital gain dividends, section 853(c) and Sec. 1.853-3 with respect to  allowance to shareholder of foreign tax credit, and section 854(b)(2)  and Sec. 1.854-2 with respect to the amount of a distribution which may  be treated as a dividend, may be satisfied with respect to amounts to  which section 855(a) and this section apply if the notice relating to  such amounts is mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30  days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close  of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. If the notice  under section 855(c) relates to an election with respect to any capital  gain dividends, such capital gain dividends shall be aggregated by the  investment company with the designated capital gain dividends actually  paid during the taxable year to which the election applies (not  including such dividends with respect to which an election has been made  for a prior year under section 855) for the purpose of determining  whether the aggregate of the designated capital gain dividends with  respect to such taxable year of the company is greater than the excess  of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss  of the company. See section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of Sec.  1.852-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Foreign tax election. Section 855(d) provides that in the case  of an election made under section 853 (relating to foreign taxes), the  shareholder of the investment company shall consider the foreign income  received, and the foreign tax paid, as received and paid, respectively,  in the shareholder's taxable year in which distribution is made.
