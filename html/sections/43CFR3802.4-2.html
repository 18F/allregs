The authorized officer may also require the operator to utilize existing access routes in order to minimize the number of separate rights-of-way, and, if practicable, to construct access routes within a designated transportation and utility corridor. When commercial hauling is involved and the use of an existing access route is required, the authorized officer may require the operator to make appropriate arrangements for use and maintenance.</p>
