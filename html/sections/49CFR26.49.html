                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are an FTA recipient, you must require in your DBE  program that each transit vehicle manufacturer, as a condition of being  authorized to bid or propose on FTA-assisted transit vehicle  procurements, certify that it has complied with the requirements of this  section. You do not include FTA assistance used in transit vehicle  procurements in the base amount from which your overall goal is  calculated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only those transit vehicle manufacturers listed on FTA's  certified list of Transit Vehicle Manufacturers, or that have submitted  a goal methodology to FTA that has been approved or has not been  disapproved, at the time of solicitation are eligible to bid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A TVM's failure to implement the DBE Program in the manner as  prescribed in this section and throughout 49 CFR part 26 will be deemed  as non-compliance, which will result in removal from FTA's certified  TVMs list, resulting in that manufacturer becoming ineligible to bid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FTA recipient's failure to comply with the requirements set  forth in paragraph (a) of this section may result in formal enforcement  action or appropriate sanction as determined by FTA (e.g., FTA declining  to participate in the vehicle procurement).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FTA recipients are required to submit within 30 days of making  an award, the name of the successful bidder, and the total dollar value  of the contract in the manner prescribed in the grant agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are a transit vehicle manufacturer, you must establish  and submit for FTA's approval an annual overall percentage goal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In setting your overall goal, you should be guided, to the  extent applicable, by the principles underlying Sec. 26.45. The base  from which you calculate this goal is the amount of FTA financial  assistance included in transit vehicle contracts you will bid on during  the fiscal year in question, less the portion(s) attributable to the  manufacturing process performed entirely by the transit vehicle  manufacturer's own forces.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must consider and include in your base figure all domestic  contracting opportunities made available to non-DBE firms; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must exclude from this base figure funds attributable to  work performed outside the United States and its territories,  possessions, and commonwealths.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In establishing an overall goal, the transit vehicle  manufacturer must provide for public participation. This includes  consultation with interested parties consistent with Sec. 26.45(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of this part with respect to submission and  approval of overall goals apply to you as they do to recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transit vehicle manufacturers awarded must comply with the  reporting requirements of Sec. 26.11 of this part including the  requirement to submit the Uniform Report of Awards or Commitments and  Payments, in order to remain eligible to bid on FTA assisted transit  vehicle procurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transit vehicle manufacturers must implement all other  applicable requirements of this part, except those relating to UCPs and  DBE certification procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you are an FHWA or FAA recipient, you may, with FHWA or FAA  approval, use the procedures of this section with respect to  procurements of vehicles or specialized equipment. If you choose to do  so, then the manufacturers of this equipment must meet the same  requirements (including goal approval by FHWA or FAA) as transit vehicle  manufacturers must meet in FTA-assisted procurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As a recipient you may, with FTA approval, establish project- specific goals for DBE participation in the procurement of transit  vehicles in lieu of complying through the procedures of this section.
