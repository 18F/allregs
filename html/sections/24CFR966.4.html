This policy takes into account the importance of eviction of such residents to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assessment under PHAS. Under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), PHAs that have adopted policies, implemented procedures and can document that they appropriately evict any public housing residents who engage in certain activity detrimental to the public housing community receive points. (See 24 CFR 902.43(a)(5).) This policy takes into account the importance of eviction of such residents to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consideration of circumstances. In a manner consistent with such policies, procedures and practices, the PHA may consider all circumstances relevant to a particular case such as the seriousness of the offending action, the extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action, the effects that the eviction would have on family members not involved in the offending activity and the extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exclusion of culpable household member. The PHA may require a tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Consideration of rehabilitation. In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use,

or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13662). For this purpose, the PHA may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Length of period of mandatory prohibition on admission. If a statute requires that the PHA prohibit admission of persons for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, the PHA may apply that prohibition for a longer period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Nondiscrimination limitation. The PHA's eviction actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of Sec. 5.105 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Eviction: Right to examine PHA documents before hearing or trial. The PHA shall provide the tenant a reasonable opportunity to examine, at the tenant's request, before a PHA grievance hearing or court trial concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, any documents, including records and regulations, which are in the possession of the PHA, and which are directly relevant to the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant shall be allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. A notice of lease termination pursuant to Sec. 966.4(l) (3) shall inform the tenant of the tenant's right to examine PHA documents concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. If the PHA does not make documents available for examination upon request by the tenant (in accordance with this Sec. 966.4(m)), the PHA may not proceed with the eviction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Grievance procedures. The lease shall provide that all disputes concerning the obligations of the tenant or the PHA shall (except as provided in Sec. 966.51(a)(2)) be resolved in accordance with the PHA grievance procedures. The grievance procedures shall comply with subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Provision for modifications. The lease shall provide that modification of the lease must be accomplished by a written rider to the lease executed by both parties, except for paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 966.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Signature clause. The lease shall provide a signature clause attesting that the lease has been executed by the parties.
