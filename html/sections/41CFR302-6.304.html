                            <p class="depth0">When determining whether to offer an employee the lump sum payment option for TQSE the following factors should be considered:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ease of administration. A lump sum for TQSE is paid to the employee prior to the occupancy of TQ, and the after the fact voucher process is eliminated under this method. Actual TQSE reimbursement requires an agency to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost consideration. You should weigh the cost of each alternative. Actual TQSE reimbursement may extend

up to 120 days, while the lump sum payment is limited to a maximum of 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of employee. The employee is allowed to choose between actual TQSE reimbursement and the lump sum TQSE payment when you offer the lump sum payment method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.
