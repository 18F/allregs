                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. There are four categories of information in an  antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding: public, business  proprietary, privileged, and classified. In general, public information  is information that may be made available to the public, whereas  business proprietary information may be disclosed (if at all) only to  authorized applicants under an APO. Privileged and classified  information may not be disclosed at all, even under an APO. This section  describes the four categories of information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public information. The Secretary normally will consider the  following to be public information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factual information of a type that has been published or  otherwise made available to the public by the person submitting it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factual information that is not designated as business  proprietary by the person submitting it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factual information that, although designated as business  proprietary by the person submitting it, is in a form that cannot be  associated with or otherwise used to identify activities of a particular  person or that the Secretary determines is not properly designated as  business proprietary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Publicly available laws, regulations, decrees, orders, and other  official documents of a country, including English translations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Written argument relating to the proceeding that is not  designated as business proprietary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Business proprietary information. The Secretary normally will  consider the following factual information to be business proprietary  information, if so designated by the submitter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business or trade secrets concerning the nature of a product or  production process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production costs (but not the identity of the production  components unless a particular component is a trade secret);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distribution costs (but not channels of distribution);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Terms of sale (but not terms of sale offered to the public);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prices of individual sales, likely sales, or other offers (but  not components of prices, such as transportation, if based on published  schedules, dates of sale, product descriptions (other than business or  trade secrets described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section), or order  numbers);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Names of particular customers, distributors, or suppliers (but  not destination of sale or designation of type of customer, distributor,  or supplier, unless the destination or designation would reveal the  name);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In an antidumping proceeding, the exact amount of the dumping  margin on individual sales;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In a countervailing duty proceeding, the exact amount of the  benefit applied for or received by a person from each of the programs  under investigation or review (but not descriptions of the operations of  the programs, or the amount if included in official public statements or  documents or publications, or the ad valorem countervailable subsidy  rate calculated for each person under a program);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The names of particular persons from whom business proprietary  information was obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The position of a domestic producer or workers regarding a  petition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Any other specific business information the release of which to  the public would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of  the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Privileged information. The Secretary will consider information  privileged if, based on principles of law concerning privileged  information, the Secretary decides that the information should not be  released to the public or to parties to the proceeding. Privileged  information is exempt from disclosure to the public or to  representatives of interested parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Classified information. Classified information is information  that is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 of April 2, 1982 (47  FR 14874 and 15557, 3 CFR 1982 Comp. p. 166) or successor executive  order, if applicable. Classified information is exempt from disclosure  to the public or to representatives of interested parties.</p>
