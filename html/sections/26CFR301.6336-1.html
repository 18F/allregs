If the owner of the property can be readily  found, the district director shall give him written notice of his  determination of the appraised value of the property. However, if the  district director determines that the circumstances require immediate  action, he may give the owner an oral notice of his determination of the  appraised value of the property, which notice shall be confirmed in  writing prior to sale. The property shall be returned to the owner if,  within the time specified in the notice, the owner--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pays to the district director an amount equal to the appraised  value, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gives an acceptable bond as prescribed by section 7101 and Sec.  301.7101-1. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than the appraised  value of the property and shall be conditioned upon the payment of such  amount at such time as the district director determines to be  appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediate sale. If the owner does not pay the amount of the  appraised value of the seized property within the time specified in the  notice, or furnish bond as provided in paragraph (b) of this section  within such time, the district director shall as soon as practicable  make public sale of the property in accordance with the following terms  and conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of sale. If the owner can readily be found, a notice  shall be given to him. A notice of sale also shall be posted in two  public places in the county in which the property is to be sold.

The district director may  give such other notice and in such other manner as he deems advisable  under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sale.
