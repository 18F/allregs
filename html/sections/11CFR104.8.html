This  identification shall include the individual's name, mailing address,  occupation, the name of his or her employer, if any, and the date of  receipt and amount of any such contribution. If an individual  contributor's name is known to have changed since an earlier  contribution reported during the calendar year (or during the election  cycle, in the case of an authorized committee), the exact name or  address previously used shall be noted with the first reported  contribution from that contributor subsequent to the name change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In each case where a contribution received from an individual in  a reporting period is added to previously unitemized contributions from  the same individual and the aggregate exceeds $200 in a calendar year  (or in an election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee) the  reporting political committee shall disclose the identification of such  individual along with the date of receipt and amount of any such  contribution.
