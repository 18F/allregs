                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">National pretreatment standards specifying quantities or  concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be  discharged to a POTW by existing or new industrial users in specific  industrial subcategories will be established as separate regulations  under the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. These  standards, unless specifically noted otherwise, shall be in addition to  all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Category determination request--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application deadline. Within  60 days after the effective date of a Pretreatment Standard for a  subcategory under which an Industrial User may be included, the  Industrial User or POTW may request that the Water Management Division  Director or Director, as appropriate, provide written certification on  whether the Industrial User falls within that particular subcategory. If  an existing Industrial User adds or changes a process or operation which  may be included in a subcategory, the existing Industrial User must  request this certification   prior to commencing discharge from the added or changed processes or  operation. A New Source must request this certification prior to  commencing discharge. Where a request for certification is submitted by  a POTW, the POTW shall notify any affected Industrial User of such  submission. The Industrial User may provide written comments on the POTW  submission to the Water Management Division Director or Director, as  appropriate, within 30 days of notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of application. Each request shall contain a statement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Describing which subcategories might be applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Citing evidence and reasons why a particular subcategory is  applicable and why others are not applicable. Any person signing the  application statement submitted pursuant to this section shall make the  following certification:</p><p class="depth0">I certify under penalty of law that this document and all  attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in  accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel  properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my  inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons  directly responsible for gathering the information, the information  submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate,  and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for  submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and  imprisonment for knowing violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deficient requests. The Water Management Division Director or  Director will only act on written requests for determinations that  contain all of the information required. Persons who have made  incomplete submissions will be notified by the Water Management Division  Director or Director that their requests are deficient and, unless the  time period is extended, will be given 30 days to correct the  deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within 30 days or within  an extended period allowed by the Water Management Division Director or  the Director, the request for a determination shall be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Final decision. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the Water Management Division Director  or Director receives a submittal he or she will, after determining that  it contains all of the information required by paragraph (2) of this  section, consider the submission, any additional evidence that may have  been requested, and any other available information relevant to the  request. The Water Management Division Director or Director will then  make a written determination of the applicable subcategory and state the  reasons for the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the request is submitted to the Director, the Director  shall forward the determination described in this paragraph to the Water  Management Division Director who may make a final determination. The  Water Management Division Director may waive receipt of these  determinations. If the Water Management Division Director does not  modify the Director's decision within 60 days after receipt thereof, or  if the Water Management Division Director waives receipt of the  determination, the Director's decision is final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where the request is submitted by the Industrial User or POTW  to the Water Management Division Director or where the Water Management  Division Director elects to modify the Director's decision, the Water  Management Division Director's decision will be final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Water Management Division Director or Director, as  appropriate, shall send a copy of the determination to the affected  Industrial User and the POTW. Where the final determination is made by  the Water Management Division Director, he or she shall send a copy of  the determination to the Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requests for hearing and/or legal decision. Within 30 days  following the date of receipt of notice of the final determination as  provided for by paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, the Requester may  submit a petition to reconsider or contest the decision to the Regional  Administrator who shall act on such petition expeditiously and state the  reasons for his or her determination in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deadline for compliance with categorical standards. Compliance  by existing sources with categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be  within 3 years of the date the Standard is effective unless a shorter  compliance time is specified in the appropriate   subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. Direct dischargers with NPDES  Permits modified or reissued to provide a variance pursuant to section  301(i)(2) of the Act shall be required to meet compliance dates set in  any applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. Existing sources which  become Industrial Users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable  categorical Pretreatment Standard shall be considered existing  Industrial Users except where such sources meet the definition of a New  Source as defined in Sec. 403.3(m). New Sources shall install and have  in operating condition, and shall ``start-up'' all pollution control  equipment required to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards before  beginning to Discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed  90 days), New Sources must meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Concentration and mass limits. Pollutant discharge limits in  categorical Pretreatment Standards will be expressed either as  concentration or mass limits. Wherever possible, where concentration  limits are specified in standards, equivalent mass limits will be  provided so that local, State or Federal authorities responsible for  enforcement may use either concentration or mass limits. Limits in  categorical Pretreatment Standards shall apply to the effluent of the  process regulated by the Standard, or as otherwise specified by the  standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are  expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the  Control Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations  expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent  concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations  applicable to individual Industrial Users.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A Control Authority calculating equivalent mass-per-day  limitations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall calculate such  limitations by multiplying the limits in the Standard by the Industrial  User's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall  be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a  reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long-term daily  production, such as the average daily production during a representative  year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using  projected production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A Control Authority calculating equivalent concentration  limitations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall calculate such  limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived under paragraph  (c)(3) of this section by the average daily flow rate of the Industrial  User's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall  be based upon a reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long- term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the  representative year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)(E)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User  must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation  methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the  term of its control mechanism;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to  achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment  Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's  actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from  a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's  long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow  rate and long-term average production rate must be representative of  current operating conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant  levels that vary so significantly that equivalent   mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical  Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's  request for equivalent mass limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment  technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass  limits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of  a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this section. Upon notification of a revised  production rate, the Control Authority must reassess the equivalent mass  limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at  the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation  methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph  (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section so long as it discharges under an  equivalent mass limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A Control Authority which chooses to establish equivalent mass  limits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the  actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the  Industrial User by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly  average Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard  and the appropriate unit conversion factor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Upon notification of a revised production rate, must reassess  the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to  reflect changed conditions at the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control  mechanism terms if the Industrial User's actual average daily flow rate  was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water  conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow  rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were  not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant  to paragraph (d) of this section. The Industrial User must also be in  compliance with Sec. 403.17 (regarding the prohibition of bypass).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Control Authority may not express limits in terms of mass  for pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants  which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Control Authority may convert the mass limits of the  categorical Pretreatment Standards at 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 to  concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable  to individual Industrial Users under the following conditions. When  converting such limits to concentration limits, the Control Authority  must use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR  parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being  substituted for treatment as prohibited by paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with paragraphs  (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section are deemed  Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act and  this part. The Control Authority must document how the equivalent limits  were derived and make this information publicly available. Once  incorporated into its control mechanism, the Industrial User must comply  with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical  standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for  calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for  calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations.  Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow  figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum  equivalent limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any Industrial User operating under a control mechanism  incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a  production based standard shall notify the   Control Authority within two (2) business days after the User has a  reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly  change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the  Control Authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet  the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were  based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. Except where  expressly authorized to do so by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or  Requirement, no Industrial User shall ever increase the use of process  water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a Discharge as a partial or  complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a  Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Control Authority may impose  mass limitations on Industrial Users which are using dilution to meet  applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases  where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Combined wastestream formula. Where process effluent is mixed  prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the  regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by  the Control Authority or by the Industrial User with the written  concurrence of the Control Authority. These alternative limits shall be  applied to the mixed effluent. When deriving alternative categorical  limits, the Control Authority or Industrial User shall calculate both an  alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum value(s)  specified in the appropriate categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) and an  alternative consecutive sampling day average value using the monthly  average value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical Pretreatment  Standard(s). The Industrial User shall comply with the alternative daily  maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the Control Authority until  the Control Authority modifies the limits or approves an Industrial User  modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a  material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to  fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An Industrial User  must immediately report any such material or significant change to the  Control Authority. Where appropriate new alternative categorical limits  shall be calculated within 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative limit calculation. For purposes of these formulas,  the ``average daily flow'' means a reasonable measure of the average  daily flow for a 30-day period. For new sources, flows shall be  estimated using projected values. The alternative limit for a specified  pollutant will be derived by the use of either of the following  formulas:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Alternative concentration limit.</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.012</p><p class="depth0">where  CT=the alternative concentration limit for the combined</p><p class="depth0">wastestream.

Where a treated regulated process  wastestream is combined prior to treatment with wastewaters other than  those generated by the regulated process, the Industrial User may  monitor either the segregated process wastestream or the combined  wastestream for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable  Pretreatment Standards. If the Industrial User chooses to monitor the  segregated process wastestream, it shall apply the applicable  categorical Pretreatment Standard. If the User chooses to monitor the  combined wastestream, it shall apply an alternative discharge limit  calculated using the combined wastestream formula as provided in this  section. The Industrial User may change monitoring points only after  receiving approval from the   Control Authority. The Control Authority shall ensure that any change in  an Industrial User's monitoring point(s) will not allow the User to  substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with  applicable Standards.
