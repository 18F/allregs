                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-CERP baseline water availability and quality. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not later  than June 14, 2004 the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District shall, in consultation with the Department of the  Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe  of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies, develop for approval by the  Secretary of the Army, the pre-CERP baseline to be used to aid the Corps  of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District in  determining if existing legal sources of water will be eliminated or  transferred as a result of project implementation as described in  Sec. 385.36 and memorialize the pre-CERP baseline in an appropriate  document. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force in the development of the pre-CERP baseline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pre-CERP baseline may express the quantity, timing, and  distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency  curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any  other method which is based on the best available science.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pre-CERP baseline shall include appropriate documentation  that includes a description of the assumptions used to develop the pre- CERP baseline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In addition to the development of the pre-CERP baseline, the  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall  conduct other analyses that they deem necessary to determine if an  existing legal source of water has been eliminated or transferred or if  a new source of water is of comparable quality to that which has been  eliminated or transferred in accordance with Sec. 385.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with Sec. 385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District shall provide opportunities for  the public to review and comment on the pre-CERP baseline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pre-CERP baseline shall be developed with the concurrence of  the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. Within 180 days of being  provided the pre-CERP baseline, or such shorter period that the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may agree to, the Secretary  of the Interior and the Governor shall provide the Secretary of the Army  with a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence with the pre- CERP baseline. A failure to provide a written statement of concurrence  or non-concurrence within such time frame shall be deemed as meeting the  concurrency process of this section. A copy of any concurrency or non- concurrency statements shall be made a part of the administrative record  and referenced in the final determination of the pre-CERP baseline. Any  non-concurrency statement shall specifically detail the reason or  reasons for the non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, or shall it be  interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process  for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida  law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted  to, prescribe any process of Florida law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification of water made available and water to be reserved  or allocated for the natural system. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial modeling showed that  most of the water generated by the Plan would go to the natural system  in order to attain restoration goals, and the remainder of the water  would go for use in the human environment. The Corps of Engineers, the  South Florida Water Management District, and other non-Federal sponsors  shall ensure that Project Implementation Reports identify the  appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be dedicated  and managed for the natural system that is necessary to meet the  restoration goals of the Plan. In accordance with the ``Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement,''  dated January 9, 2002 pursuant to section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000, the  South Florida Water Management District or the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection shall make sufficient reservations of water for  the natural system under State law in accordance with the Project  Implementation Report for that project and consistent with the Plan  before water made available by a project is permitted for a consumptive  use or otherwise made unavailable. In accordance with Sec. 385.31(c),  the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida,  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies, determine the total quantity of water that is  expected to be generated by implementation of the Plan, including the  quantity expected to be generated for the natural system to attain  restoration goals as well as the quantity expected to be generated for  use in the human environment, and shall periodically update that  estimate, as appropriate, based on new information resulting from  changed or   unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, new  or updated models, or information developed through the adaptive  assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized  changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Project Implementation Report shall take into account the  availability of pre-CERP baseline water and previously reserved water as  well as the estimated total quantity of water that is necessary for  restoration for the natural system and the quantity of water anticipated  to be made available from future projects in identifying the appropriate  quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for  the natural system, determining whether improvements in water quality  are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets  applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of water  for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the  provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(C)(i)(I)</em> of WRDA 2000 requires the regulations  of this part to establish a process for development of Project  Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating  Manuals that ensure that the goals and objectives of the Plan are  achieved. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) of WRDA 2000 provides that  Project Implementation Reports shall identify the appropriate quantity,  timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural  system. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000 provides that Project  Implementation Reports shall identify the amount of water to be reserved  or allocated for the natural system necessary to implement, under State  law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) and (VI) of WRDA  2000. To implement these provisions and Sec. 385.5, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop  a guidance memorandum in accordance with Sec. 385.5 for approval by the  Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor. The guidance memorandum shall provide a  process to be used in the preparation of Project Implementation Reports  for identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of  water dedicated and managed for the natural system; determining the  quantity, timing and distribution of water made available for other  water-related needs of the region; determining whether improvements in  water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered by the Plan  meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of  water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law,  the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii) of WRDA 2000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The guidance memorandum shall generally be based on using a  system-wide analysis of the water made available and may express the  quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration curves;  exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and  dry years; or any other method which is based on the best available  science. The guidance memorandum shall also provide for projects that  are hydrologically separate from the rest of the system. The guidance  memorandum also shall address procedures for determining whether  improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water  delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality  standards. These procedures shall ensure that any features to improve  water quality are implemented in a manner consistent with the cost  sharing provisions of WRDA 1996 and WRDA 2000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The guidance memorandum shall generally take into account the  natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year based on  an appropriate period of record; the objective of restoration of the  natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to  new sources; contingencies for drought protection; the need to identify  the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made  available by a new project component while maintaining a system-wide  perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan; and   the need to determine whether improvements in water quality are  necessary to ensure that water delivered by the Plan meets applicable  water quality standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Project Implementation Reports approved before December 12,  2003 or before the development of the guidance memorandum may use  whatever method that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor  deem is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of section 601 of  WRDA 2000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, or shall it be  interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process  for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida  law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted  to, prescribe any process of Florida law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures in event that the project does not perform as  expected. The Project Implementation Report shall include a plan for  operations of the project in the event that the project fails to provide  the quantity, timing, or distribution of water described in the Project  Implementation Report. Such plan shall take into account the specific  authorized purposes of the project and the goals and purposes of the  Plan and shall also provide for undertaking management actions in  accordance with Sec. 385.31(d).</p>
