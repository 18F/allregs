Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in Sec. 2554.27(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Avoid needless consumption of time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.
