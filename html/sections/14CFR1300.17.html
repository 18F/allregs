                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility screening. Applications will be reviewed to  determine whether the lender and borrower are eligible, the information  required under Sec. 1300.16(b) is complete, and the proposed loan  complies with applicable statutes and regulations. The Board may at any  time reject an application that does not meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation criteria. Applications that are determined to be  eligible pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to a  substantive review by the Board. In addition to the general standards  for Board issuance of Federal credit instruments set forth in   Sec. 1300.10, the Board shall consider the following evaluation  factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable assurance that the borrower will be able to repay the  loan by the date specified in the loan document, which shall be no later  than seven years from the date on which the first disbursement of the  loan is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The adequacy of the proposed provisions to protect the Federal  Government, including sufficiency of any security provided by the  borrower and the percentage of guarantee requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ability of the lender to administer the loan in full  compliance with the requisite standard of care. In making this  determination, the Board will assess:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lender's level of regulatory capital, in the case of banking  institutions, or net worth, in the case of other institutions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the lender possesses the ability to administer the  loan, including its experience with loans to air carriers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other matter the Board deems material to its assessment of  the lender; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ability of the borrower to demonstrate, to the Board's  satisfaction, one or more of the following criteria. The Board shall  give preference to applications that satisfy one or more of these  criteria, giving greater preference to those applications that meet the  greatest number of these criteria, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A demonstration that the air carrier has presented a plan  demonstrating that its business plan is financially sound;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A demonstration of greater participation in the loan by non- Federal entities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A demonstration of greater participation in the loan by  private entities, as opposed to public non-Federal entities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A demonstration that the proposed instruments would ensure that  the Federal Government will, contingent on the financial success of the  air carrier, participate in the gains of the air carrier and its  security holders;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A demonstration of concessions by the air carrier's security  holders, other creditors, or employees that will improve the financial  condition of the air carrier in a manner that will enable it to repay  the loan in accordance with its terms and provide commercial air  services on a financially sound basis after repayment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A demonstration that guaranteed loan proceeds will be used for  a purpose other than the payment or refinancing of existing debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A demonstration that the proposed instruments contain  financial structures that minimize the Federal government's risk and  cost associated with making loan guarantees. Examples include, but are  not limited to, requests for guarantees that contain the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A maturity period that is less than the maximum permitted under  the rules in this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pledges of collateral;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Agreements by the borrower's parent or other entities to  reimburse the Federal government for any payments that the Federal  government may make under the guarantee;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A grant to the Federal government of favorable priority in the  event of bankruptcy reflecting other creditors' agreement to subordinate  their debts as a condition of the loan guarantee;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Limitation of the borrower's issuance of dividends and/or the  borrower's payments to its parent or subsidiaries or related companies;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Limitation of the borrower's ability to incur additional debt,  and/or the borrower's ability to incur capital expenditures, beyond that  set forth in the business and financial plans that the Borrower  submitted with the application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A demonstration of reasonable liquidity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> A demonstration of favorable debt ratios; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> A demonstration that any proceeds raised from private sector  financing subsequent to disbursement of the federally guaranteed loan be  used to repay the federally guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No guarantee will be made if either the borrower or lender has  an outstanding delinquent Federal debt, including tax liabilities,  until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The delinquent debt has been paid in full;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A negotiated repayment schedule is established; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other arrangements, satisfactory to the agency responsible for  collecting the debt are made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decisions by the Board. The Board shall approve or deny  applications received on or before June 28, 2002, in a timely manner as  such applications are received. The Board may limit the amount of a loan  guarantee made to initial applicants to ensure that sufficient funds  remain available for subsequent applicants. The Board shall notify the  borrower in writing of the approval or denial of an application.  Approvals for loan guarantees shall be conditioned upon compliance with  Sec. 1300.18.</p>
