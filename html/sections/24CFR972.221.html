A PHA that wishes to convert a public  housing development to tenant-based assistance must submit a conversion  assessment to HUD with its next PHA Annual Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Updated conversion assessment. Where a PHA proposes to convert a  development to tenant-based assistance, it must submit an updated  conversion assessment if the conversion assessment otherwise would be  more than one year older than the conversion plan to be submitted to  HUD. To update a conversion assessment, a PHA must ensure that the  analysis of rental market conditions is based on the most recently  available data, and must include any data that have changed since the  initial conversion assessment. A PHA may submit the initial cost  analysis and comparison of the market value of the public housing before  and after rehabilitation and/or conversion if there is no reason to  believe that such information has changed significantly.</p>
