                                Sec. 10.700  May a claimant designate a representative?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The claims process under the FECA is informal. Unlike many workers' compensation laws, the employer is not a party to the claim, and OWCP acts as an impartial evaluator of the evidence. Nevertheless, a claimant may appoint one individual to represent his or her interests, but the appointment must be in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There can be only one representative at any one time, so after one representative has been properly appointed, OWCP will not recognize another individual as representative until the claimant withdraws the authorization of the first individual. In addition, OWCP will recognize only certain types of individuals (see Sec. 10.701); however if the representative is an attorney, OWCP may communicate with any member of that attorney's recognized law firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A properly appointed representative who is recognized by OWCP may make a request or give direction to OWCP regarding the claims process, including a hearing. This authority includes presenting or eliciting evidence, making arguments on facts or the law, and obtaining information from the case file, to the same extent as the claimant.</p>
