The surfclam and ocean quahog ACLs will be established consistent with the guidelines contained in the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP.

and non-Maine components of the fishery according to the allocation guidelines of the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP as specified in Sec. 648.78(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Periodicity. The surfclam and ocean quahog ACLs may be established on an annual basis for up to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC recommendations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance review. The MAFMC staff shall conduct a detailed review of the fishery performance relative to the ACLs at least every 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the surfclam or the ocean quahog ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent (i.e., more than once in 4 years or any 2 consecutive years), the MAFMC staff will review fishery performance information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for changes in measures intended to ensure the ACL is not exceeded as frequently.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following a determination that a stock has become overfished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be conducted in conjunction with such reviews.
