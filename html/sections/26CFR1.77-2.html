                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a taxpayer elects or has elected under section 77, section 123 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 223(d) of the Revenue Act of 1939 (53 Stat. 897), as amended, to include in his gross income the amount of a loan from the Commodity Credit Corporation for the taxable year in which it is received, then--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No part of the amount realized by the Commodity Credit Corporation upon the sale or other disposition of the commodity pledged for such loan shall be recognized as income to the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer receives an amount in addition to that advanced to him as the loan, in which event such additional amount shall be included in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year in which it is received, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No deductible loss to the taxpayer shall be recognized on account of any deficiency realized by the Commodity Credit Corporation on such loan if the taxpayer was relieved from liability for such deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A, a taxpayer who elected for his taxable year 1952 to include in gross income amounts received as loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation, received as loans $500 in 1952, $700 in 1953, and $900 in 1954. In 1956 all the pledged commodity was sold by the Commodity Credit Corporation for an amount $100 and $200 less than the loans with respect to the commodity pledged in 1952 and 1953, respectively, and for an amount $150 greater than the loan with respect to the commodity pledged in 1954. A, in making his return for 1956, shall include in gross income the sum of $150 if it is received during that year, but will not be allowed a deduction for the deficiencies of $100 and $200 unless he is required to satisfy such deficiencies and does satisfy them during that year.</p>
