                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. PHAs are required by the CF ACC to carry various types  of insurance to protect it from loss. In most cases, insurance coverage  will be the primary source of funding to pay repair or replacement costs  associated with emergencies and natural disasters. Where the  Department's Annual Appropriations Act establishes a set-aside from the  Capital Fund appropriation for emergencies and natural disasters, the  procedures in this section apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergencies and natural disasters. An emergency is an unforeseen  or unpreventable event or occurrence that poses an immediate threat to  the health and safety of the residents that must be corrected within one  year of funding. A natural disaster for purposes of the Capital Fund  reserve, is a non-presidentially declared disaster. In the event an  emergency or natural disaster arises, HUD may require a PHA to use any  other source that may legally be available, including unobligated  Capital Funds, prior to providing emergency or natural disaster funds  from the set-aside. The Department will review, on a case-by-case basis,  requests for emergency and natural disaster funding from PHAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure to request emergency or natural disaster funds. To  obtain emergency or natural disaster funds, a PHA shall submit a written  request in the form and manner prescribed by HUD. In a natural disaster  where the PHA requires immediate relief to preserve the property and  safety of the residents, the PHA may submit a preliminary request  outlined in paragraph (d) of this section. Subsequently, the PHA is  required to complete and submit the remaining information outlined in  paragraph (e) of this section, at a time prescribed by HUD. For  emergency requests, PHAs are to follow the procedures outlined in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure to request preliminary natural disaster grant for  immediate preservation. A PHA may request a preliminary grant only for  costs necessary for immediate preservation of the property and safety of  the residents. The application should include the reasonable  identification of damage and preservation costs as determined by the  PHA. An independent assessment will be required when the PHA submits the  final request or when the PHA reconciles the preliminary application  grant with the actual amounts received from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), insurance carriers, and other natural disaster  relief sources. Regardless of whether further funding from the set-aside  is requested, at a time specified by HUD, the PHA will be expected to  provide a reconciliation of all funds received, to ensure that the PHA  does not receive duplicate funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedure for an emergency or a final request for natural  disaster funds. In the request the PHA shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the public housing project(s) with the emergency or  natural disaster condition(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify and provide the date of the conditions that present an  unforeseen or unpreventable threat to the health, life, or safety of  residents, in the case of emergency; or Natural disaster (e.g.,  hurricane, tornado, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Describe the activities that will be undertaken to correct the  emergency or the conditions caused by the natural disaster and the  estimated cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide an independent assessment of the extent of and the cost  to correct the condition. The assessment must be specific as to the  damage and costs associated with the emergency or natural disaster. An  independent estimate of damage and repair cost is required as a part of  the final natural disaster application. For natural disasters, the  assessment must identify damage specifically caused by the natural  disaster. The set-aside can be used only to pay costs to repair or  replace a public housing project damaged as a result of the natural  disaster, not for nonroutine maintenance or other improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide a copy of a currently effective DOT covering the  property and an opinion of counsel that there are no preexisting liens  or other encumbrances on the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Demonstrate that without the requested funds from the set-aside,  the PHA does not have adequate funds available to correct the emergency  condition(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Identify all other sources of available funds (e.g., insurance  proceeds, FEMA).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any other material required by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> HUD Action. HUD shall review all requests for emergency or  natural disaster funds. If HUD determines that a PHA's request meets the  requirements of this section, HUD shall approve the request subject to  the availability of funds in the set-aside, in the order in which  requests are received and are determined approvable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Submission of the CF ACC. Upon being provided with a CF ACC  Amendment from HUD, the PHA must sign and date the CF ACC Amendment and  return it to HUD by the date established by HUD. HUD will execute the  signed and dated CF ACC Amendment submitted by the PHA.</p>
