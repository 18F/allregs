                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The term ``wire and equipment service'' includes stock quotation and information services, burglar alarm or fire alarm service, and all other similar services (whether or not oral transmission is involved). In general, the term relates to wire lines or channels and equipment by means of which information or services are furnished to the subscriber. The phrase ``all other similar services'' includes innovations in the wire and

equipment field. The term does not include teletypewriter exchange service or any service furnished by any means other than wire communication. Tax is imposed on the amounts paid for such wire lines or channels, equipment, and information or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following are examples of wire and equipment service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Burglar, fire, or other alarm service where the service consists of wire lines or channels furnished between a remote point and the subscriber's premises, or a police or fire station, or a central station, and over which a signal is transmitted in the case of illegal entry, fire, leakage, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wire lines or channels furnished between a point of origin and the subscriber's premises over which are given stock and bond market quotations and reports, racing results, baseball scores, and other sporting results, news items, musical programs, weather reports, the time, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Metering services, including wire lines or channels and equipment, furnished between a remote point and the subscriber's premises, over which signals are transmitted so that the subscriber may obtain information as to a given condition at the remote point, such as water level, water pressure, gas pressure, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remote control wire lines or channels furnished between a remote point and the subscriber's premises over which signals are transmitted which will actuate an instrument at the remote point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amounts paid. In determining the amount of tax due, the amount paid for the service shall include all charges made in connection with the furnishing of any wire and equipment services, such as salaries of operators, if in the employ of the person furnishing such service, charges for equipment, instruments, and other apparatus. Where the service rendered includes the furnishing of information or programs such as stock market quotations, baseball scores, racing results, weather reports, or musical programs, etc., any amounts charged for information or programs furnished shall also be included, whether or not individual items are charged or billed separately. In cases where a person leases lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities used in conjunction with wire and equipment service, the amounts paid by such person for such lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities constitute amounts paid for wire and equipment service, notwithstanding the fact that the lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities used in conjunction with such service are supplied by different persons or in part by the user of such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relationship to wire mileage service. The tax on wire mileage service does not apply in respect of any service which is used exclusively in furnishing wire and equipment service. See Sec. 49.4252-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemptions. For exemptions from the tax imposed on amounts paid for wire and equipment service, see sections 4253, 4292, 4293, and 4294, and the regulations thereunder contained in this part.</p>
