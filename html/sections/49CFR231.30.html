(See Plate A)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Horizontal end handholds. Each locomotive used in switching service must have four (4) horizontal end handholds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each horizontal end handhold must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be constructed of wrought iron, steel or other material of equivalent strength and durability that is at least five-eighths (\5/8\) inch in diameter and be securely fastened to the locomotive with one-half (\1/2\) inch or larger bolts or rivets;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be located not less than thirty (30) inches nor more than fifty (50) inches above the top of rail with its outer end not more than 16 inches from the side of the locomotive; on units with a high snowplow that makes normal end handhold location inaccessible, end handhold shall be located on top of plow blade, with the center of the handhold not more than fifty-three (53) inches above the top of rail, and be in line with the slope of the plow blade;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be at least fourteen (14) inches long; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide at least two (2) inches, preferably two and one-half (2\1/2\) inches, usable hand clearance throughout its entire length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An uncoupling lever may also serve as a horizontal end handhold if it complies with the requirements of this paragraph. When an uncoupling lever also serves as the horizontal end handhold, it is considered to be securely fastened if its securement brackets are attached to the locomotive by one-half (\1/2\) inch or larger bolts or rivets and its movement between those brackets is limited to the rotation necessary for performance of the uncoupling function.
