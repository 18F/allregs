                            <p class="depth0">A Bank in its capital plan may allow a member to transfer any excess  capital stock of the Bank to another member of that Bank or to an  institution that has been approved for membership in that Bank and that  has satisfied all conditions for becoming a member, other than the  purchase of the minimum amount of Bank stock that it is required to hold  as a condition of membership. Any such stock transfers shall be at par  value and shall be effective upon being recorded on the appropriate  books and records of the Bank. The Bank may, in its capital plan,  require a member to receive the approval of the Bank before a transfer  of the Bank's stock, as allowed under this section, is completed.
