                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Division and District Engineers will be available to  the military elements for consultation and review of requirements  involving construction on leased land or in leased   space. Detailed instructions are furnished in DOD Directives 4165.12,  4165.16, 4165.20, 4270.24, 5160.58, 7040.2; DOD Instruction 5305.5; Army  Regulations 140-485, 405-10, 415-25, 415-35, 420-10. Section 644.135(b)  covers the requirements of the Economy Act which are applicable to  alterations and construction on leased real property. The work to be  performed must be essential. Guidelines are furnished as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed alterations and improvements must be advantageous  to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, and, where  applicable, to national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For office space, the cost should be less than the cost of other  space that is available and which does not require alterations or  improvements to any appreciable extent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Due regard is to be given to the convenience of the public that  is served and the maintenance and improvement of safe and healthful  working conditions of employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the proposed temporary construction at a leased facility  has an estimated cost equal to or in excess of the current market value  of the property, the facts will be reported promptly to DAEN-REA-L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial and subsequent alterations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial alterations to  facilities leased by the Corps are the responsibility of the appropriate  Division or District Engineer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effort will be made to include all required alterations in the  rental package with the lessor performing all of the work. Careful  attention will be given to possible violations of the Economy Act.  Payment for initial alterations may be in a lump sum or by the month  with the rent, provided the provisions of the Economy Act are complied  with and the alterations costs are stated separately in the file or in  the voucher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alterations or improvements of any nature in GSA furnished space  are the responsibility of GSA. Under certain circumstances, GSA may  require a Certificate of Necessity in order to perform the required  construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Although alterations and improvements subsequent to occupancy  are not the responsibility of the Corps, the Division or District  Engineer should always review subsequent alteration projects to  determine whether or not the limitations of the Economy Act are  applicable. See AR 415-34, AR 415-35, and AR 420-10 for procedures and  instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Army National Guard. No initial alterations regardless of cost  will be made to properties leased for the Army National Guard without  prior approval of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. (Funds will be made  available by the National Guard Bureau.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Air Force. All alterations to premises leased for the Department  of the Air Force, including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard  Units, are the responsibility of that Department including the issuance  of any Certificate of Necessity for Department of Air Force elements.  The only exception is the leasing and modification of leased premises  for recruiting facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recruiting facilities. The Chief of Engineers, as the Department  of Defense Executive Agent for recruiting facilities, is responsible for  initial alterations for all recruiting facilities located on military  reservations or leased by the Corps. This responsibility includes  recruiting offices and recruiting main stations and detachments, whether  single-service or collocated. However, as to recruiting facilities  acquired by GSA, all alterations are the responsibility of GSA and  processing is accomplished through the Division or District Engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Permanent construction requirements. If permanent construction  is to be placed on land, the Government must have fee title or acquire  title to the land or a permanent easement must be secured, with the  following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government  currently holds the right to reuse by exercise of the National Security  Clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government  holds the right to reuse by exercise of a National Emergency Use  Provision.  Since such rights apply only during the period or periods of national  emergency and are extinguished by the termination thereof, every effort  will be made to negotiate a lease covering   such property under terms that would provide the Government the right of  continuous possession for a minimum of 25 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Real property required for installation of utility lines and  necessary appurtenances thereto, provided a long-term easement or lease  can be secured at a consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Real property required for air bases, provided such property can  be acquired by lease containing provisions for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Right of continuous use by the Government under firm term or  right of renewal for a minimum of 50 years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A rental consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reserving to the Government, title to all improvements to be  placed on the land and the right to dispose of such improvements by sale  or abandonment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Waiver by the lessor of any and all claims for restoration of  the leased premises.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Use of the property for ``Government purposes'' rather than for  a specific military purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Property required for facilities for the Reserve Components of  the Armed Forces, provided such property can be acquired by lease  containing provisions detailed in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.  Whenever possible, the insertion in a lease of a provision restricting  the use of land to a specific purpose will be avoided; use a term such  as ``Government purposes''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Property required for air defense sites, provided such property  can be acquired by lease containing provisions in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii),  (iii), and (iv) of this section and the right of continuous use by the  Government under a firm term or right of renewal for as long as required  for defense purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Assistant Secretary of Defense (MRA&L;) approval is required when  leases for air bases, Reserve Components facilities, or air defense  sites can be obtained containing some but not all of the above listed  provisions. Such approval is also required for leases for all other  types of installations upon which permanent construction is to be placed  by the Government when leases can be obtained containing similar  provisions. In all cases, it must be in the best interest of the  Government to acquire a lesser interest than fee title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Construction projects estimated to cost less than $25,000 will  not be considered a permanent construction for purposes of the above  policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> GSA reimbursement. Reimbursement to GSA for Standard Level User  Charges (SLUC) and other costs incident to leasing will be in accordance  with the applicable provisions of the Federal Property Management  Regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Nominal rent leases. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where premises are occupied by the  Government at a nominal rent or rent-free basis, any alterations,  improvements, and repairs necessary for occupancy may be considered as a  cost of occupancy, i.e., in lieu of rent, for each year of the rental  term. However, the total cost of such alterations, improvements, and  repairs, plus the nominal rental, during any year of the rental term may  not exceed 15 percent of the fair market value at the date of the lease,  unless the total cost plus nominal rental does not exceed $2,000 per  annum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When rental plus amounts to be spent by the Government for  alterations, improvements, and repairs total more than $2,000 and more  than 15 percent of the fair market value of the premises at the date of  the lease, a Certificate of Necessity is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Certificate of Necessity is not required for the cost of  installing equipment, apparatus, appliances, machinery, fixtures,  movable partitions, etc., which are not intended to become an integral  part of the building and which may be removed without injuring or  defacing the item or the building. Such property is considered to be the  property of the Government. The lease or a supplement thereto should  provide for the installation and removal of such equipment, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Under the limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a, not more than 25  percent of the net rental for the original lease period, if less than  one year, may be expended before a lease is actually renewed. If the  whole period, including renewals, is less than a year, not more than 25  percent of the rent for such whole period may be expended for  alterations, repairs, and improvements (20 Comp.   Gen. 30; 29 Comp. Gen. 299). Where a lease, entered into by the  Government for an original term of less than a year, is renewed for the  following fiscal year, the net rental for the first year of the rental  term, as distinguished from the original term, is for consideration in  the computation of the amount that may be paid under the 25 percent  limitation, after the lease is actually renewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Items not within the purview of the Economy Act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a are not applicable to leases of unimproved  land (38 Comp. Gen. 143).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where fixtures, alterations, and improvements are of such  characters to be of a temporary nature, and are not permanently attached  to the realty so as to prevent removal thereof without destroying their  usefulness or damaging them or the realty, they do not constitute  alterations or improvements of the leased premises within the meaning of  40 U.S.C. 278a and therefore do not fall within the 25 percent  limitation of that Act. Title to such temporary fixtures, alterations,  and improvements remains in the Government (18 Comp. Gen. 144; 20 Comp.  Gen. 105).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon termination of leases, restoration of leased premises to  the original condition is not considered an alteration within the  purview of 40 U.S.C. 278a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Government is required by the terms of the lease to  maintain the leased premises, such maintenance, together with the cost  of such improvements and alterations as may be made by the Government,  may not exceed the 25 percent restriction of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Leaseholds acquired through condemnation proceedings are  excluded from the purview of the Act of 30 June 1932, as amended (40  U.S.C. 278a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Architectural Barriers Act. The Architectural Barriers Act of  1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), 82 Stat. 718, 142 U.S.C. 4151, et seq., as  amended, requires that when Federal funding is used in the design,  construction, or alteration of certain buildings or facilities, the  buildings or facilities must be designed, constructed or altered to  insure that physically handicapped persons will have ready access to,  and use of, such buildings. In the Corps' leasing program, when Federal  funds are used to make improvements to leased premises, it is necessary  that the plans and specifications for the construction or alteration  work be approved in accordance with guidelines published by the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), as implemented by DOD Construction  Criteria Manual 4270.1-M, Section 5-1.6.</p>
