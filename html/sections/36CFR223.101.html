                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Contracting Officer shall not award a timber sale contract  unless that officer makes an affirmative determination of purchaser  responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that  the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall  conclude that the prospective purchaser does not qualify as a  responsible purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting  Officer must find that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the  contract or the ability to obtain them;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the  contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and  governmental business commitments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The purchaser has a satisfactory performance record on timber  sale contracts. A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been  seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be  responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the  circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created  through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the  purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply  sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a  contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not a responsible  contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the number of  contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making this  evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and  business ethics;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies  suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection  provisions of the contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an  award under applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the  Contracting Officer determines that the   purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser on an otherwise  acceptable bid, the Contracting Officer shall refer the matter to the  Small Business Administration which will decide whether or not to issue  a Certificate of Competency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Affiliated concerns, as defined in Sec. 223.49(a)(5) of this  subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether  the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable  standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall  consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may  adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.
