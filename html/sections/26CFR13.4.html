                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> will be included in gross income and subject to Federal income  taxation if such obligation is an arbitrage bond. Under section  103(d)(2), an obligation is an arbitrage bond if it is issued by a  governmental unit as part of an issue of obligations (for purposes of  this section referred to as ``governmental obligations'') all or a major  portion of the proceeds of which are (i) reasonably expected to be used  directly or indirectly to acquire certain obligations or securities (for  purposes of this section referred to as ``acquired obligations'') which  may reasonably be expected, at the time of issuance of such governmental  obligations, to produce a yield over the term of the issue of such  governmental obligations which is materially higher (taking into account  any discount or premium) than the yield on such issue, or (ii)  reasonably expected to be used to replace funds which were used directly  or indirectly to acquire such acquired obligations. For rules as to  industrial development bonds, see section 103(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section, the term  ``governmental unit'' means a State, the District of Columbia, a  Territory, or a possession of the United States, or any political  subdivision of any of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``securities'' has the  same meaning as in section 165(g)(2) (A) and (B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Materially higher. For purposes of this section, the yield  produced by acquired obligations is not ``materially higher'' than the  yield produced by an issue of governmental obligations if it is  reasonably expected, at the time of issue of such governmental  obligations, that the adjusted yield (computed in accordance with  subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph) to be produced by the  acquired obligations will not exceed the adjusted yield (computed in  accordance with subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph) to be  produced by the issue of governmental obligations by more than one- eighth of 1 percentage point. In the case of an issue of governmental  obligations issued on or before July 1, 1972, the percentage specified  in the preceding sentence shall be one-half of 1 percentage point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Yield. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section, ``yield'' shall be  computed using the ``interest cost per annum'' method in accordance with  subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph (as the case may be) or  any other method satisfactory to the Commissioner which is consistent  with generally accepted principles of computing yield. In the case of  acquired obligations, the yield to be produced by such obligations shall  be computed as if all acquired obligations comprised a single issue of  obligations. Thus, for example, if the governmental unit acquires two  blocks of Federal obligations, with different interest rates and  maturity periods for each block, the yield on such acquired obligations  shall be computed as if one issue of obligations with different interest  rates and maturity periods had been acquired. The maturity period of  each acquired obligation shall be the period that the governmental unit  reasonably expects to hold such obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If all the governmental or acquired obligations of an issue  have a single interest rate (expressed in dollars per $1,000 of face  amount of bonds), yield shall be computed using the following 4 steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Step (1). Compute the total number of bond years for the issue  by multiplying the number of bonds (treating each $1,000 of face value  as one bond for purposes of this computation) of each maturity by the  length of the maturity period (expressed in years and fractions thereof)  and then adding together the amounts determined for each maturity  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step (2). Compute the total interest payable on the issue by  multiplying the total number of bond years (as computed in step (1)) by  the amount payable, expressed in dollars, as interest on each $1,000 of  bonds for 1 year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Step (3). Compute the net interest in dollars for the issue by  adding the amount, in dollars, of any discount to, or by subtracting the  amount, in dollars, of any premium from, the total interest payable on  the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Step (4). Compute yield by dividing the net interest by the  product obtained by multiplying the total number of bond years for the  issue by 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If governmental or acquired obligations of an issue have  different interest rates (expressed in dollars per $1,000 of face amount  of bonds), yield shall be computed using the following 4 steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Step (1). Compute the total number of bond years for each group  of bonds bearing the same interest rate (treating each $1,000 of face  value as one bond for purposes of this computation) in the manner  described in step 1 of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step (2). Compute the total interest payable on the issue by  multiplying the total number of bond years for each group of bonds  bearing the same interest rate (as computed in step (1)) by the amount  payable, expressed in dollars, as interest on each $1,000 of bonds for 1  year, and then adding together the amounts determined for each group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Step (3). Compute net interest in the manner described in step  (3) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Step (4). Compute the yield produced by the issue in the manner  described in step (4) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of this section, the same method of computing  yield shall be used to compute the yield to be produced by an issue of  governmental obligations and to compute the yield to be produced by  acquired obligations acquired with the proceeds of such issue of  governmental obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The following example illustrates the provisions of this  subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume an issue of $200,000 ($1,000 per bond) with a stated  interest (expressed in dollars per bond) of $50 on bonds maturing in 1,  2, or 3 years, a stated interest of $60 on bonds maturing in 4, 5, 6, or  7 years and a stated interest of $70 on bonds maturing in 8, 9, or 10  years.

State Z uses the net proceeds of the issue of  obligations described in Example (1) to acquire $14,922,000 of student's  notes at par of $1,000 each under a student loan program. The students'  notes will all mature in 10 years, and all have a stated interest of  7\1/2\ percent. Expenses of the program including printing of forms  ($5,000), financial advisors' fees ($11,000), counsel fees ($12,000),  trustees' fees ($5,000), fees for the collecting agents and various  banks which administer the loans ($100,000), advertising expenses  ($10,000), credit reference checks ($20,000), and general office  overhead ($5,000).

Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph,  any obligations which are part of an issue of governmental obligations  the proceeds of which are reasonably expected to be used to finance  certain governmental programs (described in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph) are not arbitrage obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Governmental programs. A governmental program is described in  this subparagraph if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program involves the acquisition of acquired purpose  obligations to carry out the purposes of such program (which  obligations, for purposes of this paragraph, are referred to as  ``acquired program obligations'');</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least 90 percent of all such acquired program obligations,  by amount of cost outstanding, are evidences of loans to a substantial  number of persons representing the general public, loans to exempt  persons within the meaning of section 103(c)(3), or loans to provide  housing and related facilities, or any combination of the foregoing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least 90 percent of all of the amounts received by the  governmental unit with respect to acquired program obligations shall be  used for one or more of the following purposes: To pay the principal or  interest or otherwise to service the debt on governmental obligations  relating to the governmental program; to reimburse the governmental  unit, or to pay, for administrative costs of issuing such governmental  obligations; to reimburse the governmental unit, or to pay, for  administrative and other costs and anticipated future losses directly  related   to the program financed by such governmental obligations; to make  additional loans for the same general purposes specified in such  programs; or to redeem and retire governmental obligations at the next  earliest possible date of redemption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Requires that any person (or any related person, as defined in  section 103(c)(6)(C)) from whom the governmental unit may, under the  program, acquire acquired program obligations shall not, pursuant to an  arrangement, formal or informal, purchase the governmental obligations  in an acquired program obligations to be acquired from such person by  the governmental unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  shall apply only if it is reasonably expected that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A major portion of the proceeds of such issue of governmental  obligations, including proceeds represented by repayments of principal  and interest received by the governmental unit with respect to acquired  program obligations, shall not be invested for more than a temporary  period (within the meaning of section 103(d)(4)(A)), in acquired  obligations (other than acquired program obligations) which produce a  materially higher yield than the yield produced over the term of the  issue by such governmental obligations, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> The adjusted yield (computed in accordance with paragraphs  (a) (4) and (5) of this section) to be produced by acquired program  obligations shall not exceed the adjusted yield (computed in accordance  with paragraphs (a) (4) and (5) of this section) to be produced by such  issue of governmental obligations by more than 1\1/2\ percentage points,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where the difference in the adjusted yields described in  subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph is expected to exceed 1\1/2\  percentage points, the amounts to be obtained as a result of the  difference in such adjusted yields shall not exceed the amount necessary  to pay expenses (including losses resulting from bad debts) reasonably  expected to be incurred as a direct result of administering the program  to be financed with the proceeds of such issue of governmental  obligations, to the extent that such amounts are not payable with funds  appropriated from other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate governmental  programs described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). State A issues obligations the proceeds of which are to  be used to purchase certain home mortgage notes from commercial banks.  The purpose of the governmental program is to encourage the construction  of low income residential housing by creating a secondary market for  mortgage notes and thereby increasing the availability of mortgage money  for low income housing. The legislation provides that the adjusted yield  produced by the mortgage notes to be acquired will not exceed the  adjusted yield produced by such issue of obligations by more than 1\1/2\  percentage points. Amounts received as interest and principal payments  on the mortgage notes are to be used for one or more of the following  purposes: (1) To service the debt on the governmental obligations, (2)  to retire such obligations at their earliest possible date of  redemption, (3) to purchase additional mortgage notes. The governmental  program is one which is described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  and the governmental obligations are not arbitrage bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). State B issues obligations the proceeds of which are to  be used to make loans directly to students and to purchase from  commercial banks promissory notes made by students as the result of  loans made to them by such banks. The legislation authorizing the  student loan program provides that the purpose of the program is to  enable financially disadvantaged students to continue their studies. The  legislation also provides that purchases will be made from banks only  where such banks agree that an amount at least equal to the purchase  price will be devoted to new or additional student loans. It is  reasonably expected that the difference in adjusted yields between the  issue of governmental obligations by State B and the students' notes  will be 1\3/4\ percentage points. It is also reasonably expected that  the amount necessary to pay the expenses (other than expenses taken into  account in computing adjusted yield) enumerated in subparagraph  (3)(ii)(b) of this paragraph, directly incurred as a result of  administering State B's student loan program, such as, for example,  losses resulting from bad debts, insurance costs, bookkeeping expenses,  advertising expenses, credit reference checks, appraisals, title  searches, general office overhead, service fees for collecting agents  and various banks which administer the loans, and salaries of employees  not paid from other sources, will not require a difference in   adjusted yields in excess of 1\1/2\ percentage points. The governmental  program is one which is described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.  Since, however, the difference in adjusted yields produced by the  students' notes and the issue of State B obligations is reasonably  expected to exceed 1\1/2\ percentage points, and since State B cannot  show that 1\3/4\ percentage points is necessary to cover such expenses,  the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply to  the issue of State B obligations. If, however, State B reasonably  expected that 1\3/4\ percentage points would be necessary to cover such  expenses, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph would  apply and the governmental obligations would not be arbitrage bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). Authority C issues obligations the proceeds of which  are to be used to purchase land to be sold to veterans. The governmental  unit will receive purchase-money mortgage notes secured by mortgages on  the land from the veterans in return for such land. The purpose of the  program is to enable veterans to acquire land at reduced cost. The  adjusted yield produced by the mortgage notes is not reasonably expected  to exceed the adjusted yield produced by the issue of obligations issued  by Authority C by more than 1\1/2\ percentage points. Amounts received  as interest and principal payments on the mortgage notes are to be used  for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To pay the administrative  costs directly related to the program, (2) to service the debt on the  governmental obligations, (3) to retire such governmental obligations at  their earliest possible call date, (4) to purchase additional land to be  sold to veterans. The governmental program is one which is described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and the governmental obligations are  not arbitrage bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section will apply with  respect to obligations issued after October 9, 1969, and before final  regulations are promulgated.
