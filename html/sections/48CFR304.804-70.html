In addition, where appropriate, a sample of these contracts or an individual contract may be selected for audit, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting Officers shall request contract closeout audits on physically completed, cost-reimbursement, contracts with for-profit organizations in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OIG and the Associate DAS for Acquisition, in conjunction with the OPDIV's cost advisory/audit focal point, determine which contracts or contractors will be audited, which audit agency will perform the audit, and the type and scope of closeout audit to be performed. These decisions are based on the needs of the customer, risk analysis, return on investment, and the availability of audit resources. When an audit is warranted prior to closing a contract, the Contracting Officer shall submit the audit request to the OIG's Office of Audit Services, through the OPDIV's cost advisory/audit focal point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except where a Contracting Officer suspects misrepresentation or fraud, the Contracting Officer shall not request contract closeout field audits, if the cost of performance is likely to exceed the potential cost recovery. Contracting Officers may close contracts that are not selected for a field audit on the basis of a desk review, subject to any later on-site audit findings. In those situations, the release executed by the contractor shall contain the following statement: ``The Contractor agrees, pursuant to the clause in this contract entitled ``Allowable Cost'' or ``Allowable Cost and Fixed Fee,'' as appropriate, that it will refund to the Government the amount of any sustained audit exceptions resulting from any audit made after final payment.''</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 304.13_Personal Identity Verification</p>
