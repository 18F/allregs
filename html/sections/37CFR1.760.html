                                Sec.  1.760  Interim extension of patent term under 35 U.S.C.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An applicant who has filed a formal application for extension in  compliance with Sec.  1.740 may request one or more interim extensions  for periods of up to one year each pending a final determination on the  application pursuant to Sec.  1.750. Any such request should be filed at  least three months prior to the expiration date of the patent. The  Director may issue interim extensions, without a request by the  applicant, for periods of up to one year each until a final  determination is made. The patent owner or agent will be notified when  an interim extension is granted and notice of the extension will be  published in the Official Gazette of the United States Patent and  Trademark Office. The notice will be recorded in the official file of  the patent and will be considered as part of the original patent. In no  event will the interim extensions granted under this section be longer  than the maximum period for extension to which the applicant would be  eligible.  [65 FR 54680, Sept. 8, 2000]</p>
