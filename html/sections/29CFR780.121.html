                                Sec. 780.121  What constitutes ``raising'' of livestock.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The term ``raising'' employed with reference to livestock in section  3(f) includes such operations as the breeding, fattening, feeding, and  general care of livestock. Thus, employees exclusively engaged in  feeding and fattening livestock in stock pens where the livestock  remains for a substantial period of time are engaged in the ``raising''  of livestock. The fact that the livestock is purchased to be fattened  and is not bred on the premises does not characterize the fattening as  something other than the ``raising'' of livestock. The feeding and care  of livestock does not necessarily or under all circumstances constitute  the ``raising'' of such livestock, however. It is clear, for example,  that animals are not being ``raised'' in the pens of stockyards or the  corrals of meat packing plants where they are confined for a period of a  few days while en route to slaughter or pending their sale or shipment.  Therefore, employees employed in these places in feeding and caring for  the constantly changing group of animals cannot reasonably be regarded  as ``raising'' livestock (NLRB v. Tovrea Packing Co., 111 F. 2d 626,  cert. denied 311 U.S. 668; Walling v. Friend, 156 F. 2d 429). Employees  of a cattle raisers' association engaged in the publication of a  magazine about cattle, the detection of cattle thefts, the location of  stolen cattle, and apprehension of cattle thieves are not employed in  raising livestock and are not engaged in agriculture.</p>
