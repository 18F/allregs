                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each well shall be drilled in conformity with an acceptable  well-spacing program at a surveyed well location approved or prescribed  by the authorized officer after appropriate environmental and technical  reviews (see Sec. 3162.5-1 of this title). An acceptable well-spacing  program may be either (1) one which conforms with a spacing order or  field rule issued by a State Commission or Board and accepted by the  authorized officer, or (2) one which is located on a lease committed to  a communitized or unitized tract at a location approved by the  authorized officer, or (3) any other program established by the  authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any well drilled on restricted Indian land shall be subject to  the location restrictions specified in the lease and/or Title 25 of the  CFR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The operator shall submit to the authorized officer for approval  an Application for Permit to Drill for each well. No drilling  operations, nor surface disturbance preliminary thereto, may be  commenced prior to the authorized officer's approval of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Application for Permit to Drill process shall be initiated  at least 30 days before commencement of operations is desired. Prior to  approval, the application shall be administratively and technically  complete. A complete application consists of Form 3160-3 and the  following attachments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A drilling plan, which may already be on file, containing  information required by paragraph (e) of this section and appropriate  orders and notices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A surface use plan of operations containing information required  by paragraph (f) of this section and appropriate orders and notices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of bond coverage as required by the Department of the  Interior regulations, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such other information as may be required by applicable orders  and notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each drilling plan shall contain the information specified in  applicable notices or orders, including a description of the drilling  program, the surface and projected completion zone location, pertinent  geologic data, expected hazards, and proposed mitigation measures to  address such hazards. A drilling plan may be submitted for a single well  or for several wells proposed to be drilled to the same zone within a  field or area of geological and environmental similarity. A drilling  plan may be modified from time to time as circumstances may warrant,   with the approval of the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The surface use plan of operations shall contain information  specified in applicable orders or notices, including the road and  drillpad location, details of pad construction, methods for containment  and disposal of waste material, plans for reclamation of the surface,  and other pertinent data as the authorized officer may require. A  surface use plan of operations may be submitted for a single well or for  several wells proposed to be drilled in an area of environmental  similarity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For Federal lands, upon receipt of the Application for Permit to  Drill or Notice of Staking, the authorized officer shall post the  following information for public inspection at least 30 days before  action to approve the Application for Permit to Drill: the company/ operator name; the well name/number; the well location described to the  nearest quarter-quarter section (40 acres), or similar land description  in the case of lands described by metes and bounds, or maps showing the  affected lands and the location of all tracts to be leased and of all  leases already issued in the general area; and any substantial  modifications to the lease terms. Where the inclusion of maps in such  posting is not practicable, maps of the affected lands shall be made  available to the public for review. This information also shall be  provided promptly by the authorized officer to the appropriate office of  the Federal surface management agency, for lands the surface of which is  not under Bureau jurisdiction, requesting such agency to post the  proposed action for public inspection for at least 30 days. The posting  shall be in the office of the authorized officer and in the appropriate  surface managing agency if other than the Bureau. The posting of an  Application for Permit to Drill is for information purposes only and is  not an appealable decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Upon initiation of the Application for Permit to Drill process,  the authorized officer shall consult with the appropriate Federal  surface management agency and with other interested parties as  appropriate and shall take one of the following actions as soon as  practical, but in no event later than 5 working days after the  conclusion of the 30-day notice period for Federal lands, or within 30  days from receipt of the application for Indian lands:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approve the application as submitted or with appropriate  modifications or conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Return the application and advise the applicant of the reasons  for disapproval; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advise the applicant, either in writing or orally with  subsequent written confirmation, of the reasons why final action will be  delayed along with the date such final action can be expected.  The surface use plan of operations for National Forest System lands  shall be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture or his/her  representative prior to approval of the Application for Permit to Drill  by the authorized officer. Appeals from the denial of approval of such  surface use plan of operations shall be submitted to the Secretary of  Agriculture.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Approval of the Application for Permit to Drill does not warrant  or certify that the applicant holds legal or equitable title to the  subject lease(s) which would entitle the applicant to conduct drilling  operations.
