                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> or (b) of section 6 (whichever may be applicable).'' The  word ``regular'' describing the rate in this provision is not to be  treated as surplusage. To understand the nature of this requirement it  is important to consider the past history of this type of agreement in  the courts. In both of the two cases before it, the Supreme Court found  that the relationship between the hourly rate specified in the contract  and the amount guaranteed was such that the employee in a substantial  portion of the workweeks of the period examined by the court worked  sufficient hours to earn in excess of the guaranteed amount and in those  workweeks was paid at the specified hourly rate for the first 40 hours  and at time and one-half such rate for hours in excess of 40 (Walling v.  A. H. Belo Company, 316 U.S. 624, and Walling v. Halliburton Oil Well  Cementing Company, 331 U.S.17). The fact that section 7(f) requires that  a contract, to qualify an employee for exemption under section 7(f),  must specify a ``regular rate,'' indicates that this criterion of these  two cases is still important.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regular rate of pay specified in the contract may not be  less than the applicable minimum rate. There is no requirement, however,  that the regular rate specified be equal to the regular rate at which  the employee was formerly employed before the contract was entered into.  The specified regular rate may be any amount (at least the applicable  minimum wage) which the parties agree to and which can reasonably be  expected to be operative in controlling the employee's compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rate specified in the contract must also be a ``regular''  rate which is operative in determining the total amount of the  employee's compensation. Suppose, for example, that the compensation of  an employee is normally made up in part by regular bonuses, commissions,  or the like. In the past he has been employed at an hourly rate of $5  per hour in addition to which he has received a cost-of-living bonus of  $7 a week and a 2-percent commission on sales which averaged $70 per  week. It is now proposed to employ him under a guaranteed pay contract  which specifies a rate of $5 per hour and guarantees $200 per week, but  he will continue to receive his cost-of-living bonus and commissions in  addition to the guaranteed pay. Bonuses and commissions of this type  are, of course, included in the ``regular rate'' as defined in section  7(e). It is also apparent that the $5 rate specified in the contract is  not a ``regular rate'' under the requirements of section 7(f) since it  never controls or determines the total compensation he receives. For  this reason, it is not possible to enter into a guaranteed pay agreement  of the type permitted under section 7(f) with an employee whose regular  weekly earnings are made up in part by the payment of regular bonuses  and commissions of this type. This is so because even in weeks in which  the employee works sufficient hours to exceed, at his hourly rate, the  sum guaranteed, his total compensation is controlled by the bonus and  the amount of commissions earned as well as by the hourly rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In order to qualify as a ``regular rate'' under section 7(f) the  rate specified in the contract together with the   guarantee must be the actual measure of the regular wages which the  employee receives. However, the payment of extra compensation, over and  above the guaranteed amount, by way of extra premiums for work on  holidays, or for extraordinarily excessive work (such as for work in  excess of 16 consecutive hours in a day, or for work in excess of 6  consecutive days of work), year-end bonuses and similar payments which  are not regularly paid as part of the employee's usual wages, will not  invalidate a contract which otherwise qualifies under section 7(f).
