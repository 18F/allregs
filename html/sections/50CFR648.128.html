                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Party/Charter and recreational possession limits. No person  shall possess more than 50 scup in, or harvested from, per trip the EEZ  unless that person is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel issued a  scup moratorium permit, or is issued a scup dealer permit. Persons  aboard a commercial vessel that is not eligible for a scup moratorium  permit are subject to this possession limit. The owner, operator, and  crew of a charter or party boat issued a scup moratorium permit are  subject to the possession limit when carrying passengers for hire or  when carrying more than five crew members for a party boat, or more than  three crew members for a charter boat. This possession limit may be  adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.122.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If whole scup are processed into fillets, an authorized officer  will convert the number of fillets to whole scup at the place of landing  by dividing fillet number by 2. If scup are filleted into a single  (butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be deemed to be from one whole  scup.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scup harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit with  more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers.  Compliance with the possession limit will be determined by dividing the  number of scup on board by the number of persons aboard other than the  captain and crew. If there is a violation of the possession limit on  board a vessel carrying more than one person, the violation shall be  deemed to have been committed by the owner and operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Scup and scup parts harvested by a vessel with a moratorium or  charter or party boat scup permit, or in or from the EEZ north of  3515.3 N. lat., may not be landed with the skin removed.
