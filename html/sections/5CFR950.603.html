                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may impose sanctions or penalties on a  federation, charitable organization or PCFO for violating these  regulations, other applicable provisions of law, or any directive or  instruction from the Director. The Director will determine the  appropriate sanction and/or penalty, up to and including expulsion from  the CFC. In determining the appropriate sanction and/or penalty, the  Director will consider previous violations, harm to Federal employee  confidence in the CFC, and any other relevant factors. The Director may  bar a federation or charitable organization from serving as PCFO, for a  period not to exceed one campaign period, if it is determined that that  the federation or charitable organization has violated any provisions of  these regulations. A federation, charitable organization or PCFO will be  notified in writing of the Director's intent to sanction and/or penalize  and will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of the notice to  submit a written response. The Director's final   decision will be communicated in writing to the federation, charitable  organization, or PCFO, with a copy to the appropriate LFCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director may withdraw federation status with respect to a  national, international or local federation that makes a false  certification or fails to comply with any directive of the Director, or  to respond in a timely fashion to a request by the Director or LFCC for  information or cooperation, including with respect to an investigation  or in the settlement of disbursements. The LFCC may recommend the  withdrawal of federation status with respect to a local federation. As  stated in Sec. Sec. 950.301(d) and 950.303(d), failure to meet minimum  federation eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a  withdrawal of federation status subject to a hearing on the record.  Eligibility decisions shall follow the procedures in Sec. Sec.  950.301(f) and 950.303(f). A federation will be notified in writing of  the Director's intent to withdraw federation status for a period of up  to one campaign period and will have 10 business days from the date of  receipt of the notice to submit a written response. On receipt of the  response, or in the absence of a timely response, the Director or  representative shall set a date, time, and place for a hearing. The  federation shall be notified at least 10 business days in advance of the  hearing. A hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by  the Director unless it is waived in writing by the federation. After the  hearing is held, or after the Director's receipt of the federation's  written waiver of the hearing, the Director shall make a final decision  on the record, taking into consideration the recommendation submitted by  the hearing officer. The Director's final decision will be communicated  in writing to the federation, with a copy to the appropriate LFCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A federation, charitable organization or PCFO sanctioned or  penalized under any provision of these regulations must demonstrate to  the satisfaction of the Director that it has taken corrective action to  resolve the reason for sanction and/or penalty and has implemented  reasonable and appropriate controls to ensure that the situation will  not occur again prior to being allowed to participate in subsequent CFCs  and/or serving as a PCFO for a campaign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the Director's discretion, PCFO's and Federations may be  directed to suspend distribution of current and future CFC donations  from Federal employees to recipient organizations. Federations and  PCFO's shall immediately place suspended contributions in an interest  bearing account until directed to do otherwise.
