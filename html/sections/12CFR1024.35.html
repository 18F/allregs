                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notice of error. A servicer shall comply with the requirements of this section for any written notice from the borrower that asserts an error and that includes the name of the borrower, information that enables the servicer to identify the borrower's mortgage loan account, and the error the borrower believes has occurred. A notice on a payment coupon or other payment form supplied by the servicer need not be treated by the servicer as a notice of error. A qualified written request that asserts an error relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan is a notice of error for purposes of this section, and a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a notice of error with respect to such qualified written request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope of error resolution. For purposes of this section, the term ``error'' refers to the following categories of covered errors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Failure to accept a payment that conforms to the servicer's written requirements for the borrower to follow in making payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to apply an accepted payment to principal, interest, escrow, or other charges under the terms of the mortgage loan and applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt in violation of 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to pay taxes, insurance premiums, or other charges, including charges that the borrower and servicer have voluntarily agreed that the servicer should collect and pay, in a timely manner as required by Sec. 1024.34(a), or to refund an escrow account balance as required by Sec. 1024.34(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Imposition of a fee or charge that the servicer lacks a reasonable basis to impose upon the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Failure to provide an accurate payoff balance amount upon a borrower's request in violation of section 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure to provide accurate information to a borrower regarding loss mitigation options and foreclosure, as required by Sec. 1024.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Failure to transfer accurately and timely information relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan account to a transferee servicer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process in violation of Sec. 1024.41(f) or (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Moving for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conducting a foreclosure sale in violation of Sec. 1024.41(g) or (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Any other error relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contact information for borrowers to assert errors. A servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit a notice of error in accordance with the procedures in this section. The notice shall include a statement that the borrower must use the established address to assert an error. If a servicer designates a specific address for receiving notices of error, the servicer shall designate the same address for receiving information requests pursuant to Sec. 1024.36(b). A servicer shall provide a written notice to a borrower before any change in the address used for receiving a notice of error. A servicer that designates an address for receipt of notices of error must post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the Web site lists any contact address for the servicer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acknowledgment of receipt. Within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of a servicer receiving a notice of error from a borrower, the servicer shall provide to the borrower a written response

acknowledging receipt of the notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Response to notice of error--(1) Investigation and response requirements--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a servicer must respond to a notice of error by either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Correcting the error or errors identified by the borrower and providing the borrower with a written notification of the correction, the effective date of the correction, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conducting a reasonable investigation and providing the borrower with a written notification that includes a statement that the servicer has determined that no error occurred, a statement of the reason or reasons for this determination, a statement of the borrower's right to request documents relied upon by the servicer in reaching its determination, information regarding how the borrower can request such documents, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Different or additional error. If during a reasonable investigation of a notice of error, a servicer concludes that errors occurred other than, or in addition to, the error or errors alleged by the borrower, the servicer shall correct all such additional errors and provide the borrower with a written notification that describes the errors the servicer identified, the action taken to correct the errors, the effective date of the correction, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requesting information from borrower. A servicer may request supporting documentation from a borrower in connection with the investigation of an asserted error, but may not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Require a borrower to provide such information as a condition of investigating an asserted error; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine that no error occurred because the borrower failed to provide any requested information without conducting a reasonable investigation pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time limits--(i) In general. A servicer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Not later than seven days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error for errors asserted under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prior to the date of a foreclosure sale or within 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error, whichever is earlier, for errors asserted under paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For all other asserted errors, not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the applicable notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extension of time limit. For asserted errors governed by the time limit set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section, a servicer may extend the time period for responding by an additional 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) if, before the end of the 30-day period, the servicer notifies the borrower of the extension and the reasons for the extension in writing. A servicer may not extend the time period for responding to errors asserted under paragraph (b)(6), (9), or (10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Copies of documentation. A servicer shall provide to the borrower, at no charge, copies of documents and information relied upon by the servicer in making its determination that no error occurred within 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receiving the borrower's request for such documents. A servicer is not required to provide documents relied upon that constitute confidential, proprietary or privileged information. If a servicer withholds documents relied upon because it has determined that such documents constitute confidential, proprietary or privileged information, the servicer must notify the borrower of its determination in writing within 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receipt of the borrower's request for such documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Alternative compliance--(1) Early correction. A servicer is not required to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of

this section if the servicer corrects the error or errors asserted by the borrower and notifies the borrower of that correction in writing within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receiving the notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Error asserted before foreclosure sale. A servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for errors asserted under paragraph (b)(9) or (10) of this section if the servicer receives the applicable notice of an error seven or fewer days before a foreclosure sale. For any such notice of error, a servicer shall make a good faith attempt to respond to the borrower, orally or in writing, and either correct the error or state the reason the servicer has determined that no error has occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Requirements not applicable--(1) In general. A servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (i) of this section if the servicer reasonably determines that any of the following apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duplicative notice of error. The asserted error is substantially the same as an error previously asserted by the borrower for which the servicer has previously complied with its obligation to respond pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, unless the borrower provides new and material information to support the asserted error. New and material information means information that was not reviewed by the servicer in connection with investigating a prior notice of the same error and is reasonably likely to change the servicer's prior determination about the error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overbroad notice of error. The notice of error is overbroad. A notice of error is overbroad if the servicer cannot reasonably determine from the notice of error the specific error that the borrower asserts has occurred on a borrower's account. To the extent a servicer can reasonably identify a valid assertion of an error in a notice of error that is otherwise overbroad, the servicer shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e) and (i) of this section with respect to that asserted error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Untimely notice of error. A notice of error is delivered to the servicer more than one year after:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Servicing for the mortgage loan that is the subject of the asserted error was transferred from the servicer receiving the notice of error to a transferee servicer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The mortgage loan is discharged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice to borrower. If a servicer determines that, pursuant to this paragraph (g), the servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (i) of this section, the servicer shall notify the borrower of its determination in writing not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after making such determination. The notice to the borrower shall set forth the basis under paragraph (g)(1) of this section upon which the servicer has made such determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payment requirements prohibited. A servicer shall not charge a fee, or require a borrower to make any payment that may be owed on a borrower's account, as a condition of responding to a notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effect on servicer remedies--(1) Adverse information. After receipt of a notice of error, a servicer may not, for 60 days, furnish adverse information to any consumer reporting agency regarding any payment that is the subject of the notice of error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remedies permitted. Except as set forth in this section with respect to an assertion of error under paragraph (b)(9) or (10) of this section, nothing in this section shall limit or restrict a lender or servicer from pursuing any remedy it has under applicable law, including initiating foreclosure or proceeding with a foreclosure sale.
