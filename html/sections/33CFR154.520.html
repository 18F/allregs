Such hoses and/or loading arms must be blanked off during the transfer of oil or hazardous material. A suitable material in the joints and couplings shall be installed on each end of the hose assembly or loading arm not being used for transfer to ensure a leak-free seal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A new, unused hose, and a hose that has been cleaned and is gas free, is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
