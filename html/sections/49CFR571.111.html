                            <p class="depth0">S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for rear visibility devices and systems.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries that occur when the driver of a motor vehicle does not have a clear and reasonably unobstructed view to the rear.</p><p class="depth0">S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, school buses, motorcycles and low-speed vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">S4. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Backing event means an amount of time which starts when the vehicle's direction selector is placed in reverse, and ends at the manufacturer's choosing, when the vehicle forward motion reaches:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> a speed of 10 mph,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> a distance of 10 meters traveled, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> a continuous duration of 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth0">Convex mirror means a mirror having a curved reflective surface whose shape is the same as that of the exterior surface of a section of a sphere.</p><p class="depth0">Effective mirror surface means the portions of a mirror that reflect images, excluding the mirror rim or mounting brackets.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental test fixture means a device designed to support the external components of the rear visibility system for testing purposes, using any factory seal which would be used during normal vehicle operation, in a manner that simulates the on-vehicle component orientation during normal vehicle operation, and prevents the exposure of any test conditions to portions of the external component which are not exposed to the outside of the motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">External component means any part of the rear visibility system which is exposed to the outside of the motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Key means a physical device or an electronic code which, when inserted into the starting system (by physical or electronic means), enables the vehicle operator to activate the engine or motor.</p><p class="depth0">Limited line manufacturer means a manufacturer that sells three or fewer carlines, as that term is defined in 49 CFR 583.4, in the United States during a production year, as that term is defined in S15.</p><p class="depth0">Rearview image means a visual image, detected by means of a single source, of the area directly behind a vehicle that is provided in a single location to the vehicle operator and by means of indirect vision.</p><p class="depth0">Rear visibility system means the set of devices or components which together perform the function of producing the rearview image as required under this standard.</p><p class="depth0">Small manufacturer means an original vehicle manufacturer that produces or assembles fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Starting system means the vehicle system used in conjunction with the key to activate the engine or motor.</p><p class="depth0">Unit magnification mirror means a plane or flat mirror with a reflective surface through which the angular height and width of the image of an object is equal to the angular height and width of the object when viewed directly at the same distance except for flaws that do not exceed normal manufacturing tolerances. For the purposes of this regulation a prismatic day-night adjustment rearview mirror one of whose positions provides unit magnification is considered a unit magnification mirror.</p><p class="depth0">S5. Requirements for passenger cars.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Inside rearview mirror.

The line of sight may be partially obscured by seated occupants or by head restraints. The location of the driver's eye reference points

shall be those established in Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 104 (Sec. 571.104) or a nominal location appropriate for any 95th percentile male driver.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1.2 Mounting.

Determination of radius of curvature.</p><p class="depth0">S12.1 To determine the average radius of curvature of a convex mirror, use a 3-point linear spherometer, which meets the requirements of S12.2, at the 10 test positions shown in Figure 1 and record the readings for each position.</p><p class="depth0">S12.2 The 3-point linear spherometer has two outer fixed legs 38 mm apart and one inner movable leg at the midpoint. The spherometer has a dial indicator with a scale that can be read accurately to .0025 mm, with the zero reading being a flat surface.</p><p class="depth0">S12.3 The 10 test positions on the image display consist of two positions at right angles to each other at each of five locations as shown in Figure 1. The locations are at the center of the mirror, at the left and right ends of a horizontal line that bisects the mirror and at the top and bottom ends of a vertical line that bisects the mirror. None of the readings are within a 6.4 mm border on the edge of the image display.</p><p class="depth0">S12.4 At each position, the spherometer is held perpendicular to the convex mirror-surface and a record is made of the reading on the dial indicator to the nearest .0025 mm.</p><p class="depth0">S12.5 Convert the dial reading data for each of the 10 test positions to radius of curvature calculations using Table I. Consider the change as linear for dial readings that fall between two numbers in Table I.</p><p class="depth0">S12.6 Calculate the average radius of curvature by adding all 10 radius of curvature calculations and dividing by ten.</p><p class="depth0">S12.7 Determine the numerical difference between the average radius of curvature and each of the 10 individual radius of curvature calculations determined in S12.5.</p><p class="depth0">S12.8 Calculate the greatest percentage deviation by dividing the greatest numerical difference determined in S12.7 by the average radius of curvature and multiply by 100.
