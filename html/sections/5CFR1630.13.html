                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals who disagree with the refusal to grant them access  to or to amend a record about them should submit a written request for  review to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment  Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The words  ``PRIVACY ACT--APPEAL'' should be written on the letter and the  envelope. Individuals who need assistance preparing their appeal should  contact the Board's Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The appeal letter must be received by the Board within 30  calendar days from the date the requester received the notice of denial.  At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The records involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of  the record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of the Board's denial of that request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reasons supporting the request for reversal of the Board's  decision.  Copies of previous correspondence from the Board denying the request to  access or amend the record should also be attached, if possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board reserves the right to dispose of correspondence  concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for  review of the Board's decision is received within 180 days of the  decision date. Therefore, a request for review received after 180 days  may, at the discretion of the Privacy Act Officer, be treated as an  initial request to access or amend a record.
