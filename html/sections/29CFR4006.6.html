                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. For purposes of this part and part 4007 of this  chapter, an individual is considered to be a participant in a plan on  any date if the plan has benefit liabilities with respect to the  individual on that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loss or distribution of benefit. For purposes of this section,  an individual is treated as no longer being a participant--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an individual with no vested accrued benefit,  after--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual incurs a one-year break in service under the  terms of the plan,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual's entire ``zero-dollar'' vested accrued benefit  is deemed distributed under the terms of the plan, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual dies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a living individual whose accrued benefit is  fully or partially vested, or a deceased individual whose accrued  benefit was fully or partially vested at the time of death, after--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An insurer makes an irrevocable commitment to pay all benefit  liabilities with respect to the individual, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All benefit liabilities with respect to the individual are  otherwise distributed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The operation of this section is illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Participation under a calendar-year plan begins upon  commencement of employment, and the only benefit provided by the plan is  an accrued benefit (expressed as a life annuity beginning at age 65) of  $30 per month times full years of service. The plan credits a ratable  portion of a full year of service for service of at least 1,000 hours  but less than 2,000 hours in a service computation period that begins on  the date when the participant commences employment and each anniversary  of that date. John and Mary both commence employment on July 1, 2008. On  December 31, 2008 (the participant count date for the plan's 2009  premium), John has credit for 988 hours of service and Mary has credit  for 1,006 hours of service. For purposes of this section, Mary is  considered to have an accrued benefit, and John is considered not to  have an accrued benefit. Thus, the plan is considered to have benefit  liabilities with respect to Mary, but not John, on December 31, 2008;  and Mary, but not John, must be counted as a participant for purposes of  computing the plan's 2009 premium.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The plan also provides that a participant becomes vested  five years after commencing employment and defines a one-year break in  service as a service computation period in which less than 500 hours of  service is performed. On February 1, 2010, John has an accrued benefit  of $18 per month beginning at age 65 based on credit for 1,200 hours of  service in the service computation period that began July 1, 2008.  However, John has credit for only 492 hours of service in the service  computation period that began July 1, 2009. On February 1, 2010, John  terminates his employment. On December 31, 2010 (the participant count  date for the 2011 premium), John has incurred a one-year break in  service, and thus is not counted as a participant for purposes of  computing the plan's 2011 premium.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. On January 1, 2012, the plan is amended to provide that  if a vested participant whose accrued benefit has a present value of  $5,000 or less leaves employment, the benefit will be immediately cashed  out. On December 30, 2013, Jane, who has a vested benefit with a present  value of less than $5,000, leaves employment. Because of reasonable  administrative delay in determining the amount of the benefit to be  paid, the plan does not pay Jane the value of her benefit until January  9, 2014. Under the provisions of this section, Jane is treated as not  having an accrued benefit on December 31, 2013 (the participant count  date for the 2014 premium), because Jane's benefit is treated as having  been paid on December 30, 2013. Thus, Jane is not counted as a  participant for purposes of computing the plan's 2014 premium.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. If the plan amendment had instead provided for cashouts  as of the first of the month following termination of employment, and  the plan paid Jane the value of her benefit on January 1, 2014, Jane  would be treated under the provisions of this section as having an  accrued benefit on December 31, 2013, and would thus be counted as a  participant for purposes of computing the plan's 2014 premium.
