                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section applies where benefits are not already  in pay status. Except as provided in Sec. 4022.7 (relating to the  payment of lump sums), the PBGC will pay benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the automatic PBGC form described in paragraph (b) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an optional PBGC form described in paragraph (c) of this  section is elected, in that optional form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automatic PBGC form--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participants. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Married participants.  The automatic PBGC form with respect to a participant who is married at  the time the benefit enters pay status is the form a married participant  would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an  election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unmarried participants. The automatic PBGC form with respect to  a participant who is unmarried at the time the benefit enters pay status  is the form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from the  plan in the absence of an election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beneficiaries. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> QPSA beneficiaries. The automatic PBGC form  with respect to the spouse of a married participant in a plan with a  termination date on or after August 23, 1984, who dies before his or her  benefit enters pay status is the qualified preretirement survivor  annuity such a spouse would be entitled to receive from the plan in the  absence of an election. The PBGC will not charge the participant or  beneficiary for this survivor benefit coverage for the time period  beginning on the plan's termination date (regardless of whether the plan  would have charged).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternate payees. The automatic PBGC form with respect to an  alternate payee with a separate interest under a qualified domestic  relations order is the form an unmarried participant would be entitled  to receive from the plan in the absence of an election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional PBGC forms--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participant and beneficiary elections.  A participant may elect any optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4)  or (c)(5) of this section. A beneficiary described in paragraph (b)(2)  of this section (a QPSA beneficiary or an alternate payee) may elect any  optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iv) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permitted designees. A participant or beneficiary, whether  married or unmarried, who elects an optional form with a survivor  feature (e.g., a 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity or, in the case  of a participant, a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) may designate either  a spouse or a non-spouse beneficiary to receive survivor benefits. An  optional joint-life form must be payable to a natural person or (with  the consent of the PBGC) to a trust for the benefit of one or more  natural persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spousal consent. In the case of a participant who is married at  the time the benefit enters pay status, the election of an optional form  or the designation of a non-spouse beneficiary is valid only if the  participant's spouse consents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Permitted optional single-life forms. The PBGC may offer  benefits in the following single-life forms:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A straight-life annuity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A 10-year certain-and-continuous annuity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A 15-year certain-and-continuous annuity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from  the plan in the absence of an election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Permitted optional joint-life forms. The PBGC may offer benefits  in the following joint-life forms:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A joint-and-50%-survivor annuity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A joint-and-50%-survivor-``pop-up'' annuity (i.e., where the  participant's benefit ``pops up'' to the unreduced level if the  beneficiary dies first);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A joint-and-75%-survivor annuity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A joint-and-100%-survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Determination of benefit amount; starting benefit. To determine  the amount of the benefit in an optional PBGC form--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Single-life forms. In the case of an optional PBGC form under  paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the  amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to an unmarried  participant in the absence of an election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Joint-life forms. In the case of an optional PBGC form under  paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the  amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to a married  participant in the absence of an election. For this purpose, the PBGC  will treat a participant who designates a non-spouse beneficiary as  being married to a person who is the same age as that non-spouse  beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Determination of benefit amount; conversion factors. The PBGC  will convert the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(6) of  this section to the optional form elected, using PBGC factors based on--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mortality. Unisex mortality rates that are a fixed blend of 50  percent of the male mortality rates and 50 percent of the female  mortality rates from the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table as  prescribed in Rev. Rul. 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80 (Internal Revenue Service  Cumulative Bulletins are available from the Superintendent of Documents,  Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interest. An interest rate of six percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Determination of benefit amount; limitation. The PBGC will limit  the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(7) of this section to  the amount of the benefit it would pay in the form of a straight life  annuity under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Incidental benefits. The PBGC will not pay an optional PBGC form  with a death benefit (e.g., a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) unless the  death benefit would be an ``incidental death benefit'' under 26 CFR  1.401-1(b)(1)(i). If the death benefit would not be an ``incidental  death benefit,'' the PBGC may instead offer a modified version of the  optional form under which the death benefit would be an ``incidental  death benefit.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change in benefit form. Once payment of a benefit starts, the  benefit form cannot be changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> PBGC discretion. The PBGC may make other optional annuity forms  available subject to the rules in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rollover amounts. The annuity benefit resulting from rollover  amounts (as determined under Sec. 4044.12(c)(4) of this chapter) is  combined with any other benefit under the plan and paid in the same form  and at the same time as the other benefit.
