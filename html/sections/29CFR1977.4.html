                            <p class="depth0">Section 11(c) specifically states that ``no person shall discharge  or in any manner discriminate against any employee'' because the  employee has exercised rights under the Act. Section 3(4) of the Act  defines ``person'' as ``one or more individuals, partnerships,  associations, corporations, business trusts, legal representatives, or  any group of persons.'' Consequently, the prohibitions of section 11(c)  are not limited to actions taken by employers against their own  employees. A person may be chargeable with discriminatory action against  an employee of another person. Section 11(c) would extend to such  entities as organizations representing employees for collective  bargaining purposes, employment agencies, or any other person in a  position to discriminate against an employee. See, Meek v. United  States, 136 F. 2d 679 (6th Cir., 1943); Bowe v. Judson C. Burns, 137 F.  2d 37 (3rd Cir., 1943).</p>
