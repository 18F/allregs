                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of section 44 and the regulations thereunder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> New principal residence. The term ``new principal residence''  means a principal residence, the original use of which commences with  the taxpayer. The term ``principal residence'' has the same meaning as  under section 1034 of the Code. For this purpose, the term ``residence''  includes, without being limited to, a single family structure, a  residential unit in a condominium or cooperative housing project, a  townhouse, and a factory-made home. In the case of a tenant-stockholder  in a cooperative housing corporation references to property used by the  taxpayer as his principal residence and references to the residence of a  taxpayer shall include stock held by the tenant-stockholder in a  cooperative housing project provided, however, that the taxpayer used as  his principal residence the house or apartment which he was entitled as  such stockholder to occupy. ``Original use'' of the new principal  residence by the taxpayer means that such residence has never been used  as a residence prior to its use as such by the taxpayer. For this  purpose, a residence will qualify if the first occupancy was by the  taxpayer pursuant to a lease arrangement pending settlement under a  binding contract to purchase or pursuant to a lease arrangement where a  written option to purchase the then existing residence was contained in  the original lease agreement.  A renovated building does not qualify as new, regardless of the extent  of the renovation nor does a condominium conversion qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Purchase price--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of section 44(a)  and Sec.  1.44-1, the term ``purchase price'' means the adjusted basis  of the new principal residence on the date of acquisition and includes  all amounts attributable to the acquisition or construction, but only to  the extent that such amounts constitute capital expenditures and are not  allowable as deductions in computing taxable income. Such capital   expenditures include but are not limited to the cost of acquisition or  construction, title insurance, attorney's fees, transfer taxes, and  other costs of transfer. For these purposes the adjusted basis of a  factory-made home includes the cost of moving the home and setting it up  as the taxpayer's principal residence only where such cost is included  in the base price of the residence; it also includes the purchase price  of the land on which the home is located, but only if such land was  purchased by the taxpayer after March 12, 1975 and only if the taxpayer  acquired the land prior to or in conjunction with the acquisition of  such factory-made home. However, the adjusted basis does not include any  expenditures involved in connection with the leasing of land on which  the factory-made home is located. In the case of factory-made homes the  adjusted basis includes furniture only where it is included in the base  price of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sale of old principal residence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted basis is  reduced by any gain from the sale or involuntary conversion of an old  principal residence, which is not recognized due to the application of  section 1033 or section 1034. However, no reduction will be made for any  gain excluded from tax by reason of the special treatment provided under  the tax laws in the case of a sale by a taxpayer who has attained age 65  (section 121 of the code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A sells an old principal residence for $30,000 which has  an adjusted basis of $20,000. A reinvests the proceeds by purchasing a  new principal residence for $40,000 (including settlement costs which  are capital in nature), and this purchase satisfies the statutory  criteria under section 1034 for nonrecognition of gain. The credit under  section 44 applies with respect to $30,000 ($40,000 costs minus $10,000  unrecognized gain) of the cost of the new principal residence.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B and C, two sisters, purchase a new principal residence  as joint tenants with the right of survivorship for a total purchase  price of $40,000. B has previously sold her old principal residence for  $25,000 and a $10,000 gain on the sale has qualified for nonrecognition  under section 1034. B contributes $25,000 and C contributes $15,000. The  adjusted basis of the new principal residence is $30,000 representing  the total purchase price of $40,000 less $10,000 representing  unrecognized gain under section 1034. The total credit allowable,  therefore, is $1,500. Since joint tenants are treated as equal owners  and since allocation of the credit is made in proportion to the  taxpayer's respective ownership interests in such residence B and C each  will receive a credit of $750.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Taxpayer D is 65 years old and sells his old principal  residence for $20,000 excluding all gain under section 121. He then  purchases a new principal residence for $30,000. D's adjusted basis in  his new principal residence is $30,000, and he is allowed a credit of  $1,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tie-in sales. In the case of a purchase of a new principal  residence which is tied in to the transfer of other property by the  seller to the purchaser, whether purportedly by sale or gift, the  adjusted basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the excess  of the fair market value of such other property received over the  amount, if any, purportedly paid for it by the purchaser of the  residence. For example, if a taxpayer receives a new car with a fair  market value of $2,500 upon the purchase of a condominium apartment for  a total purchase price of $40,000 (including settlement costs which are  capital in nature) his adjusted basis in the residence for computation  of the credit is $37,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Basis of new principal residence. The taxpayer's basis in his  new principal residence is not in any way affected by the allowance of  the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Purchase--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph, the term ``purchase'' means any acquisition of  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An acquisition does not qualify as a purchase  for the purpose of this paragraph if the property is acquired from a  person whose relationship to the person acquiring it would result in the  disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b). Such persons  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The purchaser's spouse, ancestors and lineal descendants,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Related corporations as provided under section 267(b)(2),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Related trusts as provided under section 267(b), (4), (5), (6),  and (7),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Related charitable organizations as provided under section  267(b)(9), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Related partnerships as provided under section 707(b)(1).    For purposes of this subdivision the constructive ownership rules of  section 267(c) shall apply except that paragraph (4) of section 267(c)  shall be treated as providing that the family of an individual shall  include only his spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An acquisition does not qualify as a purchase for the purpose  of this paragraph if the basis of the property in the hands of the  person acquiring such property is determined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such  property in the hands of the person from whom acquired (e.g., a gift  under section 1015), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under section 1014(a) (relating to property acquired from a  decedent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Self-construction. The term ``self-construction'' means the  construction of a residence (other than a factory-made home) to the  taxpayer's specifications on land already owned or leased by the  taxpayer at the time of commencement of construction. Thus, where a  taxpayer purchases land and either builds a residence himself or hires  an architect and a contractor to build a residence on that land, the  taxpayer has ``self-constructed'' the residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Factory-made home. The term ``factory-made homes'' includes  mobile homes, houseboats and prefabricated and modular homes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Lowest offer. The term ``lowest offer'' means the lowest price  at which the residence was offered for sale after February 28, 1975.  [T.D. 7391, 40 FR 55855, Dec. 2, 1975]    Sec.  1.44B-1  Credit for employment of certain new employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Targeted jobs credit. Under section 44B a  taxpayer may elect to claim a credit for wages (as defined in section  51(c) paid or incurred to members of a targeted group (as defined in  section 51(d)). Generally, to qualify for the credit, the wages must be  paid or incurred to members of a targeted group first hired after  September 26, 1978. However, wages paid of incurred to a vocational  rehabilitation referral (as defined in section 51(d)(2)) hired before  September 27, 1978, may qualify for the credit if a credit under section  44B (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) was  claimed for the individual by the taxpayer for a taxable year beginning  before January 1, 1979. The amount of the credit shall be determined  under section 51. Section 280C(b) (relating to the requirement that the  deduction for wages be reduced by the amount of the credit) and the  regulations thereunder will not apply to taxpayers who do not elect to  claim the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> New jobs credit. Under section 44B (as in effect prior to  enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) a taxpayer may elect to claim as a  credit the amount determined under sections 51, 52, and 53 (as in effect  prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978). Section 280C(b)  (relating to the requirement that the deduction for wages be reduced by  the amount of the credit) and the regulations thereunder will not apply  to taxpayers who do not elect to claim the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election to claim the  targeted jobs credit and the new jobs credit is made by claiming the  credit on an original return, or on an amended return, at any time  before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on the last date  prescribed by law for filing the return for the taxable year (determined  without regard to extensions). The election may be revoked within the  above-described 3-year period by filing an amended return on which the  credit is not claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(26)</em>; 68A Stat. 917,  26 U.S.C. 7805)  [T.D. 7921, 48 FR 52904, Nov. 23, 1983]</p><p class="depth0">Research Credit--For Taxable Years Beginning Before January 1, 1990    Sec.  1.41-0A  Table of contents.</p><p class="depth0">This section lists the paragraphs contained in Sec.

[T.D. 8930, 66 FR 295, Jan. 3, 2001]    Sec.  1.41-3A  Base period research expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Number of years in base period. The term ``base period''  generally means the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the year for  which a credit is being determined (``determination year''). However, if  the first taxable year of the taxpayer ending after June 30, 1981, ends  in 1981 or 1982, then with respect to that taxable year the term ``base  period'' means the immediately preceding taxable year. If the second  taxable year of the taxpayer ending after June 30, 1981, ends in 1982 or  1983, then with respect to that taxable year the term ``base period''  means the 2 immediately preceding taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> New taxpayers. If, with respect to any determination year, the  taxpayer has not been in existence for the number of preceding taxable  years that are included under paragraph (a) of this section in the base  period for that year, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this  section (relating to the determination of average qualified research  expenses during the base period), the taxpayer shall be treated as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Having been in existence for that number of additional 12-month  taxable years that is necessary to complete the base period specified in  paragraph (a) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Having had qualified research expenses of zero in each of those  additional years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of base period research expenses. For any  determination year, the term ``base period research expenses'' means the  greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The average qualified research expenses for taxable years during  the base period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fifty percent of the qualified research expenses for the  determination year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for short taxable years--(1) Short determination  year. If the determination year for which a research credit is being  taken is a short taxable year, the amount taken into account under  paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section shall be modified by multiplying that  amount by the number of months in the short taxable year and dividing  the result by 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Short base period year. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, if a year in the base period is a short taxable year, the  qualified research expenses paid or incurred in the short taxable year  are deemed to be equal to the qualified research expenses actually paid  or incurred in that year multiplied by 12 and divided by the number of  months in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Years overlapping the effective dates of section 41 (section  44F)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination years. If a determination year includes months  before July 1981, the determination year is deemed to be a short taxable  year including only the months after June 1981. Accordingly, paragraph  (d)(1) of this section is applied for purposes of determining the base  period expenses for such year. See section 221(d)(2) of the Economic  Recovery Tax Act of 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Base period years. No adjustment is required in the case of a  base period year merely because it overlaps June 30, 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Number of months in a short taxable year. The number of months  in a short taxable year is equal to the number of whole calendar months  contained in the year plus fractions for any partially included months.  The fraction for a partially included month is equal to the number of  days in the month that are included in the short taxable year divided by  the total number of days in that month. Thus, if a short taxable year  begins on January 1, 1982, and ends on June 9, 1982, it consists of 5  and 9/30 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corp., an accrual-method taxpayer using the calendar  year as its taxable year, is organized and begins carrying on a trade or  business during 1979 and subsequently incurs qualified research expenses  as follows:  1979...........................................................     $10x 1980...........................................................     150x 1/1/81-6/30/81.................................................      90x 7/1/81-12/31/81................................................     110x 1982...........................................................     250x 1983...........................................................     450x</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section requires that the determination year  be treated as a short taxable year. Thus, for purposes of paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, as modified by paragraph (d)(1) of this section,  the average qualified research expenses for taxable years during the  base period are $75x ($150x, the average qualified research expenses for  the base period, multiplied by 6, the number of months in the  determination year after June 30, 1981, and divided by 12). Because this  amount is greater than the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section (50 percent of the determination year's qualified research  expense of $110x, or $55x), the amount of base period research expenses  is $75x. The credit for determination year 1981 is equal to 25 percent  of the excess of $110x (the qualified research expenditures incurred  during the determination year including only expenditures accrued on or  after July 1, 1981, through the end of the determination year) over $75x  (the base period research expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination year 1982. For determination year 1982, the base  period consists of the 2 immediately preceding taxable years, 1980 and  1981. The amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (the  average qualified research expenses for taxable years during the base  period) is $175x (($150x+$90x+$110x)/2). This amount is greater than the  amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, (50 percent of  $250x, or $125x). Accordingly, the amount of base period research  expenses is $175x. The credit for determination year 1982 is equal to 25  percent of the excess of $250x (the qualified research expenses incurred  during the determination year) over $175x (the base period research  expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination year 1983. For determination year 1983, the base  period consists of the 3 immediately preceding taxable years 1980, 1981  and 1982. The amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section  (the average qualified research expenses for taxable years during the  base period) is $200x (($150x+$200x+$250x)/3). The amount determined  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section   is $225x (50 percent of the $450x of qualified research expenses in  1983). Accordingly, the amount of base period research expenses is  $225x. The credit for determination year 1983 is equal to 25 percent of  the excess of $450x (the qualified research expenses incurred during the  determination year) over $225x (the base period research expenses).</p><p class="depth0">Examp1e 2. Y, an accrual-basis corporation using the calendar year  as its taxable year comes into existence and begins carrying on a trade  or business on July 1, 1983.

For determination year 1983, the base  period consists of the 3 immediately preceding taxable years: 1980, 1981  and 1982. Although Y was not in existence during 1980, 1981 and 1982, Y  is treated under paragraph (b) of this section as having been in  existence during those years with qualified research expenses of zero.  Thus, the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (the  average qualified research expenses for taxable years during the base  period) is $0x (($0x+$0x+$0x)/3). The amount determined under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section is $40x (50 percent of $80x). Accordingly, the  amount of base period research expenses is $40x. The credit for  determination year 1983 is equal to 25 percent of the excess of $80x  (the qualified research expenses incurred during the determination year)  over $40x (the base period research expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination year 1984. For determination year 1984, the base  period consists of the 3 immediately preceding taxable years: 1981,  1982, and 1983. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Y is treated as  having been in existence during years 1981 and 1982 with qualified  research expenses of zero. Because July 1 through December 31, 1983 is a  short taxable year, paragraph (d)(2) of this section requires that the  qualified research expenses for that year be adjusted to $160x for  purposes of determining the average qualified research expenses during  the base period. The $160x results from the actual qualified research  expenses for that year ($80x) multiplied by 12 and divided by 6 (the  number of months in the short taxable year). Accordingly, the amount  determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (the average qualified  research expenses for taxable years during the base period) is $53\1/3\x  (($0x+$0x+$160x)/3). The amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section is $100x (50 percent of $200x). The amount of base period  research expenses is $100x. The credit for determination year 1984 is  equal to 25 percent of the excess of $200x (the qualified research  expenses incurred during the determination year) over $100x (the base  period research expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination year 1985. For determination year 1985, the base  period consists of the 3 immediately preceding taxable years: 1982,  1983, and 1984. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, Y is treated  as having been in existence during 1982 with qualified research expenses  of zero. Because July 1 through December 31, 1982, is a short taxable  year, paragraph (d)(2) of this section requires that the qualified  research expense for that year be adjusted to $160x for purposes of  determining the average qualified research expenses for taxable years  during the base period. This $160x is the actual qualified research  expense for that year ($80x) multiplied by 12 and divided by 6 (the  number of months in the short taxable year). Accordingly, the amount  determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (the average qualified  research expenses for taxable years during the base period) is $120x  (($0x+$160x+$200x)/3). The amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section is $100x (50 percent of $200x). The amount of base period  research expenses is $120x. The credit for determination year 1985 is  equal to 25 percent of the excess of $200x (the qualified research  expenses incurred during the determination year) over $120x (the base  period research expenses).

A taxpayer holding a  qualified equity investment on a credit allowance date which occurs  during the taxable year may claim the new markets tax credit determined  under section 45D(a) and this section for such taxable year in an amount  equal to the applicable percentage of the amount paid to a qualified  community development entity (CDE) for such investment at its original  issue. Qualified equity investment is defined in paragraph (c) of this  section. Credit allowance date is defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section. Applicable percentage is defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section. A CDE is a qualified community development entity as defined in  section 45D(c). The amount paid at original issue is determined under  paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit allowance date. The term credit allowance date means,  with respect to any qualified equity investment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the investment is initially made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each of the 6 anniversary dates of such date thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable percentage. The applicable percentage is 5 percent  for the first 3 credit allowance dates and 6 percent for the other 4  credit allowance dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amount paid at original issue. The amount paid to the CDE for a  qualified equity investment at its original issue consists of all  amounts paid by the taxpayer to, or on behalf of, the CDE (including any  underwriter's fees) to purchase the investment at its original issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified equity investment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term qualified  equity investment means any equity investment (as defined in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section) in a CDE if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The investment is acquired by the taxpayer at its original issue  (directly or through an underwriter) solely in exchange for cash;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantially all (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this  section) of such cash is used by the CDE to make qualified low-income  community investments (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The investment is designated for purposes of section 45D and  this section as a qualified equity investment or a non-real estate  qualified equity investment (as defined in paragraph (c)(8) of this  section) by the CDE on its books and records using any reasonable  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em> in an entity that is a corporation for Federal tax purposes  and any capital interest in an entity that is a partnership for Federal  tax purposes. See Sec. Sec.  301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3 of this  chapter for rules governing when a business entity, such as a business  trust or limited liability company, is classified as a corporation or a  partnership for Federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equity investments made prior to allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, an equity  investment in an entity is not eligible to be designated as a qualified  equity investment if it is   made before the entity enters into an allocation agreement with the  Secretary. An allocation agreement is an agreement between the Secretary  and a CDE relating to a new markets tax credit allocation under section  45D(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section, an equity investment in an entity is eligible to be designated  as a qualified equity investment or a non-real estate qualified equity  investment under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Allocation applications submitted by August 29, 2002. (1) The  equity investment is made on or after April 20, 2001;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of the equity investment as a qualified equity  investment is made for a credit allocation received pursuant to an  allocation application submitted to the Secretary no later than August  29, 2002; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The equity investment otherwise satisfies the requirements of  section 45D and this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other allocation applications. (1) The equity investment is made  on or after the date the Secretary publishes a Notice of Allocation  Availability (NOAA) in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of the equity investment as a qualified equity  investment is made for a credit allocation received pursuant to an  allocation application submitted to the Secretary under that NOAA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The equity investment otherwise satisfies the requirements of  section 45D and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to receive allocation. For purposes of paragraph  (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, if the entity in which the equity  investment is made does not receive an allocation pursuant to an  allocation application submitted no later than August 29, 2002, the  equity investment will not be eligible to be designated as a qualified  equity investment. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this  section, if the entity in which the equity investment is made does not  receive an allocation under the NOAA described in paragraph  (c)(3)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, the equity investment will not be  eligible to be designated as a qualified equity investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Initial investment date. If an equity investment is designated  as a qualified equity investment in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii)  of this section, the investment is treated as initially made on the  effective date of the allocation agreement between the CDE and the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term qualified equity  investment does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any equity investment issued by a CDE more than 5 years after  the date the CDE enters into an allocation agreement (as defined in  paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) with the Secretary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any equity investment by a CDE in another CDE, if the CDE making  the investment has received an allocation under section 45D(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation limitation. The maximum amount of equity investments  issued by a CDE that may be designated under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of  this section by the CDE may not exceed the portion of the limitation  amount allocated to the CDE by the Secretary under section 45D(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, the 7-year credit  period means the period of 7 years beginning on the date the qualified  equity investment is initially made. See paragraph (c)(6) of this  section for circumstances in which a CDE may treat more than one equity  investment as a single qualified equity investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, cost basis includes  the cost basis of any qualified low-income community investment that  becomes worthless. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the  treatment of amounts received by a CDE in payment of, or for, capital,  equity or principal with respect to a qualified low-income community  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, cost basis includes the cost  basis of any qualified low-income community investment that becomes  worthless. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the treatment of  amounts received by a CDE in payment of, or for, capital, equity or  principal with respect to a qualified low-income community investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Time limit for making investments. The taxpayer's cash  investment received by a CDE is treated as invested in a qualified low- income community investment as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section only to the extent that the cash is so invested within the 12- month period beginning on the date the cash is paid by the taxpayer  (directly or through an underwriter) to the CDE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reduced substantially-all percentage. For purposes of the  substantially-all requirement (including the direct-tracing calculation  under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section and the safe harbor  calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section), 85 percent is  reduced to 75 percent for the seventh year of the 7-year credit period  (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate an application of  this paragraph (c)(5):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a partnership and a CDE that has received a $1  million new markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. On  September 1, 2004, X uses a line of credit from a bank to fund a $1  million loan to Y. The loan is a qualified low-income community  investment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. On September 5, 2004,  A pays $1 million to acquire a capital interest in X. X uses the  proceeds of A's equity investment to pay off the $1 million line of  credit that was   used to fund the loan to Y. X's aggregate gross assets consist of the $1  million loan to Y and $100,000 in other assets. A's equity investment in  X does not satisfy the substantially-all requirement under paragraph  (c)(5)(i) of this section using the direct-tracing calculation under  paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section because the cash from A's equity  investment is not used to make X's loan to Y. However, A's equity  investment in X satisfies the substantially-all requirement using the  safe harbor calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section  because at least 85 percent of X's aggregate gross assets are invested  in qualified low-income community investments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X is a partnership and a CDE that has received a new  markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. On August 1, 2004, A  pays $100,000 for a capital interest in X. On August 5, 2004, X uses the  proceeds of A's equity investment to make an equity investment in Y. X  controls Y within the meaning of paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this  section. For the annual period ending July 31, 2005, Y is a qualified  active low-income community business (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of  this section). Thus, for that period, A's equity investment satisfies  the substantially-all requirement under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this  section using the direct-tracing calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)  of this section. For the annual period ending July 31, 2006, Y no longer  is a qualified active low-income community business. Thus, for that  period, A's equity investment does not satisfy the substantially-all  requirement using the direct-tracing calculation. However, during the  entire annual period ending July 31, 2006, X's remaining assets are  invested in qualified low-income community investments with an aggregate  cost basis of $900,000. Consequently, for the annual period ending July  31, 2006, at least 85 percent of X's aggregate gross assets are invested  in qualified low-income community investments. Thus, for the annual  period ending July 31, 2006, A's equity investment satisfies the  substantially-all requirement using the safe harbor calculation under  paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. X is a partnership and a CDE that has received a new  markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. On August 1, 2004, A  and B each pay $100,000 for a capital interest in X. X does not treat  A's and B's equity investments as one qualified equity investment under  paragraph (c)(6) of this section. On September 1, 2004, X uses the  proceeds of A's equity investment to make an equity investment in Y and  X uses the proceeds of B's equity investment to make an equity  investment in Z. X has no assets other than its investments in Y and Z.  X controls Y and Z within the meaning of paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this  section. For the annual period ending July 31, 2005, Y and Z are  qualified active low-income community businesses (as defined in  paragraph (d)(4) of this section). Thus, for the annual period ending  July 31, 2005, A's and B's equity investments satisfy the substantially- all requirement under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section using either  the direct-tracing calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this  section or the safe harbor calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of  this section. For the annual period ending July 31, 2006, Y, but not Z,  is a qualified active low-income community business. Thus, for the  annual period ending July 31, 2006--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> X does not satisfy the substantially-all requirement using the  safe harbor calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A's equity investment satisfies the substantially-all  requirement using the direct-tracing calculation because A's equity  investment is directly traceable to Y; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> B's equity investment does not satisfy the substantially-all  requirement because B's equity investment is traceable to Z.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. X is a partnership and a CDE that has received a new  markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. On November 1, 2004, A  pays $100,000 for a capital interest in X. On December 1, 2004, B pays  $100,000 for a capital interest in X. On December 31, 2004, X uses  $85,000 from A's equity investment and $85,000 from B's equity  investment to make a $170,000 equity investment in Y, a qualified active  low-income community business (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this  section). X has no assets other than its investment in Y. X determines  whether A's and B's equity investments satisfy the substantially-all  requirement under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section on December 31,  2004. The calculation for A's and B's equity investments is 85 percent  using either the direct-tracing calculation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)  of this section or the safe harbor calculation under paragraph  (c)(5)(iii) of this section. Therefore, for the annual periods ending  October 31, 2005, and November 30, 2005, A's and B's equity investments,  respectively, satisfy the substantially-all requirement under paragraph  (c)(5)(i) of this section. For the subsequent annual period, X performs  its calculations on December 31, 2005, and June 30, 2006. The average of  the two calculations on December 31, 2005, and June 30, 2006, is 85  percent using either the direct-tracing calculation under paragraph  (c)(5)(ii) of this section or the safe harbor calculation under  paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. Therefore, for the annual periods  ending October 31, 2006, and November 30, 2006, A's and B's equity  investments, respectively, satisfy the substantially-all requirement  under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>, the rules in this section shall be construed in a manner  consistent with that treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Subsequent purchasers. A qualified equity investment includes  any equity investment that would (but for paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section) be a qualified equity investment in the hands of the taxpayer  if the investment was a qualified equity investment in the hands of a  prior holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Non-real estate qualified equity investment. If a qualified  equity investment is designated as a non-real estate qualified equity  investment under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, then the  qualified equity investment may only satisfy the substantially-all  requirement under paragraph (c)(5) of this section if the CDE makes  qualified low-income community investments that are directly traceable  (including investments made through one or more CDEs) to non-real estate  qualified active low-income community businesses (as defined in  paragraph (d)(10) of this section). The proceeds of a non-real estate  qualified equity investment cannot be used for transactions involving a  qualified active low-income community business that is not a non-real  estate qualified active low-income community business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Qualified low-income community investments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  term qualified low-income community investment means any of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Investment in a qualified active low-income community business  or a non-real estate qualified active low-income community business. Any  capital or equity investment in, or loan to, any qualified active low- income community business (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this  section) or any non-real estate qualified active low-income community  business (as defined in paragraph (d)(10) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Purchase of certain loans from CDEs--(A) In general. The  purchase by a CDE (the ultimate CDE) from another CDE (whether or not  that CDE has received an allocation from the Secretary under section  45D(f)(2)) of any loan made by such entity that is a qualified low- income community investment. A loan purchased by the ultimate CDE from  another CDE is a qualified low-income community investment if it  qualifies as a qualified low-income community investment either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the time the loan was made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At the time the ultimate CDE purchases the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain loans made before CDE certification. For purposes of  paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, a loan by an entity is treated  as made by a CDE, notwithstanding that the entity was not a CDE at the  time it made the loan, if the entity is a CDE at the time it sells the  loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Intermediary CDEs. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of  this section, the purchase of a loan by the ultimate CDE from a CDE that  did not make the loan (the second CDE) is treated as a purchase of the  loan by the ultimate CDE from the CDE that made the loan (the  originating CDE) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The second CDE purchased the loan from the originating CDE (or  from another CDE); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each entity that sold the loan was a CDE at the time it sold the  loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples.

X is a partnership and a CDE that has received a new  markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. Y, a corporation, made  a $500,000 loan to Z in 1999. In January of 2004, Y is certified as a  CDE. On September 1, 2004, X purchases the loan from Y. At the time X  purchases the loan, Z is a qualified active low-income community  business under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the  loan purchased by X from Y is a qualified low-income community  investment under paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that on  February 1, 2004, Y sells the loan to W and on September 1, 2004, W  sells the loan to X. W is a CDE. Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this  section, X's purchase of the loan from W is treated as the purchase of  the loan from Y.

At least 40 percent of  the use of the tangible property of such entity (whether owned or  leased) is within any low-income community.

The application of paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this  section is illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X is a corporation engaged in the business of moving and  hauling scrap metal. X operates its business from a building and an  adjoining parking lot that X owns. The building and the parking lot are  located in a low-income community (as defined in section 45D(e)). X's  cost basis under section 1012 for the building and parking lot is  $200,000. During the taxable year, X operates its business 10 hours a  day, 6 days a week. X owns and uses 40 trucks in its business, which, on  average, are used 6 hours a day outside a low-income community and 4  hours a day inside a low-income community (including time in the parking  lot). The cost basis under section 1012 of each truck is $25,000. During  non-business hours, the trucks are parked in the lot. Only X's 10-hour  business days are used in calculating the use of tangible property  percentage under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section. Thus, the  numerator of the tangible property calculation is $600,000 (\4/10\ of  $1,000,000 (the $25,000 cost basis of each truck times 40 trucks) plus  $200,000 (the cost basis of the building and parking lot)) and the  denominator is $1,200,000 (the total cost basis of the trucks, building,  and parking lot), resulting in 50 percent of the use of X's tangible  property being within a low-income community.

If the amount reinvested in a qualifying entity exceeds the  maximum aggregate portion of the non-real estate qualified equity  investment, then the excess will not be treated as invested in a  qualified low-income community investment. The maximum aggregate portion  of the non-real estate qualified equity investment that may be  reinvested into a qualifying entity, which will be treated as  continuously invested in a qualified low-income community investment,  may not exceed the following percentages of the non-real estate  qualified equity investment in the following years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 15 percent in Year 2 of the 7-year credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 30 percent in Year 3 of the 7-year credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 50 percent in Year 4 of the 7-year credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 85 percent in Year 5 and Year 6 of the 7-year credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Seventh year of the 7-year credit period.

If, at any time during the 7-year  period beginning on the date of the original issue of a qualified equity  investment in a CDE, there is a recapture event under paragraph (e)(2)  of this section with respect to such investment, then the tax imposed by  Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year in which the  recapture event occurs is increased   by the credit recapture amount under section 45D(g)(2). A recapture  event under paragraph (e)(2) of this section requires recapture of  credits allowed to the taxpayer who purchased the equity investment from  the CDE at its original issue and to all subsequent holders of that  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recapture event.

For  purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, an equity investment  in a CDE that is treated as a C corporation for Federal tax purposes is  redeemed when section 302(a) applies to amounts received by the equity  holder. An equity investment is treated as cashed out when section  301(c)(2) or section 301(c)(3) applies to amounts received by the equity  holder. An equity investment is not treated as cashed out when only  section 301(c)(1) applies to amounts received by the equity holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Equity investment in an S corporation.

Bankruptcy of a CDE is not a recapture event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Waiver of requirement or extension of time--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The  Commissioner may waive a requirement or extend a deadline if such waiver  or extension does not materially frustrate the purposes of section 45D  and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner for requesting a waiver or extension. A CDE that  believes it has good cause for a waiver or an extension may request  relief from the Commissioner in a ruling request. The request should set  forth all the relevant facts and include a detailed explanation  describing the event or events relating to the request for a waiver or  an extension. For further information on the application procedure for a  ruling, see Rev. Proc. 2005-1 (2005-1 I.R.B. 1) or its successor revenue  procedure (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Terms and conditions. The granting of a waiver or an extension  to a CDE under this section may require adjustments of the CDE's  requirements under section 45D and this section as may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (e) is illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 2003, A and B acquire separate qualified equity  investments in X, a partnership. X is a CDE that has received a new  markets tax credit allocation from the Secretary. X uses the proceeds of  A's qualified equity investment to make a qualified low-income community  investment in Y, and X uses the proceeds of B's qualified equity  investment to make a qualified low-income community investment in Z. Y  and Z are not CDEs. X controls both Y and Z within the meaning of  paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. In 2003, Y and Z are qualified  active low-income community businesses. In 2007, Y, but not Z, is a  qualified active low-income community business and X does not satisfy  the substantially-all requirement using the safe harbor calculation  under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. A's equity investment  satisfies the substantially-all requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of  this section using the direct-tracing calculation of paragraph  (c)(5)(ii) of this section because A's equity investment is traceable to  Y. However, B's equity investment fails the substantially-all  requirement using the direct-tracing calculation because B's equity  investment is traceable to Z. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of  this section, there is a recapture event for B's equity investment (but  not A's equity investment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Basis reduction--(1) In general. A taxpayer's basis in a  qualified equity investment is reduced by the amount of any new markets  tax credit determined under paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section with  respect to the investment. A basis reduction occurs on each credit  allowance date under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This paragraph  (f) does not apply for purposes of sections 1202, 1400B, and 1400F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment in basis of interest in partnership or S corporation.  The adjusted basis of either a partner's interest in a partnership, or  stock in an S corporation, must be appropriately adjusted to take into  account adjustments made under paragraph (f)(1) of this section in the  basis of a qualified equity investment held by the partnership or S  corporation (as the case may be).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Anti-abuse. If a principal purpose of a  transaction or a series of transactions is to achieve a result that is  inconsistent with the purposes of section 45D and this section, the  Commissioner may treat the transaction or series of transactions as  causing a recapture event under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification by CDE to taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Allowance of new markets tax credit. A CDE must provide notice to any  taxpayer who acquires a qualified equity investment in the CDE at its  original issue that the equity investment is a qualified equity  investment entitling the taxpayer to claim the new markets tax credit.  The notice must be provided by the CDE to the taxpayer no later than 60  days after the date the taxpayer makes the investment in the CDE. The  notice must contain the amount paid to the CDE for the qualified equity  investment at its original issue and the taxpayer identification number  of the CDE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recapture event. If, at any time during the 7-year period  beginning on the date of the original issue of a qualified equity  investment in a CDE, there is a recapture event under paragraph (e)(2)  of this section with respect to such investment, the CDE must provide  notice to each holder, including all prior holders, of the investment  that a recapture event has occurred. The notice must be provided by the  CDE no later than 60 days after the date the CDE becomes aware of the  recapture event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CDE reporting requirements to Secretary. Each CDE must comply  with such reporting requirements to the Secretary as the Secretary may  prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manner of claiming new markets tax credit. A taxpayer may  claim the new markets tax credit for each applicable taxable year by  completing Form 8874, ``New Markets Credit,'' and by filing Form 8874  with the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reporting recapture tax. If there is a recapture event with  respect to a taxpayer's equity investment in a CDE, the taxpayer must  include the credit recapture amount under section 45D(g)(2) on the line  for recapture taxes on the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the  taxable year in which the recapture event under paragraph (e)(2) of this  section occurs (or on the line for total tax, if there is no such line  for recapture taxes) and write NMCR (new markets credit recapture) next  to the entry space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other Federal tax benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, the availability of Federal tax  benefits does not limit the availability of the new markets tax credit.  Federal tax benefits that do not limit the availability of the new  markets tax credit include, for example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rehabilitation credit under section 47;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All deductions under sections 167 and 168, including the  additional first-year depreciation under section 168(k), and the expense  deduction for certain depreciable property under section 179; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All tax benefits relating to certain designated areas such as  empowerment zones and enterprise communities under sections 1391 through  1397D, the District of Columbia Enterprise Zone under sections 1400  through 1400B, renewal communities under sections 1400E through 1400J,  and the New York Liberty Zone under section 1400L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Low-income housing credit. If a CDE makes a capital or equity  investment or a loan with respect to a qualified low-income building  under section 42, the investment or loan is not a qualified low-income  community investment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the  extent the building's eligible basis under section 42(d) is financed by  the proceeds of the investment or loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bankruptcy of CDE. The bankruptcy of a CDE does not preclude a  taxpayer from continuing to claim the new markets tax credit on the  remaining credit allowance dates under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(4) of this section, this  section applies on or after December 22, 2004, and may be applied by  taxpayers before December 22, 2004. The provisions that apply before  December 22, 2004, are contained in Sec.  1.45D-1T (see 26 CFR part 1  revised as of April 1, 2003, and April 1, 2004).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section as it relates to  the restriction on lessees described in paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) of this  section applies to qualified low-income community investments made on or  after June 22, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Targeted populations. The rules in paragraph (d)(9) of this  section and the last sentence in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section  apply to taxable years ending on or after December 5, 2011.

For purposes of section 38, the railroad track  maintenance credit (RTMC) for qualified railroad track maintenance  expenditures (QRTME) paid or incurred by an eligible taxpayer during the  taxable year is determined under this section. A taxpayer claiming the  RTMC must do so by filing Form 8900, ``Qualified Railroad Track  Maintenance Credit,'' with its timely filed (including extensions)  Federal income tax return for the taxable year the RTMC is claimed.  Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions of terms. Paragraph  (c) of this section provides rules for computing the RTMC, including  rules regarding limitations on the amount of the credit. Paragraph (d)  of this section provides rules for assigning miles of railroad track.  Paragraph (e) of this section contains rules for adjusting basis for the  amount of the RTMC claimed by an eligible taxpayer. Paragraph (f) of  this section contains rules for computing the amount of the RTMC in the  case of a controlled group, and for the allocation of the group credit  among members of the controlled group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.

On November 7,  2006, N assigns for purposes of section 45G 300 miles of eligible  railroad track to O. O receives no other assignment of eligible railroad  track in 2006.

For 2006, O is an eligible taxpayer because, during 2006, O  provides railroad-related property to N and receives an assignment of  300 eligible railroad track miles from N.

X further determines the  credit limitation amount under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for  2006 to be $1,750,000 ($3,500 multiplied by 500 miles of eligible  railroad track). Because X's tentative amount of RTMC does not exceed  X's credit limitation amount for 2006, X may claim a RTMC for 2006 in  the amount of $500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Of the $1 million QRTME incurred by X during 2006, X  determines under the track maintenance allowance method that $750,000 is  the track maintenance allowance under section 162 and $250,000 is the  capitalized amount for the track structure. In accordance with paragraph  (e)(2) of this section, X reduces the capitalized amount of $250,000 by  the RTMC of $500,000 claimed by X for 2006, but not below zero. Thus,  the capitalized amount of $250,000 is reduced to zero.

Sec.  1.45R-2, 1.45R-3, 1.45R-4, and 1.45R-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Average premium. The term average premium means an average  premium for the small group market in the rating area in which the  employee enrolls for coverage. The average premium for the small group  market in a rating area is determined by the Secretary of Health and  Human Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Composite billing. The term composite billing means a system of  billing under which a health insurer charges a uniform premium for each  of the employer's employees or charges a single aggregate premium for  the group of covered employees that the employer then divides by the  number of covered employees to determine the uniform premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit period--(i) In general. The term credit period means,  with respect to any eligible small employer (or any predecessor  employer), the two-consecutive-taxable-year period beginning with the  first taxable year beginning after 2013, for which the eligible small  employer files an income tax return with an attached Form 8941, ``Credit  for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums'' (or files a Form 990-T,  ``Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return,'' with an attached  Form 8941 in the case of a tax-exempt eligible employer). For a  transition rule for 2014, see Sec.  1.45R-3</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2014, an eligible small employer (Employer)  that uses a calendar year as its taxable year begins to offer insurance  through a SHOP Exchange. Employer has 4 employees and otherwise  qualifies for the credit, but none of the employees enroll in the  coverage offered by Employer through the SHOP Exchange. In mid-2015, the  4 employees enroll for coverage through the SHOP Exchange but Employer  does not file Form 8941 or claim the credit. In 2016, Employer has 20  employees and all are enrolled in coverage offered through the SHOP  Exchange. Employer files Form 8941 with Employer's 2016 tax return to  claim the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's taxable year 2016 is the first year of  the credit period. Accordingly, Employer's two-year credit period is  2016 and 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, but Employer files  Form 8941 with Employer's 2015 tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's taxable year 2015 is the first year of  the credit period. Accordingly, Employer's two-year credit period is  2015 and 2016 (and does not include 2017). Employer is entitled to a  credit based on a partial year of SHOP Exchange coverage for Employer's  taxable year 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Eligible small employer. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term eligible small employer  means an employer that meets the requirements set forth in Sec.  1.45R- 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the definition of tax-exempt eligible small employer, see  paragraph (a)(19) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A farmers' cooperative described under section 521 that is  subject to tax pursuant to section 1381, and otherwise meets the  requirements of this paragraph (a)(4) and Sec.  1.45R-2, is an eligible  small employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise specifically  provided in this paragraph (a)(5), the term employee means an individual  who is an employee of the eligible small employer under the common law  standard. See Sec.  31.3121(d)-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Leased employees. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5), the  term employee also includes a leased employee (as defined in section  414(n)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain individuals excluded. The term employee does not  include independent contractors (including sole proprietors), partners  in a partnership, shareholders owning more than two percent of an S  corporation, and any owners of more than five percent of other  businesses. The term employee also does not include family members of  these owners and partners, including   the employee-spouse of a shareholder owning more than two percent of the  stock of an S corporation, the employee-spouse of an owner of more than  five percent of a business, the employee-spouse of a partner owning more  than a five percent interest in a partnership, and the employee-spouse  of a sole proprietor, or any other member of the household of these  owners and partners who qualifies as a dependent under section  152(d)(2)(H).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Seasonal workers. The term employee does not include seasonal  workers unless the seasonal worker provides services to the employer on  more than 120 days during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ministers. Whether a minister is an employee is determined under  the common law standard for determining worker status. If, under the  common law standard, a minister is not an employee, the minister is not  an employee for purposes of this paragraph (a)(5) and is not taken into  account in determining an employer's FTEs, and premiums paid for the  minister's health insurance coverage are not taken into account in  computing the credit. If, under the common law standard, a minister is  an employee, the minister is an employee for purposes of this paragraph  (a)(5), and is taken into account in determining an employer's FTEs, and  premiums paid by the employer for the minister's health insurance  coverage can be taken into account in computing the credit. Because the  performance of services by a minister in the exercise of his or her  ministry is not treated as employment for purposes of the Federal  Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), compensation paid to the minister is  not wages as defined under section 3121(a), and is not counted as wages  for purposes of computing an employer's average annual wages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Former employees. Premiums paid on behalf of a former employee  with no hours of service may be treated as paid on behalf of an employee  for purposes of calculating the credit (see Sec.  1.45R-3) provided  that, if so treated, the former employee is also treated as an employee  for purposes of the uniform percentage requirement (see Sec.  1.45R-4).  For the treatment of terminated employees for purposes of determining  employer eligibility for the credit, see Sec.  1.45R-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Employer-computed composite rate. The term employer-computed  composite rate refers to a rate for a tier of coverage (such as  employee-only, dependent or family) of a QHP that is the average rate  determined by adding the premiums for that tier of coverage for all  employees eligible to participate in the QHP (whether or not they  actually receive coverage under the plan or under that tier of coverage)  and dividing by the total number of such eligible employees. The  employer-computed composite rate may be used in list billing to convert  individual premiums for a tier of coverage into an employer-computed  composite rate for that tier of coverage. See Sec.  1.45R-4(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exchange. The term Exchange means an exchange as defined in 45  CFR 155.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Family member. The term family member is defined with respect to  a taxpayer as a child (or descendant of a child); a sibling or step- sibling; a parent (or ancestor of a parent); a step-parent; a niece or  nephew; an aunt or uncle; or a son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in- law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law. A spouse of any of  these family members is also considered a family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Full-time equivalent employee (FTE). The number of full-time  equivalent employees (FTEs) is determined by dividing the total number  of hours of service for which wages were paid by the employer to  employees during the taxable year by 2,080. See Sec.  1.45R-2(d) and (e)  for permissible methods of calculating hours of service and the method  for calculating the number of an employer's FTEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> List billing. The term list billing refers to a system of  billing under which a health insurer lists a separate premium for each  employee based on the age of the employee or other factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Net premium payments. The term net premium payments means, in  the case of an employer receiving a State tax credit or State subsidy  for providing health insurance to its employees, the excess of the  employer's actual premium payments over the State tax credit or State  subsidy received by the   employer. In the case of a State payment directly to an insurance  company (or another entity licensed under State law to engage in the  business of insurance), the employer's net premium payments are the  employer's actual premium payments. If a State-administered program  (such as Medicaid or another program that makes payments directly to a  health care provider or insurance company on behalf of individuals and  their families who meet certain eligibility guidelines) makes payments  that are not contingent on the maintenance of an employer-provided group  health plan, those payments are not taken into account in determining  the employer's net premium payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Nonelective contribution. The term nonelective contribution  means an employer contribution other than a contribution pursuant to a  salary reduction arrangement under section 125.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Payroll taxes. For purposes of section 45R, the term payroll  taxes means amounts required to be withheld as tax from the employees of  a tax-exempt eligible small employer under section 3402, amounts  required to be withheld from such employees under section 3101(b), and  amounts of tax imposed on the tax-exempt eligible small employer under  section 3111(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Qualified health plan or QHP. The term qualified health plan or  the term QHP means a qualified health plan as defined in Affordable Care  Act section 1301(a) (see 42 U.S.C. 18021(a)), but does not include a  catastrophic plan described in Affordable Care Act section 1302(e) (see  42 U.S.C. 18022(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Qualifying arrangement. The term qualifying arrangement means  an arrangement that requires an eligible small employer to make a  nonelective contribution on behalf of each employee who enrolls in a QHP  offered to employees by the employer through a SHOP Exchange in an  amount equal to a uniform percentage (not less than 50 percent) of the  premium cost of the QHP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Seasonal worker. The term seasonal worker means a worker who  performs labor or services on a seasonal basis as defined by the  Secretary of Labor, including (but not limited to) workers covered by 29  CFR 500.20(s)(1), and retail workers employed exclusively during holiday  seasons. Employers may apply a reasonable, good faith interpretation of  the term seasonal worker and a reasonable good faith interpretation of  29 CFR 500.20(s)(1) (including as applied by analogy to workers and  employment positions not otherwise covered under 29 CFR 500.20(s)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> SHOP dependent coverage. The term SHOP dependent coverage  refers to coverage offered through SHOP separately to any individual who  is or may become eligible for coverage under the terms of a group health  plan offered through SHOP because of a relationship to a participant- employee, whether or not a dependent of the participant-employee under  section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. The term SHOP dependent  coverage does not include coverage such as family coverage, which  includes coverage of the participant-employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). The term Small  Business Health Options Program (SHOP) means an Exchange established  pursuant to section 1311 of the Affordable Care Act and defined in 45  CFR 155.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> State. The term State means a State as defined in section  7701(a)(10), including the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Tax-exempt eligible small employer. The term tax-exempt  eligible small employer means an eligible small employer that is exempt  from federal income tax under section 501(a) as an organization  described in section 501(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Tier. The term tier refers to a category of coverage under a  benefits package that varies only by the number of individuals covered.  For example, employee-only coverage, dependent coverage, and family  coverage would constitute three separate tiers of coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Tobacco surcharge. The term tobacco surcharge means any  allowable differential that is charged for insurance in the SHOP  Exchange that is attributable to tobacco use as the term tobacco use is  defined in 45 CFR 147.102(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> United States. The term United States means United States as  defined in section 7701(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(24)</em> Wages. The term wages for purposes of section 45R means wages  as defined under section 3121(a) for purposes of the Federal Insurance  Contributions Act (FICA), determined without regard to the social  security wage base limitation under section 3121(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(25)</em> Wellness program. The term wellness program for purposes of  section 45R means a program of health promotion or disease prevention  subject to the requirements of Sec.  54.9802-1(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for  periods after 2013. For rules relating to certain plan years beginning  in 2014, see Sec.  1.45R-3(i).  [T.D. 9672, 79 FR 36646, June 30, 2014]    Sec.  1.45R-2  Eligibility for the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. An employer does not fail to be  an eligible small employer merely because its employees are not  performing services in a trade or business of the employer. An employer  located outside the United States (including an employer located in a  U.S. territory) must have income effectively connected with the conduct  of a trade or business in the United States, and otherwise meet the  requirements of this section, to be an eligible small employer. For  eligibility standards for SHOP related to foreign employers, see 45 CFR  155.710. Paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section provide the rules  for determining whether the requirements to be an eligible small  employer are met, including rules related to identifying and counting  the number of the employer's FTEs, counting the employees' hours of  service, and determining the employer's average annual FTE wages for the  taxable year. For rules on determining whether the uniform percentage  requirement is met, see Sec.  1.45R-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>, (c) or (o), or  an affiliated service group under section 414(m), are taken into account  in determining whether any member of the controlled group or affiliated  service group is an eligible small employer. Similarly, all wages paid  to, and premiums paid for, employees by the members of the controlled  group or affiliated service group are taken into account when  determining the amount of the credit for a group treated as a single  employer under these rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employees taken into account. To be eligible for the credit, an  employer must have employees as defined in Sec.  1.45R-1(a)(5) during  the taxable year. All such employees of the eligible small employer are  taken into account for purposes of determining the employer's FTEs and  average annual FTE wages. Employees include employees who terminate  employment during the year for which the credit is being claimed,  employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement, and employees  who do not enroll in a QHP offered by the employer through a SHOP  Exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determining the hours of service performed by employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. An employee's hours of service for a year include each hour for  which an   employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of duties  for the employer during the employer's taxable year. It also includes  each hour for which an employee is paid, or entitled to payment, by the  employer on account of a period of time during which no duties are  performed due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including  disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty or leave of absence  (except that no more than 160 hours of service are required to be  counted for an employee on account of any single continuous period  during which the employee performs no duties).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permissible methods. In calculating the total number of hours of  service that must be taken into account for an employee during the  taxable year, eligible small employers need not use the same method for  all employees, and may apply different methods for different  classifications of employees if the classifications are reasonable and  consistently applied. Eligible small employers may change the method for  calculating employees' hours of service for each taxable year. An  eligible small employer may use any of the following three methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Actual hours worked. An employer may use the actual hours of  service provided by employees including hours worked and any other hours  for which payment is made or due (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Days-worked equivalency. An employer may use a days-worked  equivalency whereby the employee is credited with 8 hours of service for  each day for which the employee would be required to be credited with at  least one hour of service under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Weeks-worked equivalency. An employer may use a weeks-worked  equivalency whereby the employee is credited with 40 hours of service  for each week for which the employee would be required to be credited  with at least one hour of service under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of  paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under this method of counting hours, Employee A  must be credited with 2,080 hours of service (2,000 hours worked and 80  hours for which payment was made or due).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee B worked from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every day for 200  days. Employer uses the days-worked equivalency method described in  paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under this method of counting hours, Employee B  must be credited with 1,600 hours of service (8 hours for each day  Employee B would otherwise be credited with at least 1 hour of service x  200 days).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee C worked 49 weeks, took 2 weeks of vacation with  pay, and took 1 week of leave without pay. Employer uses the weeks- worked equivalency method described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under this method of counting hours, Employee C  must be credited with 2,040 hours of service (40 hours for each week  during which Employee C would otherwise be credited with at least 1 hour  of service x 51 weeks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employee D is a seasonal employee who worked for  120 days or less for Employer during the year. Employee D's hours are  not counted when determining the hours of service of Employer's  employees. Employee E works throughout most of the year and is not a  seasonal employee. Employer counts Employee E's 350 hours of service  during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> FTE Calculation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The number of an employer's  FTEs is determined by dividing the total hours of service, determined in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, credited during the year  to employees taken into account under paragraph (c) of this section (but  not more than 2,080 hours for any employee) by 2,080. The   result, if not a whole number, is then rounded to the next lowest whole  number. If, however, after dividing the total hours of service by 2,080,  the resulting number is less than one, the employer rounds up to one  FTE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A sole  proprietor pays 5 employees wages for 2,080 hours each, pays 3 employees  wages for 1,040 hours each, and pays 1 employee wages for 2,300 hours.  One of the employees working 2,080 hours is the sole proprietor's  nephew. The sole proprietor's FTEs would be calculated as follows: 8,320  hours of service for the 4 employees paid for 2,080 hours each (4 x  2,080); the sole proprietor's nephew is excluded from the FTE  calculation; 3,120 hours of service for the 3 employees paid for 1,040  hours each (3 x 1,040); and 2,080 hours of service for the 1 employee  paid for 2,300 hours (lesser of 2,300 and 2,080). The sum of the  included hours of service equals 13,520 hours of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The sole proprietor's FTEs equal 6 (13,520 divided  by 2,080 = 6.5, rounded to the next lowest whole number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determining the employer's average annual FTE wages--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. All wages paid to employees (including overtime pay) are taken  into account in computing an eligible small employer's average annual  FTE wages. The average annual wages paid by an employer for a taxable  year is determined by dividing the total wages paid by the eligible  small employer during the employer's taxable year to employees taken  into account under paragraph (c) of this section by the number of the  employer's FTEs for the year. The result is then rounded down to the  nearest $1,000 (if not otherwise a multiple of $1,000). For purposes of  determining the employer's average annual wages for the taxable year,  only wages that are paid for hours of service determined under paragraph  (d) of this section are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provision of  paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer has 26 FTEs with average annual  wages of $23,000. Only 22 of the employer's employees enroll for  coverage offered by the employer through a SHOP Exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The hours of service and wages of all employees are  taken into consideration in determining whether the employer is an  eligible small employer for purposes of the credit. Because the employer  does not have fewer than 25 FTEs for the taxable year, the employer is  not an eligible small employer for purposes of this section, even if  fewer than 25 employees (or FTEs) enroll for coverage through the SHOP  Exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date.

The tax credit available to an eligible small  employer equals 50 percent of the eligible small employer's premium  payments made on behalf of its employees under a qualifying arrangement,  or in the case of a tax-exempt eligible small employer, 35 percent of  the employer's premium payments made on behalf of its employees under a  qualifying arrangement.

The amount of an  eligible small employer's premium payments that is taken into account in  calculating the credit is limited to the premium payments the employer  would have made under the same arrangement if the average premium for  the small group market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls  for coverage were substituted for the actual premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An eligible small employer (Employer) offers a  health insurance plan with employee-only and SHOP dependent coverage  through a small business options program (SHOP) Exchange. Employer has 9  full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) with average annual wages of  $23,000 per FTE. All 9 employees are employees as defined under Sec.   1.45R-1(a)(5). Six employees are enrolled in employee-only coverage and  5 of these 6 employees have also enrolled either one child or one spouse  in SHOP dependent coverage. Employer pays 50% of the premiums for all  employees enrolled in employee-only coverage and 50% of the premiums for  all employees who enrolled family members in SHOP dependent coverage  (and the employee is responsible for the remainder in each case). The  premiums are $4,000 a year for employee-only coverage and $3,000 a year  for each individual enrolled in SHOP dependent coverage. The average  premium for the small group market in Employer's rating area is $5,000  for employee-only coverage and $4,000 for each individual enrolled in  SHOP dependent coverage. Employer's premium payments for each FTE  ($2,000 for employee-only coverage and $1,500 for SHOP dependent  coverage) do not exceed 50 percent of the average premium for the small  group market in Employer's rating area ($2,500 for employee-only  coverage and $2,000 for each individual enrolled in SHOP dependent  coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The amount of premiums paid by Employer for  purposes of computing the credit equals $19,500 ((6 x $2,000) plus (5 x  $1,500)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that the  premiums are $6,000 for employee-only coverage and $5,000 for each  dependent enrolled in coverage. Employer's premium payments for each  employee ($3,000 for employee-only coverage and $2,500 for SHOP  dependent coverage) exceed 50% of the average premium for the small  group market in Employer's rating area ($2,500 for self-only coverage  and $2,000 for family coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The amount of premiums paid by Employer for  purposes of computing the credit equals $25,000 ((6 x $2,500) plus (5 x  $2,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit phaseout--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The tax credit is subject to a  reduction (but not reduced below zero) if the employer's FTEs exceed 10  or average annual FTE wages exceed $25,000. If the number of FTEs  exceeds 10, the reduction is determined by multiplying the otherwise  applicable credit amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  number of FTEs in excess of 10 and the denominator of which is 15. If  average annual FTE wages exceed $25,000, the reduction is determined by  multiplying the otherwise applicable credit amount by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the amount by which average annual FTE wages  exceed $25,000 and the denominator of which is $25,000. In both cases,  the result of the calculation is subtracted from the otherwise  applicable credit to determine the credit to which the employer is  entitled. For an employer with both more than 10 FTEs and average annual  FTE wages exceeding $25,000, the total reduction is the sum of the two  reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $25,000 dollar amount adjusted for inflation. For taxable years  beginning in a calendar year after 2013, each reference to ``$25,000''  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is replaced with a dollar amount  equal to $25,000 multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment under  section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year, determined by substituting  ``calendar year 2012'' for ``calendar year 1992'' in section 1(f)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (c) this section. For purposes of these examples, no employer  is a tax-exempt organization and no other adjustments or limitations on  the credit apply other than those adjustments and limitations explicitly  set forth in the example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An eligible  small employer (Employer) has 9 FTEs with average annual wages of  $23,000. Employer pays $72,000 in health insurance premiums for those  employees (which does not exceed the total average premium for the small   group market in the rating area), and otherwise meets the requirements  for the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's credit equals $36,000 (50% x $72,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An eligible small employer (Employer) has 12 FTEs  and average annual FTE wages of $30,000 in a year when the amount in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as adjusted for inflation, is $25,000.  Employer pays $96,000 in health insurance premiums for its employees  (which does not exceed the average premium for the small group market in  the rating area) and otherwise meets the requirements for the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The initial amount of the credit is determined  before any reduction (50% x $96,000) = $48,000. The credit reduction for  FTEs in excess of 10 is $6,400 ($48,000 x 2/15). The credit reduction  for average annual FTE wages in excess of $25,000 is $9,600 ($48,000 x  $5,000/$25,000), resulting in a total credit reduction of $16,000  ($6,400 + $9,600). Employer's total tax credit equals $32,000 ($48,000- $16,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> State credits and subsidies for health insurance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payments  to employer. If the employer is entitled to a State tax credit or a  premium subsidy that is paid directly to the employer, the premium  payment made by the employer is not reduced by the credit or subsidy for  purposes of determining whether the employer has satisfied the  requirement to pay an amount equal to a uniform percentage (not less  than 50 percent) of the premium cost. Also, except as described in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the maximum amount of the credit is  not reduced by reason of a State tax credit or subsidy or by reason of  payments by a State directly to an employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments to issuer. If a State makes payments directly to an  insurance company (or another entity licensed under State law to engage  in the business of insurance) to pay a portion of the premium for  coverage of an employee enrolled for coverage through a SHOP Exchange,  the State is treated as making these payments on behalf of the employer  for purposes of determining whether the employer has satisfied the  requirement to pay an amount equal to a uniform percentage (not less  than 50 percent) of the premium cost of coverage. Also, except as  described below in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, these premium  payments by the State are treated as an employer contribution under this  section for purposes of calculating the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credits may not exceed net premium payment. Regardless of the  application of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, in no event  may the amount of the credit exceed the amount of the employer's net  premium payments as defined in Sec.  1.45R-1(a)(11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. For purposes of these  examples, each employer is an eligible small employer that is not a tax- exempt organization and the eligible small employer's taxable year and  plan year begin during or after 2014. No other adjustments or  limitations on the credit apply other than those adjustments and  limitations explicitly set forth in the example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. The State in which an eligible small employer (Employer) operates  provides a health insurance premium subsidy of up to 40% of the health  insurance premiums for each eligible employee. The State pays the  subsidy directly to Employer. Employer has one employee, Employee D.  Employee D's health insurance premiums are $100 per month and are paid  as follows: $80 by Employer and $20 by Employee D through salary  reductions to a cafeteria plan. The State pays Employer $40 per month as  a subsidy for Employer's payment of insurance premiums on behalf of  Employee D. Employer is otherwise an eligible small employer that meets  the requirements for the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of calculating the credit, the amount  of premiums paid by the employer is $80 per month (the premium payment  by the Employer without regard to the subsidy from the State). The  maximum credit is $40 ($80 x 50%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The State in which Employer operates provides a health  insurance premium subsidy of up to 30% for each eligible employee.  Employer has one employee, Employee E. Employee E is enrolled in  employee-only coverage through a qualified health plan (QHP) offered by  Employer through a SHOP Exchange. Employee E's health insurance premiums  are $100 per month and are paid as follows: $50 by Employer; $30 by the  State and $20 by the employee. The State pays the $30 per month directly  to the insurance company and the insurance company bills Employer for  the employer and employee's share, which equal   $70 per month. Employer is otherwise an eligible small employer that  meets the requirements for the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of calculating the amount of the  credit, the amount of premiums paid by Employer is $80 per month (the  sum of Employer's payment and the State's payment). The maximum credit  is $40 ($80 x 50%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. The State in which Employer operates provides a health insurance  premium subsidy of up to 50% for each eligible employee. Employer has  one employee, Employee F. Employee F is enrolled in employee-only  coverage under the QHP offered to Employee F by Employer through a SHOP  Exchange. Employee F's health insurance premiums are $100 per month and  are paid as follows: $20 by Employer; $50 by the State and $30 by  Employee F. The State pays the $50 per month directly to the insurance  company and the insurance company bills Employer for the employer's and  employee's shares, which total $50 per month. The amount of premiums  paid by Employer (the sum of Employer's payment and the State's payment)  is $70 per month, which is more than 50% of the $100 monthly premium  payment. The amount of the premium for calculating the credit is also  $70 per month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The maximum credit without adjustments or  limitations is $35 ($70 x 50%). Employer's net premium payment is $20  (the amount actually paid by Employer excluding the State subsidy).  Because the credit may not exceed Employer's net premium payment, the  credit is $20 (the lesser of $35 or $20).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Payroll tax limitation for tax-exempt eligible small employers-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For a tax-exempt eligible employer, the amount of the  credit claimed cannot exceed the total amount of payroll taxes (as  defined in Sec.  1.45R-1(a)(13)) of the employer during the calendar  year in which the taxable year begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For purposes of this example, the  eligible small employer's taxable year and plan year begin during or  after 2014. No other adjustments or limitations on the credit apply  other than those adjustments and limitations explicitly set forth in the  example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer is a tax-exempt eligible small  employer that has 10 FTEs with average annual wages of $21,000. Employer  pays $80,000 in health insurance premiums for its employees (which does  not exceed the average premium for the small group market in the rating  area) and otherwise meets the requirements for the credit. The total  amount of Employer's payroll taxes equals $30,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The initial amount of the credit is determined  before any reduction: (35% x $80,000) = $28,000, and Employer's payroll  taxes are $30,000. The total tax credit equals $28,000 (the lesser of  $28,000 and $30,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Two-consecutive-taxable-year credit period limitation. The  credit is available to an eligible small employer, including a tax- exempt eligible small employer, only during that employer's credit  period. For a transition rule for 2014, see paragraph (i) of this  section. To prevent the avoidance of the two-year limit on the credit  period through the use of successor entities, a successor entity and a  predecessor entity are treated as the same employer. For this purpose,  the rules for identifying successor entities under Sec.  31.3121(a)(1)- 1(b) apply. Accordingly, for example, if an eligible small employer  claims the credit for the 2014 and 2015 taxable years, that eligible  small employer's credit period will have expired so that any successor  employer to that eligible small employer will not be able to claim the  credit for any subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Premium payments by the employer for a taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Only premiums paid by an eligible small employer or tax-exempt  eligible small employer on behalf of each employee enrolled in a QHP or  payments paid to the issuer in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this  section are counted in calculating the credit. If an eligible small  employer pays only a portion of the premiums for the coverage provided  to employees (with employees paying the rest), only the portion paid by  the employer is taken into account. Premiums paid on behalf of seasonal  workers may be counted in determining the amount of the credit (even  though seasonal worker wages and hours of service are not included in  the FTE calculation and average annual FTE wage calculation unless the  seasonal worker works for the employer   on more than 120 days during the taxable year). Subject to the average  premium limitation, premiums paid on behalf of an employee with respect  to any individuals who are or may become eligible for coverage under the  terms of the plan because of a relationship to the employee (including  through family coverage or SHOP dependent coverage) may also be taken  into account in determining the amount of the credit. (However, premiums  paid for SHOP dependent coverage are not taken into account in  determining whether the uniform percentage requirement is met, see Sec.   1.45R-4(b)(5).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excluded amounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Salary reduction amounts. Any premium paid  pursuant to a salary reduction arrangement under a section 125 cafeteria  plan is not treated as paid by the employer for purposes of section 45R  and these regulations. For this purpose, premiums paid with employer- provided flex credits that employees may elect to receive as cash or  other taxable benefits are treated as paid pursuant to a salary  reduction arrangement under a section 125 cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> HSAs, HRAs, and FSAs. Employer contributions to, or amounts  made available under, health savings accounts, reimbursement  arrangements, and health flexible spending arrangements are not taken  into account in determining the premium payments by the employer for a  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rules applicable to trusts, estates, regulated investment  companies, real estate investment trusts and cooperative organizations.  Rules similar to the rules of section 52(d) and (e) and the regulations  thereunder apply in calculating and apportioning the credit with respect  to a trust, estate, a regulated investment company or real estate  investment trusts or cooperative organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transition rule for 2014--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (i)  applies if as of August 26, 2013, an eligible small employer offers  coverage for a health plan year that begins on a date other than the  first day of its taxable year. In such a case, if the eligible small  employer has a health plan year beginning after January 1, 2014 but  before January 1, 2015 (2014 health plan year) that begins after the  start of its first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2014  (2014 taxable year), and the employer offers one or more QHPs to its  employees through a SHOP Exchange as of the first day of its 2014 health  plan year, then the eligible small employer is treated as offering  coverage through a SHOP Exchange for its entire 2014 taxable year for  purposes of section 45R if the health care coverage provided from the  first day of the 2014 taxable year through the day immediately preceding  the first day of the 2014 health plan year would have qualified for a  credit under section 45R using the rules applicable to taxable years  beginning before January 1, 2014. If the eligible small employer claims  the section 45R credit in the 2014 taxable year, the 2014 taxable year  begins the first year of the credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rule of this  paragraph (i) of this section. For purposes of this example, it is  assumed that the eligible small employer is not a tax-exempt  organization and that no other adjustments or limitations on the credit  apply other than those adjustments and limitations explicitly set forth  in the example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An eligible small employer (Employer) has a 2014  taxable year that begins January 1, 2014 and ends on December 31, 2014.  As of August 26, 2013, Employer had a 2014 health plan year that begins  July 1, 2014 and ends June 30, 2015. Employer offers a QHP through a  SHOP Exchange the coverage under which begins July 1, 2014. Employer  also provides other coverage from January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014  that would have qualified for a credit under section 45R based on the  rules applicable to taxable years beginning before 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer may claim the credit at the 50% rate under  section 45R for the entire 2014 taxable year using the rules under this  paragraph (i) of this section. Accordingly, in calculating the credit,  Employer may count premiums paid for the coverage from January 1, 2014  through June 30, 2014, as well as premiums paid for the coverage from  July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. If Employer claims the credit  for the 2014 taxable year, that taxable year is the first year of the  credit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability date.

If a plan of an employer provides a wellness  program, for purposes of meeting the uniform percentage requirement any  additional amount of the employer contribution attributable to an  employee's participation in the wellness program over the employer  contribution with respect to an employee that does not participate in  the wellness program is not taken into account in calculating the  uniform percentage requirement, whether the difference is due to a  discount for participation or a surcharge for nonparticipation. The  employer contribution for employees that do not participate in the  wellness program must be at least 50 percent of the premium (including  any premium surcharge for nonparticipation). However, for purposes of  computing the credit, the employer contributions are taken into account,  including those contributions attributable to an employee's  participation in a wellness program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules regarding employer compliance with applicable  State or local law. An employer will be treated as satisfying the  uniform percentage requirement if the failure to otherwise satisfy the  uniform percentage requirement is attributable solely to additional  employer contributions made to certain employees to comply with an  applicable State or local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An eligible small employer (Employer) offers a  QHP on a SHOP Exchange, Plan A, which uses composite billing. The  premiums for Plan A are $5,000 per year for employee-only coverage, and  $10,000 for family coverage. Employees can elect employee-only or family  coverage under Plan A. Employer pays $3,000 (60% of the premium) toward  employee-only coverage under Plan A and $6,000 (60% of the premium)  toward family coverage under Plan A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contributions of 60% of the premium for  each tier of coverage satisfy the uniform percentage requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that Employer  pays $3,000 (60% of the premium) for each employee electing employee- only coverage under Plan A and pays $3,000 (30% of the premium) for each  employee electing family coverage under Plan A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contributions of 60% of the premium  toward employee-only coverage and the same dollar amount toward the  premium for family coverage satisfy the uniform percentage requirement,  even though the percentage is not the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer offers two QHPs, Plan A and Plan B,  both of which use composite billing. The premiums for Plan A   are $5,000 per year for employee-only coverage and $10,000 for family  coverage. The premiums for Plan B are $7,000 per year for employee-only  coverage and $13,000 for family coverage. Employees can elect employee- only or family coverage under either Plan A or Plan B. Employer pays  $3,000 (60% of the premium) for each employee electing employee-only  coverage under Plan A, $3,000 (30% of the premium) for each employee  electing family coverage under Plan A, $3,500 (50% of the premium) for  each employee electing employee-only coverage under Plan B, and $3,500  (27% of the premium) for each employee electing family coverage under  Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contributions of 60% (or $3,000) of the  premiums for employee-only coverage and the same dollar amounts toward  the premium for family coverage under Plan A, and of 50% (or $3,500) of  the premium for employee-only of coverage and the same dollar amount  toward the premium for family coverage under Plan B, satisfy the uniform  percentage requirement on a QHP-by-QHP basis; therefore the employer's  contributions to both plans satisfy the uniform percentage requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 3, except that Employer  designates Plan A as the reference QHP. Employer pays $2,500 (50% of the  premium) for each employee electing employee-only coverage under Plan A  and pays $2,500 of the premium for each employee electing family  coverage under Plan A or either employee-only or family coverage under  Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contribution of 50% (or $2,500) toward  the premium of each employee enrolled under Plan A or Plan B satisfies  the uniform percentage requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer receives a list billing premium quote  with respect to Plan X, a QHP offered by Employer on a SHOP Exchange for  health insurance coverage for each of Employer's four employees. For  Employee L, age 20, the employee-only premium is $3,000 per year, and  the family premium is $8,000. For Employees M, N and O, each age 40, the  employee-only premium is $5,000 per year and the family premium is  $10,000. The total employee-only premium for the four employees is  $18,000 ($3,000 + (3 x 5,000)). Employer calculates an employer-computed  composite employee-only rate of $4,500 ($18,000/4). Employer offers to  make contributions such that each employee would need to pay $2,000 of  the premium for employee-only coverage. Under this arrangement, Employer  would contribute $1,000 toward employee-only coverage for L and $3,000  toward employee-only coverage for M, N, and O. In the event an employee  elects family coverage, Employer would make the same contribution  ($1,000 for L or $3,000 for M, N, or O) toward the family premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement because it offers and makes contributions based on an  employer-calculated composite employee-only rate such that, to receive  employee-only coverage, each employee must pay a uniform amount which is  not more than 50% of the composite rate, and it allows employees to use  the same employer contributions toward family coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 5, except that Employer  calculates an employer-computed composite family rate of $9,500 (($8,000  + 3 x 10,000)/4) and requires each employee to pay $4,000 of the premium  for family coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement because it offers and makes contributions based on a  calculated employee-only and family rate such that, to receive either  employee-only or family coverage, each employee must pay a uniform  amount which is not more than 50% of the composite rate for coverage of  that tier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 5, except that Employer  also receives a list billing premium quote from Plan Y with respect to a  second QHP offered by Employer on a SHOP Exchange for each of Employer's  4 employees. Plan Y's quote for Employee L, age 20, is $4,000 per year  for employee-only coverage or $12,000 per year for family coverage. For  Employees M, N and O, each age 40, the premium is $7,000 per year for  employee-only coverage or $15,000 per year for family coverage. The  total employee-only premium under Plan Y is $25,000 ($4,000 + (3 x  7,000)). The employer-computed composite employee-only rate is $6,250  ($25,000/4). Employer designates Plan X as the reference plan. Employer  offers to make contributions based on the employer-calculated composite  premium for the reference QHP (Plan X) such that each employee has to  contribute $2,000 to receive employee-only coverage through Plan X.  Under this arrangement, Employer would contribute $1,000 toward  employee-only coverage for L and $3,000 toward employee-only coverage  for M, N, and O. In the event an employee elects family coverage through  Plan X or either employee-only or family coverage through Plan Y,  Employer would make the same contributions ($1,000 for L or $3,000 for  M, N, or O) toward that coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement because it offers and makes contributions based on the  employer-calculated composite employee-only premium for the Plan X  reference QHP such that, in order to receive employee-only coverage,  each employee must pay a uniform amount which is not more than 50% of  the employee-only composite premium of the reference QHP; it allows  employees to use the same employer contributions toward   family coverage in the reference QHP or coverage through another QHPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer offers employee-only and SHOP  dependent coverage through a QHP to its three employees using list  billing. All three employees enroll in the employee-only coverage, and  one employee elects to enroll two dependents in SHOP dependent coverage.  Employer contributes 100% of the employee-only premium costs, but only  contributes 25% of the premium costs toward SHOP dependent coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contribution of 100% toward the premium  costs of employee-only coverage satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement, even though Employer is only contributing 25% toward SHOP  dependent coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer has five employees. Employer is  located in a State that requires employers to pay 50% of employees'  premium costs, but also requires that an employee's contribution not  exceed a certain percentage of the employee's monthly gross earnings  from that employer. Employer offers to pay 50% of the premium costs for  all its employees, and to comply with the State law, Employer  contributes more than 50% of the premium costs for two of its employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement because its failure to otherwise satisfy the uniform  percentage requirement is attributable solely to compliance with the  applicable State or local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer has three employees who all enroll  in employee-only coverage. Employer is located in a State that has a  tobacco surcharge on the premiums of employees who use tobacco. One of  Employer's employees smokes. Employer contributes 50% of the employee- only premium costs, but does not cover any of the tobacco surcharge for  the employee who smokes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contribution of 50% toward the premium  costs of employee-only coverage satisfies the uniform percentage  requirement. Tobacco surcharges are not factored into premiums when  calculating the uniform percentage requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer has five employees who all enroll in  employee-only coverage. Employer offers a wellness program that reduces  the employee share of the premium for employees who participate in the  wellness program. Employer contributes 50% of the premium costs of  employee-only coverage for employees who do not participate in the  wellness program and 55% of the premium costs of employee-only coverage  for employees who participate in the wellness program. Three of the five  employees participate in the wellness program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer's contribution of 50% toward the premium  costs of employee-only coverage for the two employees who do not  participate in the wellness program and 55% toward the premium costs of  employee-only coverage for three employees who participate in the  wellness program satisfies the uniform percentage requirement because  the additional 5% contribution due to the employees' participation in  the wellness program is not taken into account. However, the additional  5% contributions are taken into account for purposes of calculating the  credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for  periods after 2013. For transition rules relating to certain plan years  starting in 2014, see Sec.  1.45R-3(i).  [T.D. 9672, 79 FR 36646, June 30, 2014]    Sec.  1.45R-5  Claiming the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Claiming the credit. The credit is a general business credit. It  is claimed on an eligible small employer's annual income tax return and  offsets an employer's actual tax liability for the year. The credit is  claimed by attaching Form 8941, ``Credit for Small Employer Health  Insurance Premiums,'' to the eligible small employer's income tax return  or, in the case of a tax-exempt eligible small employer, by attaching  Form 8941 to the employer's Form 990-T, ``Exempt Organization Business  Income Tax Return.'' To claim the credit, a tax-exempt eligible small  employer must file a form 990-T with an attached Form 8941, even if a  Form 990-T would not otherwise be required to be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Estimated tax payments and alternative minimum tax (AMT)  liability. An eligible small employer may reflect the credit in  determining estimated tax payments for the year in which the credit  applies in accordance with the estimated tax rules as set forth in  sections 6654 and 6655 and the applicable regulations. An eligible small  employer may also use the credit to offset the employer's alternative  minimum tax (AMT) liability for the year, if any, subject to certain  limitations based on the amount of the employer's regular tax liability,  AMT liability and other allowable credits. See section 38(c)(1), as  modified by section 38(c)(4)(B)(vi). However, an eligible small  employer, including a tax-exempt eligible small employer, may not reduce  its deposits and payments of employment tax (that   is, income tax required to be withheld under section 3402, social  security and Medicare tax under sections 3101 and 3111, and federal  unemployment tax under section 3301) during the year in anticipation of  the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of section 162 deduction. No deduction under section  162 is allowed for the eligible small employer for that portion of the  health insurance premiums that is equal to the amount of the credit  under Sec.  1.45R-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for  periods after 2013. For rules relating to certain plan years beginning  in 2014, see Sec.  1.45R-3(i).  [T.D. 9672, 79 FR 36646, June 30, 2014]</p>
