                                Sec. 1.1082-5  Basis of property acquired by shareholder upon tax-free
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Stock or securities. If there was distributed to a shareholder  in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority- owned subsidiary company, stock or securities (other than stock or  securities which are nonexempt property), and if by virtue of section  1081 (c)(1) no gain was recognized to the shareholder upon such  distribution, then the basis of the stock in respect of which the  distribution was made must be apportioned between such stock and the  stock or securities so distributed to the shareholder. The basis of the  old shares and the stock or securities received upon the distribution  shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the stock or securities received upon the distribution  consist solely of stock in the distributing corporation and the stock  received is all of substantially the same character and preference as  the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the basis of  each share will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the old  shares of stock divided by the total number of the old and the new  shares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the stock or securities received upon the distribution are in  whole or in part stock in a corporation other than the distributing  corporation, or are in whole or in part stock of a character or  preference materially different from the stock in respect of which the  distribution is made, or if the distribution consists in whole or in  part of securities other than stock, the cost or other basis of the  stock in respect of which the distribution is made shall be apportioned  between such stock and the   stock or securities distributed in proportion, as nearly as may be, to  the respective values of each class of stock or security, old and new,  at the time of such distribution, and the basis of each share of stock  or unit of security will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of  the class of stock or security to which such share or unit belongs,  divided by the number of shares or units in the class. Within the  meaning of this subparagraph, stocks or securities in one corporation  are different in class from stocks or securities in another corporation,  and, in general, any material difference in character or preference or  terms sufficient to distinguish one stock or security from another stock  or security, so that different values may properly be assigned thereto,  will constitute a difference in class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stock rights. If there was distributed to a shareholder in a  corporation rights to acquire common stock in a second corporation, and  if by virtue of section 1081 (c)(2) no gain was recognized to the  shareholder upon such distribution, then the basis of the stock in  respect of which the distribution was made must be apportioned between  such stock and the stock rights so distributed to the shareholder. The  basis of such stock and the stock rights received upon the distribution  shall be determined in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost or other basis of the stock in respect of which the  distribution is made shall be apportioned between such stock and the  stock rights distributed, in proportion to the respective values thereof  at the time the rights are issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The basis for determining gain or loss from the sale of a right,  or from the sale of a share of stock in respect of which the  distribution is made, will be the quotient of the cost or other basis,  properly adjusted, assigned to the rights or the stock, divided, as the  case may be, by the number of rights acquired or by the number of shares  of such stock held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross reference. As to the basis of stock or securities  distributed by one member of a system group to another member of the  same system group, see Sec. 1.1082-6.</p>
