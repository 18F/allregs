                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assistance in the initial PHA jurisdiction. The family may  receive tenant-based assistance to lease a unit located anywhere in the  jurisdiction (as determined by State and local law) of the initial PHA.  HUD may nevertheless restrict the family's right to lease such a unit  anywhere in such jurisdiction if HUD determines that limitations on a  family's opportunity to select among available units in that  jurisdiction are appropriate to achieve desegregation goals in  accordance with obligations generated by a court order or consent  decree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Portability: Assistance outside the initial PHA jurisdiction.  Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, and to Sec. 982.552 and Sec.  982.553, a voucher-holder or participant family has the right to receive  tenant-based voucher assistance in accordance with requirements of this  part to lease a unit outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, anywhere in  the United States, in the jurisdiction of a PHA with a tenant-based  program under this part. The initial PHA must not provide such portable  assistance for a participant if the family has moved out of the assisted  unit in violation of the lease, except that if the family moves out in  violation of the lease in order to protect the health or safety of a  person who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating  violence, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was  imminently threatened by harm from further violence if he or she  remained in the dwelling unit, and has otherwise complied with all other  obligations under the Section 8 program, the family may receive a  voucher from the PHA and move to another jurisdiction under the Housing  Choice Voucher Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonresident applicants. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (c) applies if  neither the household head or spouse of an assisted family already had a  ``domicile'' (legal residence) in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA at  the time when the family first submitted an application for  participation in the program to the initial PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following apply during the 12 month period from the time  when a family described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is admitted  to the program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The family may lease a unit anywhere in the jurisdiction of the  initial PHA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The family does not have any right to portability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The initial PHA may choose to allow portability during this  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If both the initial PHA and a receiving PHA agree, the family  may lease a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Income eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For admission to the program, a family  must be income eligible in the area where the family initially leases a  unit with assistance under the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a portable family is a participant in the initial PHA Section  8 tenant-based program (either the PHA voucher program or the PHA  certificate program), income eligibility is not redetermined when the  family moves to the receiving PHA program under portability procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a  portable family must be income eligible for admission to the voucher  program in the area where the family leases a unit under portability  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Leasing in-place. If the dwelling unit is approvable, a family  may select the dwelling unit occupied by the family before selection for  participation in the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Freedom of choice. The PHA may not directly or indirectly reduce  the family's opportunity to select among available units except as  provided in   paragraph (a) of this section, or elsewhere in this part 982 (e.g.  prohibition on use of ineligible housing, housing not meeting HQS, or  housing for which the rent to owner exceeds a reasonable rent).
