This section provides an  exemption from the minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor  provisions of the Act for certain homeworkers employed in making wreaths  from evergreens and in harvesting evergreens and other forest products  for use in making wreaths. Attention is directed to the fact that a  limited overtime exemption for employees employed in the decoration  greens industry is provided under section 7(c) of the Act (see part 526  of this   chapter). The section 7(c) exemption is not limited to homeworkers.</p>
