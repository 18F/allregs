Load Response Test data submissions are not necessary for carry-over engine families for which Load Response Test data has been previously submitted. In addition, upon approval of the Administrator, manufacturers may carry Load Response Test data across from one engine family to other engine families, provided that the carry-across engine families use similar emission control technology hardware which would be expected to result in the generation of similar emission data when run over the Load Response Test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Upon request from EPA, a manufacturer must provide to EPA any hardware (including scan tools), passwords, and/or documentation necessary

for EPA to read, interpret, and store (in engineering units if applicable) any information broadcast by an engine's on-board computers and electronic control modules which relates in any way to emission control devices and auxiliary emission control devices, provided that such hardware, passwords, or documentation exists and is not otherwise commercially available. Passwords include any information necessary to enable generic scan tools or personal computers access to proprietary emission related information broadcast by an engine's on-board computer, if such passwords exist. This requirement includes access by EPA to any proprietary code information which may be broadcast by an engine's on-board computer and electronic control modules. Information which is confidential business information must be marked as such. Engineering units refers to the ability to read, interpret, and store information in commonly understood engineering units, for example, engine speed in revolutions per minute or per second, injection timing parameters such as start of injection in degree's before top-dead center, fueling rates in cubic centimeters per stroke, vehicle speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour. This paragraph (n) does not restrict EPA authority to take any action authorized by section 208 of the Clean Air Act.
