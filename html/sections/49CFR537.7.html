If a computer tape is used, any NHTSA approved fixed format structure may be used, but each vehicle configuration record should identify the manufacturer, model type, and for light trucks the drive wheel code, e.g., 2 or 4 wheel drive. At least the information categories specified here and in paragraph (c)(4) of this section must be provided, but if preferred the tape may contain any additional categories. Each computer tape record must contain all the required categories of information to enable direct reading and interpretation in the fixed format that was approved.
