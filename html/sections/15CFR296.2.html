A  cost may not be allocated to an award as a direct cost if any other cost  incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been assigned to  an award as an indirect cost. Because of the diverse characteristics and  accounting practices of different organizations, it is not possible to  specify the types of costs which may be classified as direct costs in  all situations. However, typical direct costs could include salaries of  personnel working on the TIP project, travel, equipment, materials and  supplies, subcontracts, and other costs not categorized in the preceding  examples. NIST shall determine the allowability of direct costs in  accordance with applicable Federal cost principles.</p><p class="depth0">Director means the Director of the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST).</p><p class="depth0">Eligible company means a small-sized or medium-sized business or  company that satisfies the ownership and other requirements stated in  this part.</p><p class="depth0">Grant means a Federal assistance instrument used whenever the  principal purpose of the relationship between the Federal government and  the recipient is to transfer something of value, such as money,  property, or services to the recipient to accomplish a public purpose of  support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute instead of  acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the  direct benefit or use of the Federal government; and no substantial  involvement is anticipated between the Federal government and the  recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.</p><p class="depth0">High-risk, high-reward research means research that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Has the potential for yielding transformational results with  far-ranging or wide-ranging implications;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Addresses areas of critical national need that support, promote,  and accelerate innovation in the United States and is within NIST's  areas of technical competence; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Is too novel or spans too diverse a range of disciplines to fare  well in the traditional peer-review process.</p><p class="depth0">Indirect costs means those costs incurred for common or joint  objectives that cannot be readily identified with activities carried out  in support of a particular final objective. A cost may not be allocated  to an award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same  purpose in like circumstances has been assigned to an award as a direct  cost. Because of diverse characteristics and accounting practices it is  not possible to specify the types of costs which may be classified as  indirect costs in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect  costs include general administration expenses, such as the salaries and  expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, maintenance,  library expenses, and accounting. NIST shall determine the allowability  of indirect costs in accordance with applicable Federal cost principles.</p><p class="depth0">Institution of higher education means an educational institution in  any State that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of  graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the  recognized equivalent of such a certificate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Is legally authorized within such State to provide a program of  education beyond secondary education;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Provides an educational program for which the institution awards  a bachelor's degree or provides not less than a 2-year program that is  acceptable for full credit toward such a degree;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Is a public or other nonprofit institution; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or  association, or if not so accredited, is an institution that has been  granted preaccreditation status by such an agency or association that  has been recognized by the Secretary of Education for the granting of   preaccreditation status, and the Secretary of Education has determined  that there is satisfactory assurance that the institution will meet the  accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a  reasonable time (20 U.S.C. 1001).

Sources of revenue to satisfy the  required cost share include cash and third party in-kind contributions.  Cash may be contributed by any non-Federal source, including but not  limited to recipients, state and local governments, companies, and  nonprofits (except contractors working on a TIP project). Third party  in-kind contributions include but are not limited to equipment, research  tools, software, supplies, and/or services. The value of in-kind  contributions shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 14.23 of this  title and will be prorated according to the share of total use dedicated  to the TIP project.
