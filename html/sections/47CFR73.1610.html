compliance with the terms of the construction permit, the technical provisions of the application therefore, the rules and regulations and the applicable engineering standards. For AM stations, equipment tests, including either a directional or nondirectional proof of performance required by the construction permit, may be conducted during daytime hours provided that the antenna system is first substantially tuned during the experimental period. The nondirectional proof shall be conducted with power adjusted to 25% of that specified in the permit for the authorized directional facilities or, if applicable, to such higher power as is specified in the same permit for authorized nondirectional facilities. For licensed stations, see Sec.  73.1615, Operation During Modification of Facilities; and Sec.  73.157, Antenna Testing During Daytime.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FCC may notify the permittee not to conduct equipment tests or may modify, cancel, suspend, or change the modes of testing or the dates and times for such tests in order to resolve interference complaints or when such action may appear to be in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equipment tests may be continued so long as the construction permit shall remain valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The authorization for tests embodied in this section shall not be construed as constituting a license to operate but as a necessary part of construction.
