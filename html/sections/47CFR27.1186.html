                            <p class="depth0">Payment of cost-sharing obligations for the relocation of BRS systems in the 2150-60/62 MHz band is subject to the rules set forth in Sec. 27.1170. If an AWS licensee is initiating operations for a newly constructed site or modified existing site in licensed bands overlapping the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the AWS licensee must file with the clearinghouse, in addition to the site-specific data required by Sec. 27.1170, the above ground level height of the transmitting antenna centerline. AWS entities have a continuing duty to maintain the accuracy of the site-specific data on file with the clearinghouse.
