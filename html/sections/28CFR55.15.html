                            <p class="depth0">The requirements of sections 4(f)(4) and 203(c) apply with regard to the provision of ``any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots.'' The basic purpose of these requirements is to allow members of applicable language minority groups to be effectively informed of and participate effectively in voting-connected activities. Accordingly, the quoted language should be broadly construed to apply to all stages of the electoral process, from voter registration through activities related to conducting elections, including, for example the issuance, at any time during the year, of notifications, announcements, or other informational materials concerning the opportunity to register, the deadline for voter registration, the time, places and subject matters of elections, and the absentee voting process.</p>
