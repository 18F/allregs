                            <p class="depth0">Upon the effective date of designation of a State under paragraph  5(c) of the Act, no poultry products can be processed within the State  unless they are prepared under inspection pursuant to the regulations or  are exempted from the requirement of inspection   under Sec. 381.10, and no unexempted poultry products which were  processed without any inspection can lawfully be distributed within the  State. For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such  designation, poultry products which were processed in any State listed  in Sec. 381.187 and inspected and passed under the supervision of a  responsible State or local inspection agency or exempted from State  inspection can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are  not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection  legend shall not be used. Such products may not enter official  establishments. After said 90-day period, only federally inspected and  passed products may be distributed within the designated State, except  as provided in Sec. 381.10.</p>
