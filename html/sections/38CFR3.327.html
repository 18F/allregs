                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Reexaminations, including periods of hospital observation, will be requested whenever VA determines there is a need to verify either the continued existence or the current severity of a disability. Generally, reexaminations will be required if it is likely that a disability has improved, or if evidence indicates there has been a material change in a disability or that the current rating may be incorrect. Individuals for whom reexaminations have been authorized and scheduled are required to report for such reexaminations. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provide general guidelines for requesting reexaminations, but shall not be construed as limiting VA's authority to request reexaminations, or periods of hospital observation, at any time in order to ensure that a disability is accurately rated.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compensation cases--(1) Scheduling reexaminations. Assignment of a

prestabilization rating requires reexamination within the second 6 months period following separation from service. Following initial Department of Veterans Affairs examination, or any scheduled future or other examination, reexamination, if in order, will be scheduled within not less than 2 years nor more than 5 years within the judgment of the rating board, unless another time period is elsewhere specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scheduling reexaminations.

In service-connected cases, no periodic reexamination will be scheduled: (i) When the disability is established as static;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the findings and symptoms are shown by examinations scheduled in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section or other examinations and hospital reports to have persisted without material improvement for a period of 5 years or more;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where the disability from disease is permanent in character and of such nature that there is no likelihood of improvement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In cases of veterans over 55 years of age, except under unusual circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When the rating is a prescribed scheduled minimum rating; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Where a combined disability evaluation would not be affected if the future examination should result in reduced evaluation for one or more conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pension cases. In nonservice-connected cases in which the permanent total disability has been confirmed by reexamination or by the history of the case, or with obviously static disabilities, further reexaminations will not generally be requested. In other cases further examination will not be requested routinely and will be accomplished only if considered necessary based upon the particular facts of the individual case. In the cases of veterans over 55 years of age, reexamination will be requested only under unusual circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Cross Reference: Failure to report for VA examination.

Sec.  3.328  lndependent medical opinions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. When warranted by the medical complexity or controversy involved in a pending claim, an advisory medical opinion may be obtained from one or more medical experts who are not employees of VA. Opinions shall be obtained from recognized medical schools, universities, clinics or medical institutions with which arrangements for such opinions have been made, and an appropriate official of the institution shall select the individual expert(s) to render an opinion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requests. A request for an independent medical opinion in conjunction with a claim pending at the regional office level may be initiated by the office having jurisdiction over the claim, by the claimant, or by his or her duly appointed representative. The request must be submitted in writing and must set forth in detail the reasons why the opinion is necessary. All such requests shall be submitted through the Veterans Service Center Manager or Pension Management Center Manager of the office having jurisdiction over the claim, and those requests which in the judgment of the Veterans Service Center Manager or Pension Management Center Manager merit consideration shall be referred to the Compensation Service or the Pension and Fiduciary Service for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Approval. Approval shall be granted only upon a determination by the Compensation Service or the Pension and Fiduciary Service that the issue under consideration poses a medical problem of such obscurity or complexity, or has generated such controversy in the medical community at large, as to justify solicitation of an independent medical opinion. When approval has been granted, the Compensation Service or the Pension and Fiduciary Service shall obtain the opinion. A determination that an independent medical opinion is not warranted may be contested only as part of an appeal on the merits of the decision rendered on the primary issue by the agency of original jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notification. The Compensation Service or the Pension and Fiduciary Service shall notify the claimant when the request for an independent medical opinion has been approved with regard

to his or her claim and shall furnish the claimant with a copy of the opinion when it is received. If, in the judgment of the Secretary, disclosure of the independent medical opinion would be harmful to the physical or mental health of the claimant, disclosure shall be subject to the special procedures set forth in Sec.  1.577 of this chapter.
