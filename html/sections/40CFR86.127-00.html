                            <p class="depth0">Applicability. The procedures described in this and subsequent  sections are used to determine the conformity of vehicles with the  standards set forth in subpart A or S of this part (as applicable) for  light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Except where noted, the  procedures of paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section, Sec. 86.127-96  (c) and (d), and the contents of Secs. 86.135-94, 86.136-90, 86.137-96,  86.140-94, 86.142-90, and 86.144-94 are applicable for determining  emission results for vehicle exhaust emission systems designed to comply  with the FTP emission standards, or the FTP emission element required  for determining compliance with composite SFTP standards. Paragraphs (f)  and (g) of this section discuss the additional test elements of  aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03) that comprise the  exhaust emission components of the SFTP. Section 86.127-96(e) discusses  fuel spitback emissions and paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section are  applicable to all vehicle emission test procedures. Section 86.127-00  includes text that specifies requirements that differ from Sec. 86.127- 96. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.127-96 is identical and applicable to  Sec. 86.127-00, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding  paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.127- 96.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling,  parking, and operating test conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or  all of the following emissions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gaseous exhaust THC, CO, NOX. CO2 (for  petroleum-fueled and gaseous- fueled vehicles), plus CH3OH  and HCHO for methanol-fueled vehicles, plus CH4 (for vehicles  subject to the NMHC and NMHCE standards).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particulates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and  gaseous-fueled vehicles) and CH3OH (for methanol-fueled  vehicles). The evaporative testing portion of the procedure occurs after  the exhaust emission test; however, exhaust emissions need not be  sampled to complete a test for evaporative emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fuel spitback (this test is not required for gaseous-fueled  vehicles).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FTP Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to  determine gaseous THC, CO, CO2, CH4,  NOX, and particulate mass emissions from gasoline-fueled,  methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles as well as  methanol and formaldehyde from methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles,  while simulating an average trip in an urban area of 11 miles (18  kilometers). The test consists of engine start-ups and vehicle operation  on a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving schedule (see  paragraph (a), EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, of appendix I to  this part). A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected  continuously for subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable  dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi sampler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)-(e)</em> [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.127-96.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The element of the SFTP for exhaust emissions related to  aggressive driving (US06) is designed to determine gaseous THC, NMHC,  CO, CO2, CH4, and NOX emissions from  gasoline-fueled or diesel-fueled vehicles (see Sec. 86.158-00  Supplemental test procedures; overview, and Sec. 86.159-00 Exhaust  emission test procedures for US06 emissions). The test cycle simulates  urban driving speeds and accelerations that are not represented by the  FTP Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule simulated trips discussed in  paragraph (b) of this section. The test consists of vehicle operation on  a chassis dynamometer   through a specified driving cycle (see paragraph (g), US06 Dynamometer  Driving Schedule, of appendix I to this part). A proportional part of  the diluted exhaust is collected continuously for subsequent analysis,  using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow  venturi sampler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The element of the SFTP related to the increased exhaust  emissions caused by air conditioning operation (SC03) is designed to  determine gaseous THC, NMHC, CO, CO2, CH4, and  NOX emissions from gasoline-fueled or diesel fueled vehicles  related to air conditioning use (see Sec. 86.158-00 Supplemental federal  test procedures; overview and Sec. 86.160-00 Exhaust emission test  procedure for SC03 emissions). The test cycle simulates urban driving  behavior with the air conditioner operating. The test consists of engine  startups and vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through  specified driving cycles (see paragraph (h), SC03 Dynamometer Driving  Schedule, of appendix I to this part). A proportional part of the  diluted exhaust is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using  a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi  sampler. The testing sequence includes an approved preconditioning  cycle, a 10 minute soak with the engine turned off, and the SC03 cycle  with measured exhaust emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The SC03 air conditioning test is conducted with the air  conditioner operating at specified settings and the ambient test  conditions of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Air temperature of 95 F;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 100 grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent  relative humidity);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Simulated solar heat intensity of 850 W/m \2\ (see  Sec. 86.161-00(d)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> air flow directed at the vehicle that will provide  representative air conditioner system condenser cooling at all vehicle  speeds (see Sec. 86.161-00(e)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers have the option of simulating air conditioning  operation during testing at other ambient test conditions provided they  can demonstrate that the vehicle tail pipe exhaust emissions are  representative of the emissions that would result from the SC03 cycle  test procedure and the ambient conditions of paragraph (g)(2) of this  section. The Administrator has approved two optional air conditioning  test simulation procedures AC1 and AC2 (see Sec. 86.162-00) for only the  model years of 2000 through 2002. If a manufacturer desires to conduct  simulation SC03 testing for model year 2003 and beyond, the simulation  test procedure must be approved in advance by the Administrator (see  Secs. 86.162-00 and 86.163-00).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all  emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor  vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart.  Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be  authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.098-25 or Sec. 86.1834-01 as  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Background concentrations are measured for all species for which  emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires  sampling and analysis of the dilution air. For evaporative testing, this  requires measuring initial concentrations. (When testing methanol-fueled  vehicles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background  concentrations of methanol and/or formaldehyde, and then assume that the  concentrations are zero during calculations.)
