The day portion of the field for these contracts contains spaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Strike price. This is a signed numeric field for reporting options strike prices.

Record type is used to correct errors or delete records that have previously been submitted. Valid values are ``A'', ``C'', ``D'' or ``blank''. An A or ``blank'' is used in this field for all new records. If the record corrects information for a previously provided record, this field must contain a ``C'' or ``blank'' and the record must contain all information on the previously transmitted record. If the record deletes information on a previously provided record, this field must contain a ``D'' and all information on the previously transmitted record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Correction of errors and omissions.
